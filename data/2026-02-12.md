### [1] [Multi-encoder ConvNeXt Network with Smooth Attentional Feature Fusion for Multispectral Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10137)
*Leo Thomas Ramos,Angel D. Sappa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeCSAFNet is a multi-branch encoder-decoder architecture for land cover segmentation that processes visible and non-visible spectral channels separately, uses attention-enhanced feature fusion, and achieves significant performance gains over existing methods while offering efficient variants for resource-constrained deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for effective land cover segmentation in multispectral imagery by leveraging both visible and non-visible spectral information. Current methods may not optimally process different spectral configurations or efficiently fuse multi-scale features from diverse spectral bands.

Method: MeCSAFNet uses dual ConvNeXt encoders to separately process visible and non-visible channels, followed by individual decoders for spatial reconstruction. A dedicated fusion decoder integrates intermediate features at multiple scales, enhanced with CBAM attention. The model employs ASAU activation for stable optimization and supports both 4-channel (RGB+NIR) and 6-channel (with NDVI/NDWI) inputs.

Result: On FBP dataset, MeCSAFNet-base (6c) outperforms U-Net (4c) by +19.21%, U-Net (6c) by +14.72%, SegFormer (4c) by +19.62%, and SegFormer (6c) by +14.74% in mIoU. On Potsdam dataset, MeCSAFNet-large (4c) improves over DeepLabV3+ (4c) by +6.48%, DeepLabV3+ (6c) by +5.85%, SegFormer (4c) by +9.11%, and SegFormer (6c) by +4.80% in mIoU. Compact variants offer notable performance with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: MeCSAFNet demonstrates superior land cover segmentation performance by effectively processing and fusing multi-spectral information through its multi-branch architecture with attention-enhanced fusion. The model's ability to handle different spectral configurations and its efficient variants make it suitable for both high-performance and resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: This work proposes MeCSAFNet, a multi-branch encoder-decoder architecture for land cover segmentation in multispectral imagery. The model separately processes visible and non-visible channels through dual ConvNeXt encoders, followed by individual decoders that reconstruct spatial information. A dedicated fusion decoder integrates intermediate features at multiple scales, combining fine spatial cues with high-level spectral representations. The feature fusion is further enhanced with CBAM attention, and the ASAU activation function contributes to stable and efficient optimization. The model is designed to process different spectral configurations, including a 4-channel (4c) input combining RGB and NIR bands, as well as a 6-channel (6c) input incorporating NDVI and NDWI indices. Experiments on the Five-Billion-Pixels (FBP) and Potsdam datasets demonstrate significant performance gains. On FBP, MeCSAFNet-base (6c) surpasses U-Net (4c) by +19.21%, U-Net (6c) by +14.72%, SegFormer (4c) by +19.62%, and SegFormer (6c) by +14.74% in mIoU. On Potsdam, MeCSAFNet-large (4c) improves over DeepLabV3+ (4c) by +6.48%, DeepLabV3+ (6c) by +5.85%, SegFormer (4c) by +9.11%, and SegFormer (6c) by +4.80% in mIoU. The model also achieves consistent gains over several recent state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, compact variants of MeCSAFNet deliver notable performance with lower training time and reduced inference cost, supporting their deployment in resource-constrained environments.

*Zhihang Yi,Jian Zhao,Jiancheng Lv,Tao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey on multimodal large language models for chart understanding, covering challenges, tasks, methodologies, and future directions in chart information fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chart understanding requires integrating graphical and textual data, but the field of MLLM-based chart analysis is fragmented and lacks systematic organization. The survey aims to provide a structured roadmap for this emerging domain.

Method: The survey structures the domain by analyzing fundamental challenges of visual-linguistic fusion, categorizing downstream tasks and datasets with a novel taxonomy, and presenting methodological evolution from classic deep learning to state-of-the-art MLLM paradigms with sophisticated fusion strategies.

Result: The survey provides a comprehensive roadmap that critically examines current model limitations (perceptual and reasoning deficits) and identifies promising future directions including advanced alignment techniques and reinforcement learning for cognitive enhancement.

Conclusion: This survey equips researchers with structured understanding of how MLLMs transform chart information fusion and aims to catalyze progress toward more robust and reliable chart understanding systems.

Abstract: Chart understanding is a quintessential information fusion task, requiring the seamless integration of graphical and textual data to extract meaning. The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized this domain, yet the landscape of MLLM-based chart analysis remains fragmented and lacks systematic organization. This survey provides a comprehensive roadmap of this nascent frontier by structuring the domain's core components. We begin by analyzing the fundamental challenges of fusing visual and linguistic information in charts. We then categorize downstream tasks and datasets, introducing a novel taxonomy of canonical and non-canonical benchmarks to highlight the field's expanding scope. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive evolution of methodologies, tracing the progression from classic deep learning techniques to state-of-the-art MLLM paradigms that leverage sophisticated fusion strategies. By critically examining the limitations of current models, particularly their perceptual and reasoning deficits, we identify promising future directions, including advanced alignment techniques and reinforcement learning for cognitive enhancement. This survey aims to equip researchers and practitioners with a structured understanding of how MLLMs are transforming chart information fusion and to catalyze progress toward more robust and reliable systems.

### [3] [MPA: Multimodal Prototype Augmentation for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10143)
*Liwen Wu,Wei Wang,Lei Zhao,Zhan Gao,Qika Lin,Shaowen Yao,Zuozhu Liu,Bin Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPA is a multimodal prototype augmentation framework for few-shot learning that enhances prototypes using LLM-generated semantic descriptions, hierarchical multi-view augmentations, and adaptive uncertain class absorption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot learning methods focus only on visual modality and compute prototypes directly from raw support images, lacking comprehensive multimodal information. This limits their ability to handle diverse real-world scenarios and uncertainty in few-shot settings.

Method: Proposes MPA framework with three components: 1) LLM-based Multi-Variant Semantic Enhancement (LMSE) generates diverse paraphrased category descriptions, 2) Hierarchical Multi-View Augmentation (HMA) applies natural and multi-view augmentations (viewing distance, camera angles, lighting), and 3) Adaptive Uncertain Class Absorber (AUCA) models uncertainty via interpolation and Gaussian sampling to absorb uncertain samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on four single-domain and six cross-domain FSL benchmarks show superior performance. MPA surpasses second-best method by 12.29% in single-domain and 24.56% in cross-domain settings for 5-way 1-shot tasks.

Conclusion: MPA effectively addresses limitations of unimodal few-shot learning by integrating multimodal information through semantic enhancement, view augmentation, and uncertainty modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse few-shot learning scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, few-shot learning (FSL) has become a popular task that aims to recognize new classes from only a few labeled examples and has been widely applied in fields such as natural science, remote sensing, and medical images. However, most existing methods focus only on the visual modality and compute prototypes directly from raw support images, which lack comprehensive and rich multimodal information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Prototype Augmentation FSL framework called MPA, including LLM-based Multi-Variant Semantic Enhancement (LMSE), Hierarchical Multi-View Augmentation (HMA), and an Adaptive Uncertain Class Absorber (AUCA). LMSE leverages large language models to generate diverse paraphrased category descriptions, enriching the support set with additional semantic cues. HMA exploits both natural and multi-view augmentations to enhance feature diversity (e.g., changes in viewing distance, camera angles, and lighting conditions). AUCA models uncertainty by introducing uncertain classes via interpolation and Gaussian sampling, effectively absorbing uncertain samples. Extensive experiments on four single-domain and six cross-domain FSL benchmarks demonstrate that MPA achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods across most settings. Notably, MPA surpasses the second-best method by 12.29% and 24.56% in the single-domain and cross-domain setting, respectively, in the 5-way 1-shot setting.

### [4] [VERA: Identifying and Leveraging Visual Evidence Retrieval Heads in Long-Context Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10146)
*Rongcan Pei,Huan Li,Fang Guo,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes long-context processing bottlenecks in Vision-Language Models, identifies critical Visual Evidence Retrieval Heads, and proposes VERA - a training-free framework that improves performance by verbalizing visual evidence when models are uncertain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models struggle with long context and complex reasoning tasks. The paper aims to understand the internal mechanisms behind these performance bottlenecks, particularly focusing on how VLMs process long contexts and retrieve visual evidence during reasoning.

Method: 1) Analyze attention mechanisms to identify Visual Evidence Retrieval (VER) Heads - sparse, dynamic attention heads critical for locating visual cues. 2) Demonstrate causality by showing performance degradation when masking VER heads. 3) Propose VERA framework that detects model uncertainty (entropy) to trigger explicit verbalization of visual evidence attended by VER heads.

Result: VERA significantly improves long-context understanding: average relative improvement of 21.3% on Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and 20.1% on GLM-4.1V-Thinking across five benchmarks. The framework is training-free and effectively addresses performance bottlenecks.

Conclusion: The paper successfully identifies VER heads as critical components for visual evidence retrieval in VLMs and proposes an effective, training-free solution (VERA) that leverages model uncertainty to improve long-context understanding through explicit verbalization of visual evidence.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in textual understanding, they face significant challenges when handling long context and complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we dissect the internal mechanisms governing long-context processing in VLMs to understand their performance bottlenecks. Through the lens of attention analysis, we identify specific Visual Evidence Retrieval (VER) Heads - a sparse, dynamic set of attention heads critical for locating visual cues during reasoning, distinct from static OCR heads. We demonstrate that these heads are causal to model performance; masking them leads to significant degradation. Leveraging this discovery, we propose VERA (Visual Evidence Retrieval Augmentation), a training-free framework that detects model uncertainty (i.e., entropy) to trigger the explicit verbalization of visual evidence attended by VER heads. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that VERA significantly improves long-context understanding of open-source VLMs: it yields an average relative improvement of 21.3% on Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and 20.1% on GLM-4.1V-Thinking across five benchmarks.

### [5] [Beyond Closed-Pool Video Retrieval: A Benchmark and Agent Framework for Real-World Video Search and Moment Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10159)
*Tao Yu,Yujia Yang,Haopeng Jin,Junhao Gong,Xinlong Chen,Yuxuan Zhou,Shanbin Zhang,Jiabing Yang,Xinming Wang,Hongzhu Yi,Ping Nie,Kai Zou,Zhang Zhang,Yan Huang,Liang Wang,Yeshani,Ruiwen Tao,Jin Ma,Haijin Liang,Jinwen Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RVMS-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating real-world video memory search with 1,440 samples across 20 categories, featuring hierarchical descriptions and verified human annotations, plus RACLO framework for simulating human recall-search-verify process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video retrieval benchmarks fail to reflect real-world searches characterized by fuzzy, multi-dimensional memories on the open web. Current benchmarks focus on matching precise descriptions to closed video pools, which doesn't capture the realistic challenges of searching for videos based on incomplete or vague memories.

Method: 1) RVMS-Bench: A comprehensive evaluation system with 1,440 samples spanning 20 diverse categories and four duration groups, sourced from real-world open-web videos. Uses hierarchical description framework (Global Impression, Key Moment, Temporal Context, Auditory Memory) to mimic realistic multi-dimensional search cues, with human-in-the-loop verification. 2) RACLO: An agentic framework employing abductive reasoning to simulate human "Recall-Search-Verify" cognitive process for addressing fuzzy memory search challenges.

Result: Experiments reveal that existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still demonstrate insufficient capabilities in real-world Video Retrieval and Moment Localization based on fuzzy memories. The benchmark exposes limitations of current models in handling realistic, unstructured search scenarios.

Conclusion: This work will facilitate the advancement of video retrieval robustness in real-world unstructured scenarios by providing a more realistic benchmark and cognitive framework for evaluating and improving video search systems based on fuzzy memories.

Abstract: Traditional video retrieval benchmarks focus on matching precise descriptions to closed video pools, failing to reflect real-world searches characterized by fuzzy, multi-dimensional memories on the open web. We present \textbf{RVMS-Bench}, a comprehensive system for evaluating real-world video memory search. It consists of \textbf{1,440 samples} spanning \textbf{20 diverse categories} and \textbf{four duration groups}, sourced from \textbf{real-world open-web videos}. RVMS-Bench utilizes a hierarchical description framework encompassing \textbf{Global Impression, Key Moment, Temporal Context, and Auditory Memory} to mimic realistic multi-dimensional search cues, with all samples strictly verified via a human-in-the-loop protocol. We further propose \textbf{RACLO}, an agentic framework that employs abductive reasoning to simulate the human ``Recall-Search-Verify'' cognitive process, effectively addressing the challenge of searching for videos via fuzzy memories in the real world. Experiments reveal that existing MLLMs still demonstrate insufficient capabilities in real-world Video Retrieval and Moment Localization based on fuzzy memories. We believe this work will facilitate the advancement of video retrieval robustness in real-world unstructured scenarios.

### [6] [AD$^2$: Analysis and Detection of Adversarial Threats in Visual Perception for End-to-End Autonomous Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10160)
*Ishan Sahu,Somnath Hazra,Somak Aditya,Soumyajit Dey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates adversarial robustness of autonomous driving systems under black-box attacks in CARLA, revealing severe vulnerabilities, and proposes a lightweight attention-based attack detector (AD²).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end autonomous driving systems have made significant progress but their adversarial robustness remains largely unexplored, raising valid safety concerns that need to be addressed.

Method: The authors conduct closed-loop evaluation of state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents (Transfuser and Interfuser) under three black-box adversarial threat models in CARLA: physics-based blur attacks via acoustic waves, electromagnetic interference attacks, and digital ghost object attacks. They also propose AD², a lightweight attack detection model based on attention mechanisms that capture spatial-temporal consistency.

Result: Experiments reveal severe vulnerabilities in advanced autonomous driving agents, with driving scores dropping by up to 99% in worst-case scenarios. The proposed AD² detector achieves superior detection capability and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches across multi-camera inputs on CARLA.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates critical security vulnerabilities in autonomous driving systems and provides a practical solution through an efficient attention-based attack detector, highlighting the urgent need for robust adversarial defense mechanisms in safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems have achieved significant progress, yet their adversarial robustness remains largely underexplored. In this work, we conduct a closed-loop evaluation of state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents under black-box adversarial threat models in CARLA. Specifically, we consider three representative attack vectors on the visual perception pipeline: (i) a physics-based blur attack induced by acoustic waves, (ii) an electromagnetic interference attack that distorts captured images, and (iii) a digital attack that adds ghost objects as carefully crafted bounded perturbations on images. Our experiments on two advanced agents, Transfuser and Interfuser, reveal severe vulnerabilities to such attacks, with driving scores dropping by up to 99% in the worst case, raising valid safety concerns. To help mitigate such threats, we further propose a lightweight Attack Detection model for Autonomous Driving systems (AD$^2$) based on attention mechanisms that capture spatial-temporal consistency. Comprehensive experiments across multi-camera inputs on CARLA show that our detector achieves superior detection capability and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches.

### [7] [ArtisanGS: Interactive Tools for Gaussian Splat Selection with AI and Human in the Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10173)
*Clement Fuji Tsang,Anita Hu,Or Perel,Carsten Kolve,Maria Shugrina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Interactive toolset for selecting and editing 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS) scenes with AI-driven 2D-to-3D selection propagation and manual tools for flexible segmentation and local editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting usable objects from in-the-wild 3DGS captures is challenging, and existing controllable editing techniques for 3DGS representations are limited. Most emerging techniques focus on automatic solutions or high-level editing, lacking interactive control.

Method: Proposes an interactive suite with: 1) Fast AI-driven method to propagate user-guided 2D selection masks to 3DGS selections, 2) Flexible manual selection and segmentation tools for binary segmentation of unstructured 3DGS scenes, 3) User-guided local editing approach leveraging a custom Video Diffusion Model.

Result: The toolset outperforms state-of-the-art Gaussian Splat selection methods and enables direct user control over AI-modifiable areas. Tools work for any in-the-wild capture without additional optimization.

Conclusion: Provides a practical interactive solution for 3DGS scene manipulation, bridging the gap between automatic methods and user control, enabling versatile segmentation and editing applications.

Abstract: Representation in the family of 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS) are growing into a viable alternative to traditional graphics for an expanding number of application, including recent techniques that facilitate physics simulation and animation. However, extracting usable objects from in-the-wild captures remains challenging and controllable editing techniques for this representation are limited. Unlike the bulk of emerging techniques, focused on automatic solutions or high-level editing, we introduce an interactive suite of tools centered around versatile Gaussian Splat selection and segmentation. We propose a fast AI-driven method to propagate user-guided 2D selection masks to 3DGS selections. This technique allows for user intervention in the case of errors and is further coupled with flexible manual selection and segmentation tools. These allow a user to achieve virtually any binary segmentation of an unstructured 3DGS scene. We evaluate our toolset against the state-of-the-art for Gaussian Splat selection and demonstrate their utility for downstream applications by developing a user-guided local editing approach, leveraging a custom Video Diffusion Model. With flexible selection tools, users have direct control over the areas that the AI can modify. Our selection and editing tools can be used for any in-the-wild capture without additional optimization.

### [8] [When the Prompt Becomes Visual: Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attacks for Large Image Editing Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10179)
*Jiacheng Hou,Yining Sun,Ruochong Jin,Haochen Han,Fangming Liu,Wai Kin Victor Chan,Alex Jinpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA) is the first visual-to-visual jailbreak attack that uses purely visual inputs (marks, arrows, etc.) to convey malicious instructions to image editing models, exposing new safety vulnerabilities in vision-prompt editing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from text-driven to vision-prompt editing in large image editing models introduces critical safety risks - the attack surface becomes visual. Current safety measures are insufficient for this new paradigm where malicious instructions can be embedded in visual inputs rather than text.

Method: Proposes Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA) that conveys malicious instructions through visual inputs. Also introduces IESBench, a safety-oriented benchmark for image editing models, and proposes a training-free defense based on introspective multimodal reasoning to mitigate vulnerabilities.

Result: VJA effectively compromises state-of-the-art commercial models, achieving attack success rates up to 80.9% on Nano Banana Pro and 70.1% on GPT-Image-1.5. The proposed defense substantially improves safety of poorly aligned models to commercial system levels without auxiliary guard models and with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: The work exposes new vulnerabilities in vision-prompt editing systems, provides both a benchmark (IESBench) and practical defense to advance safe and trustworthy modern image editing. Visual jailbreak attacks represent a significant emerging threat that requires new safety approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in large image editing models have shifted the paradigm from text-driven instructions to vision-prompt editing, where user intent is inferred directly from visual inputs such as marks, arrows, and visual-text prompts. While this paradigm greatly expands usability, it also introduces a critical and underexplored safety risk: the attack surface itself becomes visual. In this work, we propose Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA), the first visual-to-visual jailbreak attack that conveys malicious instructions purely through visual inputs. To systematically study this emerging threat, we introduce IESBench, a safety-oriented benchmark for image editing models. Extensive experiments on IESBench demonstrate that VJA effectively compromises state-of-the-art commercial models, achieving attack success rates of up to 80.9% on Nano Banana Pro and 70.1% on GPT-Image-1.5. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a training-free defense based on introspective multimodal reasoning, which substantially improves the safety of poorly aligned models to a level comparable with commercial systems, without auxiliary guard models and with negligible computational overhead. Our findings expose new vulnerabilities, provide both a benchmark and practical defense to advance safe and trustworthy modern image editing systems. Warning: This paper contains offensive images created by large image editing models.

### [9] [DEGMC: Denoising Diffusion Models Based on Riemannian Equivariant Group Morphological Convolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10221)
*El Hadji S. Diop,Thierno Fall,Mohamed Daoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces geometric key feature extraction and network equivariance to DDPMs using group morphological convolutions in Riemannian manifolds, improving performance on image datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two major issues in DDPMs: 1) geometric key feature extraction and 2) network equivariance. Current DDPMs using U-net architecture are only translation equivariant, lacking rotation, reflection, and permutation equivariance.

Method: Introduce group morphological convolutions in Riemannian manifolds derived from viscosity solutions of first-order Hamilton-Jacobi-type PDEs. Add convection term and solve using method of characteristics to capture nonlinearities, represent thin geometric structures, and incorporate symmetries.

Result: Experimental results on MNIST, RotoMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets show noticeable improvements compared to baseline DDPM model.

Conclusion: The proposed geometric approach with Euclidean group equivariance enhances DDPM performance by better capturing geometric features and incorporating symmetries through morphological PDE-based convolutions.

Abstract: In this work, we address two major issues in recent Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM): {\bf 1)} geometric key feature extraction and {\bf 2)} network equivariance. Since the DDPM prediction network relies on the U-net architecture, which is theoretically only translation equivariant, we introduce a geometric approach combined with an equivariance property of the more general Euclidean group, which includes rotations, reflections, and permutations. We introduce the notion of group morphological convolutions in Riemannian manifolds, which are derived from the viscosity solutions of first-order Hamilton-Jacobi-type partial differential equations (PDEs) that act as morphological multiscale dilations and erosions. We add a convection term to the model and solve it using the method of characteristics. This helps us better capture nonlinearities, represent thin geometric structures, and incorporate symmetries into the learning process. Experimental results on the MNIST, RotoMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets show noticeable improvements compared to the baseline DDPM model.

### [10] [XSPLAIN: XAI-enabling Splat-based Prototype Learning for Attribute-aware INterpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10239)
*Dominik Galus,Julia Farganus,Tymoteusz Zapala,Mikołaj Czachorowski,Piotr Borycki,Przemysław Spurek,Piotr Syga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XSPLAIN is the first ante-hoc, prototype-based interpretability framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting classification that provides intuitive explanations without degrading performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) lacks interpretability for classification tasks, hindering adoption in critical domains. Existing explainability methods for 3D representations rely on ambiguous saliency maps that fail to capture the volumetric coherence of Gaussian primitives.

Method: Uses a voxel-aggregated PointNet backbone with a novel invertible orthogonal transformation that disentangles feature channels for interpretability while preserving original decision boundaries. Explanations are grounded in representative training examples for intuitive "this looks like that" reasoning.

Result: User study (N=51) shows decisive preference: participants selected XSPLAIN explanations 48.4% of the time as best, significantly outperforming baselines (p<0.001). No degradation in classification performance.

Conclusion: XSPLAIN successfully addresses the interpretability gap in 3DGS classification, providing transparency and user trust through prototype-based explanations while maintaining classification accuracy.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly become a standard for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction, yet its adoption in multiple critical domains is hindered by the lack of interpretability of the generation models as well as classification of the Splats. While explainability methods exist for other 3D representations, like point clouds, they typically rely on ambiguous saliency maps that fail to capture the volumetric coherence of Gaussian primitives. We introduce XSPLAIN, the first ante-hoc, prototype-based interpretability framework designed specifically for 3DGS classification. Our approach leverages a voxel-aggregated PointNet backbone and a novel, invertible orthogonal transformation that disentangles feature channels for interpretability while strictly preserving the original decision boundaries. Explanations are grounded in representative training examples, enabling intuitive ``this looks like that'' reasoning without any degradation in classification performance. A rigorous user study (N=51) demonstrates a decisive preference for our approach: participants selected XSPLAIN explanations 48.4\% of the time as the best, significantly outperforming baselines $(p<0.001)$, showing that XSPLAIN provides transparency and user trust.

Benchmark established using 7 object detection models (Faster R-CNN, CenterNet, YOLOX, DETR, Deformable DETR, DINO, RT-DETR) and 3 tracking algorithms (ByteTrack, BOT-SORT, OC-SORT) implemented under MMDetection framework.

Result: YOLOX, Deformable DETR, and Faster R-CNN achieved the best detection performance. Differences among the three tracking algorithms (ByteTrack, BOT-SORT, OC-SORT) were relatively small. Dataset and code made publicly available.

Conclusion: The PMMA dataset fills an important gap in pedestrian detection research by focusing on mobility aid users. The benchmark results provide guidance for selecting appropriate detection models for this specific application, with YOLOX, Deformable DETR, and Faster R-CNN showing superior performance.

Abstract: This study introduces a new object detection dataset of pedestrians using mobility aids, named PMMA. The dataset was collected in an outdoor environment, where volunteers used wheelchairs, canes, and walkers, resulting in nine categories of pedestrians: pedestrians, cane users, two types of walker users, whether walking or resting, five types of wheelchair users, including wheelchair users, people pushing empty wheelchairs, and three types of users pushing occupied wheelchairs, including the entire pushing group, the pusher and the person seated on the wheelchair. To establish a benchmark, seven object detection models (Faster R-CNN, CenterNet, YOLOX, DETR, Deformable DETR, DINO, and RT-DETR) and three tracking algorithms (ByteTrack, BOT-SORT, and OC-SORT) were implemented under the MMDetection framework. Experimental results show that YOLOX, Deformable DETR, and Faster R-CNN achieve the best detection performance, while the differences among the three trackers are relatively small.

*Marin Benčević,Krešimir Romić,Ivana Hartmann Tolić,Irena Galić*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers developed neural networks to predict skin tone from dermatoscopic images to address fairness auditing gaps in AI dermatology models, validated against colorimeter measurements, and found significant underrepresentation of darker skin types in public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of reliable skin-tone annotations in public dermatoscopy datasets, which limits fairness auditing of neural-network-based diagnosis systems that show performance disparities across skin tones.

Method: Developed neural networks for Fitzpatrick skin type prediction via ordinal regression and Individual Typology Angle (ITA) via color regression, using in-person Fitzpatrick labels and colorimeter measurements as targets, with extensive pretraining on synthetic and real dermatoscopic/clinical images.

Result: Fitzpatrick model achieved agreement comparable to human crowdsourced annotations; ITA predictions showed high concordance with colorimeter-derived ITA, outperforming pixel-averaging approaches. Application to ISIC 2020 and MILK10k revealed fewer than 1% of subjects belong to Fitzpatrick types V and VI.

Conclusion: The released open-source tool enables rapid skin-tone annotation and bias auditing, providing the first dermatoscopic skin-tone estimation neural network validated against colorimeter measurements, supporting evidence of performance gaps across skin-tone groups.

Abstract: Neural-network-based diagnosis from dermatoscopic images is increasingly used for clinical decision support, yet studies report performance disparities across skin tones. Fairness auditing of these models is limited by the lack of reliable skin-tone annotations in public dermatoscopy datasets. We address this gap with neural networks that predict Fitzpatrick skin type via ordinal regression and the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) via color regression, using in-person Fitzpatrick labels and colorimeter measurements as targets. We further leverage extensive pretraining on synthetic and real dermatoscopic and clinical images. The Fitzpatrick model achieves agreement comparable to human crowdsourced annotations, and ITA predictions show high concordance with colorimeter-derived ITA, substantially outperforming pixel-averaging approaches. Applying these estimators to ISIC 2020 and MILK10k, we find that fewer than 1% of subjects belong to Fitzpatrick types V and VI. We release code and pretrained models as an open-source tool for rapid skin-tone annotation and bias auditing. This is, to our knowledge, the first dermatoscopic skin-tone estimation neural network validated against colorimeter measurements, and it supports growing evidence of clinically relevant performance gaps across skin-tone groups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-image 3D reconstruction is ill-posed due to missing geometric/textural information in occluded regions. Existing methods use synthesized auxiliary views for supervision, but these views contain inconsistencies and misalignments that propagate artifacts during reconstruction.

Method: Proposes ERGO framework that decomposes optimization losses in 3D Gaussian splatting into excess risk (suboptimality gap) and Bayes error (irreducible noise). Dynamically estimates view-specific excess risk and adaptively adjusts loss weights. Introduces geometry-aware and texture-aware objectives for synergistic global-local optimization.

Result: ERGO demonstrates robustness against supervision noise while consistently enhancing both geometric fidelity and textural quality. Extensive experiments on Google Scanned Objects and OmniObject3D datasets show superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ERGO effectively handles imperfect supervisory signals from synthesized views through adaptive optimization guided by excess risk decomposition, leading to improved 3D reconstruction quality from single images.

Abstract: Generating 3D content from a single image remains a fundamentally challenging and ill-posed problem due to the inherent absence of geometric and textural information in occluded regions. While state-of-the-art generative models can synthesize auxiliary views to provide additional supervision, these views inevitably contain geometric inconsistencies and textural misalignments that propagate and amplify artifacts during 3D reconstruction. To effectively harness these imperfect supervisory signals, we propose an adaptive optimization framework guided by excess risk decomposition, termed ERGO. Specifically, ERGO decomposes the optimization losses in 3D Gaussian splatting into two components, i.e., excess risk that quantifies the suboptimality gap between current and optimal parameters, and Bayes error that models the irreducible noise inherent in synthesized views. This decomposition enables ERGO to dynamically estimate the view-specific excess risk and adaptively adjust loss weights during optimization. Furthermore, we introduce geometry-aware and texture-aware objectives that complement the excess-risk-derived weighting mechanism, establishing a synergistic global-local optimization paradigm. Consequently, ERGO demonstrates robustness against supervision noise while consistently enhancing both geometric fidelity and textural quality of the reconstructed 3D content. Extensive experiments on the Google Scanned Objects dataset and the OmniObject3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of ERGO over existing state-of-the-art methods.

*Jiaxuan Zhu,Siyu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRD is a low-rank defense method that protects Latent Diffusion Models from adversarial attacks by merging LoRA modules with a balance parameter to detect and defend adversarial samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As adversarial attacks on diffusion models and their fine-tuning processes rapidly develop, there's a critical need for defensive strategies to prevent abuse and ensure practical application of diffusion models.

Method: Proposes Low-Rank Defense (LoRD) that introduces merging idea and balance parameter combined with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules to detect and defend adversarial samples. Builds a defense pipeline applying learned LoRD modules to help diffusion models defend against attacks.

Result: Extensive experiments on facial and landscape images show significantly better defense performance compared to baseline methods. Ensures LDM fine-tuned on both adversarial and clean samples can still generate high-quality images.

Conclusion: LoRD provides an efficient defensive strategy against adversarial attacks on Latent Diffusion Models, demonstrating superior defense performance while maintaining image generation quality.

Abstract: Recently, adversarial attacks for diffusion models as well as their fine-tuning process have been developed rapidly. To prevent the abuse of these attack algorithms from affecting the practical application of diffusion models, it is critical to develop corresponding defensive strategies. In this work, we propose an efficient defensive strategy, named Low-Rank Defense (LoRD), to defend the adversarial attack on Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). LoRD introduces the merging idea and a balance parameter, combined with the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules, to detect and defend the adversarial samples. Based on LoRD, we build up a defense pipeline that applies the learned LoRD modules to help diffusion models defend against attack algorithms. Our method ensures that the LDM fine-tuned on both adversarial and clean samples can still generate high-quality images. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on facial and landscape images, and our method shows significantly better defense performance compared to the baseline methods.

### [15] [Enhancing Underwater Images via Adaptive Semantic-aware Codebook Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10586)
*Bosen Lin,Feng Gao,Yanwei Yu,Junyu Dong,Qian Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SUCode is a semantic-aware underwater image enhancement method that uses pixel-level codebook representation to address inconsistent degradation across different scene components, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater Image Enhancement is ill-posed with no natural clean references, and existing methods fail because they use single global models that ignore inconsistent degradation across different semantic regions, leading to color distortions and loss of fine details in heterogeneous underwater scenes.

Method: SUCode uses semantic-aware discrete codebook representation with pixel-level adaptation for heterogeneous underwater degradation. It employs a three-stage training paradigm to avoid pseudo ground-truth contamination, and integrates Gated Channel Attention Module (GCAM) and Frequency-Aware Feature Fusion (FAFF) for color restoration and texture recovery.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show SUCode achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent UIE methods on both reference and no-reference metrics.

Conclusion: SUCode effectively addresses the inconsistent degradation problem in underwater images through semantic-aware codebook representation, providing superior enhancement results compared to existing methods that use global models.

Abstract: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) is an ill-posed problem where natural clean references are not available, and the degradation levels vary significantly across semantic regions. Existing UIE methods treat images with a single global model and ignore the inconsistent degradation of different scene components. This oversight leads to significant color distortions and loss of fine details in heterogeneous underwater scenes, especially where degradation varies significantly across different image regions. Therefore, we propose SUCode (Semantic-aware Underwater Codebook Network), which achieves adaptive UIE from semantic-aware discrete codebook representation. Compared with one-shot codebook-based methods, SUCode exploits semantic-aware, pixel-level codebook representation tailored to heterogeneous underwater degradation. A three-stage training paradigm is employed to represent raw underwater image features to avoid pseudo ground-truth contamination. Gated Channel Attention Module (GCAM) and Frequency-Aware Feature Fusion (FAFF) jointly integrate channel and frequency cues for faithful color restoration and texture recovery. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SUCode achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent UIE methods on both reference and no-reference metrics. The code will be made public available at https://github.com/oucailab/SUCode.

*Juyeop Han,Lukas Lao Beyer,Sertac Karaman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UA-Flow adds uncertainty estimation to flow matching models to assess sample reliability and improve generation quality through uncertainty-guided sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite success of sampling-based generative models like flow matching, they can still produce inconsistent or degraded quality samples. Need to assess sample reliability and generate higher-quality outputs.

Method: Proposes UA-Flow, a lightweight extension of flow matching that predicts velocity field with heteroscedastic uncertainty. Estimates per-sample uncertainty by propagating velocity uncertainty through flow dynamics, then uses uncertainty for classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance.

Result: UA-Flow produces uncertainty signals more highly correlated with sample fidelity than baseline methods, and uncertainty-guided sampling further improves generation quality in image generation experiments.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware flow matching effectively assesses sample reliability and improves generation quality through uncertainty-guided sampling techniques.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of sampling-based generative models such as flow matching, they can still produce samples of inconsistent or degraded quality. To assess sample reliability and generate higher-quality outputs, we propose uncertainty-aware flow matching (UA-Flow), a lightweight extension of flow matching that predicts the velocity field together with heteroscedastic uncertainty. UA-Flow estimates per-sample uncertainty by propagating velocity uncertainty through the flow dynamics. These uncertainty estimates act as a reliability signal for individual samples, and we further use them to steer generation via uncertainty-aware classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance. Experiments on image generation show that UA-Flow produces uncertainty signals more highly correlated with sample fidelity than baseline methods, and that uncertainty-guided sampling further improves generation quality.

### [17] [Conditional Uncertainty-Aware Political Deepfake Detection with Stochastic Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10343)
*Rafael-Petruţ Gardoş*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates uncertainty-aware political deepfake detection using stochastic CNNs, evaluating uncertainty through observable criteria rather than purely Bayesian constructs to enable risk-aware moderation in high-stakes political contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Political deepfakes pose serious risks to information integrity and democratic processes. Current deepfake detectors only provide point predictions without reliability indicators, which is operationally critical in high-stakes political contexts where unreliable outputs could have severe consequences.

Method: The study uses stochastic convolutional neural networks within an empirical, decision-oriented reliability framework. A politically focused binary image dataset is constructed via metadata filtering from a large public real-synthetic corpus. Two pretrained CNN backbones (ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B4) are fine-tuned and compared using deterministic inference, single-pass stochastic prediction, Monte Carlo dropout, temperature scaling, and ensemble-based uncertainty surrogates.

Result: Results show that calibrated probabilistic outputs and uncertainty estimates enable risk-aware moderation policies. The systematic confidence-band analysis clarifies when uncertainty provides operational value beyond predicted confidence, delineating both benefits and limitations of uncertainty-aware deepfake detection in political settings.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware deepfake detection provides valuable operational benefits for political contexts by enabling risk-aware moderation policies, though the study also delineates limitations of such approaches and clarifies when uncertainty estimates provide meaningful value beyond simple confidence scores.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative image models have enabled the creation of highly realistic political deepfakes, posing risks to information integrity, public trust, and democratic processes. While automated deepfake detectors are increasingly deployed in moderation and investigative pipelines, most existing systems provide only point predictions and fail to indicate when outputs are unreliable, being an operationally critical limitation in high-stakes political contexts. This work investigates conditional, uncertainty-aware political deepfake detection using stochastic convolutional neural networks within an empirical, decision-oriented reliability framework. Rather than treating uncertainty as a purely Bayesian construct, it is evaluated through observable criteria, including calibration quality, proper scoring rules, and its alignment with prediction errors under both global and confidence-conditioned analyses. A politically focused binary image dataset is constructed via deterministic metadata filtering from a large public real-synthetic corpus. Two pretrained CNN backbones (ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B4) are fully fine-tuned for classification. Deterministic inference is compared with single-pass stochastic prediction, Monte Carlo dropout with multiple forward passes, temperature scaling, and ensemble-based uncertainty surrogates. Evaluation reports ROC-AUC, thresholded confusion matrices, calibration metrics, and generator-disjoint out-of-distribution performance. Results demonstrate that calibrated probabilistic outputs and uncertainty estimates enable risk-aware moderation policies. A systematic confidence-band analysis further clarifies when uncertainty provides operational value beyond predicted confidence, delineating both the benefits and limitations of uncertainty-aware deepfake detection in political settings.

### [18] [Monte Carlo Maximum Likelihood Reconstruction for Digital Holography with Speckle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10344)
*Xi Chen,Arian Maleki,Shirin Jalali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGD-MC enables scalable maximum likelihood estimation for digital holography with finite apertures using randomized linear algebra to avoid costly matrix inversions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is theoretically sound for speckle mitigation in coherent imaging but computationally prohibitive for high-resolution digital holography with accurate aperture modeling due to high-dimensional matrix inversion costs.

Method: Proposed PGD-MC (projected gradient descent with Monte Carlo estimation) uses randomized linear algebra and conjugate gradient methods to compute likelihood gradients without explicit matrix inversions, enabling accurate aperture modeling.

Result: PGD-MC demonstrates robustness to diverse aperture models, achieves substantial improvements in reconstruction quality and computational efficiency, and scales effectively to high-resolution digital holography, outperforming prior methods in both accuracy and speed.

Conclusion: PGD-MC provides a flexible and effective MLE-based reconstruction framework for digital holography with finite apertures, overcoming computational barriers that previously prevented accurate aperture modeling in speckle mitigation.

Abstract: In coherent imaging, speckle is statistically modeled as multiplicative noise, posing a fundamental challenge for image reconstruction. While maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) provides a principled framework for speckle mitigation, its application to coherent imaging system such as digital holography with finite apertures is hindered by the prohibitive cost of high-dimensional matrix inversion, especially at high resolutions. This computational burden has prevented the use of MLE-based reconstruction with physically accurate aperture modeling. In this work, we propose a randomized linear algebra approach that enables scalable MLE optimization without explicit matrix inversions in gradient computation. By exploiting the structural properties of sensing matrix and using conjugate gradient for likelihood gradient evaluation, the proposed algorithm supports accurate aperture modeling without the simplifying assumptions commonly imposed for tractability. We term the resulting method projected gradient descent with Monte Carlo estimation (PGD-MC). The proposed PGD-MC framework (i) demonstrates robustness to diverse and physically accurate aperture models, (ii) achieves substantial improvements in reconstruction quality and computational efficiency, and (iii) scales effectively to high-resolution digital holography. Extensive experiments incorporating three representative denoisers as regularization show that PGD-MC provides a flexible and effective MLE-based reconstruction framework for digital holography with finite apertures, consistently outperforming prior Plug-and-Play model-based iterative reconstruction methods in both accuracy and speed.

TL;DR: Researchers developed and validated two fully open-sourced, FDA-cleared deep learning pipelines (AAQ and BMD) for opportunistic CT analysis, showing clinical-grade accuracy while improving transparency and accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous validation in open-source medical imaging tools and lack of transparency in commercial solutions, which leads to unexpected failures in clinical deployment.

Method: Developed two deep learning pipelines within Comp2Comp package: AAQ for abdominal aortic aneurysm segmentation and BMD for vertebral bone density estimation. Both were FDA-510(k)-cleared and validated on external datasets from multiple institutions.

Result: AAQ achieved mean absolute error of 1.57mm for aortic diameter measurements compared to radiologist ground truth. BMD achieved 81.0% sensitivity and 78.4% specificity for low vs normal bone density classification compared to DXA ground truth.

Conclusion: Comp2Comp AAQ and BMD demonstrated sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Open-sourcing these FDA-cleared algorithms improves transparency, allows pre-deployment testing, and provides researchers with high-quality methods.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence allows automatic extraction of imaging biomarkers from already-acquired radiologic images. This paradigm of opportunistic imaging adds value to medical imaging without additional imaging costs or patient radiation exposure. However, many open-source image analysis solutions lack rigorous validation while commercial solutions lack transparency, leading to unexpected failures when deployed. Here, we report development and validation for two of the first fully open-sourced, FDA-510(k)-cleared deep learning pipelines to mitigate both challenges: Abdominal Aortic Quantification (AAQ) and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) estimation are both offered within the Comp2Comp package for opportunistic analysis of computed tomography scans. AAQ segments the abdominal aorta to assess aneurysm size; BMD segments vertebral bodies to estimate trabecular bone density and osteoporosis risk. AAQ-derived maximal aortic diameters were compared against radiologist ground-truth measurements on 258 patient scans enriched for abdominal aortic aneurysms from four external institutions. BMD binary classifications (low vs. normal bone density) were compared against concurrent DXA scan ground truths obtained on 371 patient scans from four external institutions. AAQ had an overall mean absolute error of 1.57 mm (95% CI 1.38-1.80 mm). BMD had a sensitivity of 81.0% (95% CI 74.0-86.8%) and specificity of 78.4% (95% CI 72.3-83.7%). Comp2Comp AAQ and BMD demonstrated sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Open-sourcing these algorithms improves transparency of typically opaque FDA clearance processes, allows hospitals to test the algorithms before cumbersome clinical pilots, and provides researchers with best-in-class methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs suffer from language bias hallucinations; authors create Hallucination-Inducing Images to reveal scene-conditioned patterns, build MOH benchmark, and use HIIs for alignment to reduce hallucinations by 38%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models have language bias that causes hallucinations, but existing mitigation methods don't address the underlying hallucination patterns driven by this bias.

Method: 1) Design pipeline to synthesize Hallucination-Inducing Images (HIIs); 2) Use HIIs to identify scene-conditioned hallucination patterns; 3) Create Masked-Object-Hallucination benchmark; 4) Use HIIs to construct preference datasets for fine-grained alignment.

Result: Method achieves up to 38% improvement over state-of-the-art on standard hallucination benchmarks while preserving general model capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach effectively mitigates hallucinations by addressing language bias patterns through synthesized HIIs and fine-grained alignment, significantly improving VLM reliability.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse multimodal tasks but remain vulnerable to hallucinations rooted in inherent language bias. Despite recent progress, existing hallucination mitigation methods often overlook the underlying hallucination patterns driven by language bias. In this work, we design a novel pipeline to accurately synthesize Hallucination-Inducing Images (HIIs). Using synthesized HIIs, we reveal a consistent scene-conditioned hallucination pattern: models tend to mention objects that are highly typical of the scene even when visual evidence is removed. To quantify the susceptibility of VLMs to this hallucination pattern, we establish the Masked-Object-Hallucination (MOH) benchmark to rigorously evaluate existing state-of-the-art alignment frameworks. Finally, we leverage HIIs to construct high-quality preference datasets for fine-grained alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates hallucinations while preserving general model capabilities. Specifically, our method achieves up to a 38% improvement over the current state-of-the-art on standard hallucination benchmarks.

Conclusion: ChangeTitans effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by combining Titans architecture with specialized vision components, achieving superior change detection performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and related applications. However, current methods often struggle to capture long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. Although Transformers can effectively model global context, their quadratic complexity poses scalability challenges, and existing linear attention approaches frequently fail to capture intricate spatiotemporal relationships. Drawing inspiration from the recent success of Titans in language tasks, we present ChangeTitans, the Titans-based framework for remote sensing change detection. Specifically, we propose VTitans, the first Titans-based vision backbone that integrates neural memory with segmented local attention, thereby capturing long-range dependencies while mitigating computational overhead. Next, we present a hierarchical VTitans-Adapter to refine multi-scale features across different network layers. Finally, we introduce TS-CBAM, a two-stream fusion module leveraging cross-temporal attention to suppress pseudo-changes and enhance detection accuracy. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, LEVIR-CD+, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate that ChangeTitans achieves state-of-the-art results, attaining \textbf{84.36\%} IoU and \textbf{91.52\%} F1-score on LEVIR-CD, while remaining computationally competitive.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper provides a physical systems analysis of Multi-Resolution Hash Encoding (MHE), characterizing its spatial behavior through Point Spread Function analysis, revealing grid-induced anisotropy and optimization-driven resolution broadening, and proposing Rotated MHE to mitigate anisotropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHE lacks rigorous physical understanding, leading to heuristic hyperparameter selection. The authors aim to establish a principled analytical framework to characterize MHE's spatial behavior and optimize its performance.

Method: Analytical approach examining MHE's Point Spread Function (analogous to Green's function), deriving closed-form approximation for collision-free PSF, analyzing spatial resolution/fidelity, studying finite hash capacity effects, and proposing Rotated MHE with distinct input coordinate rotations per resolution level.

Result: Reveals grid-induced anisotropy and logarithmic spatial profile in MHE; shows effective resolution governed by average resolution (Navg) rather than finest resolution (Nmax) due to optimization broadening; demonstrates hash collisions cause speckle noise and SNR degradation; Rotated MHE mitigates anisotropy while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: Establishes physics-based methodology for MHE characterization, moving beyond heuristics. Provides theoretical insights into spatial behavior and optimization dynamics, with practical improvements through Rotated MHE architecture.

Abstract: Multi-Resolution Hash Encoding (MHE), the foundational technique behind Instant Neural Graphics Primitives, provides a powerful parameterization for neural fields. However, its spatial behavior lacks rigorous understanding from a physical systems perspective, leading to reliance on heuristics for hyperparameter selection. This work introduces a novel analytical approach that characterizes MHE by examining its Point Spread Function (PSF), which is analogous to the Green's function of the system. This methodology enables a quantification of the encoding's spatial resolution and fidelity. We derive a closed-form approximation for the collision-free PSF, uncovering inherent grid-induced anisotropy and a logarithmic spatial profile. We establish that the idealized spatial bandwidth, specifically the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), is determined by the average resolution, $N_{\text{avg}}$. This leads to a counterintuitive finding: the effective resolution of the model is governed by the broadened empirical FWHM (and therefore $N_{\text{avg}}$), rather than the finest resolution $N_{\max}$, a broadening effect we demonstrate arises from optimization dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of finite hash capacity, demonstrating how collisions introduce speckle noise and degrade the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose Rotated MHE (R-MHE), an architecture that applies distinct rotations to the input coordinates at each resolution level. R-MHE mitigates anisotropy while maintaining the efficiency and parameter count of the original MHE. This study establishes a methodology based on physical principles that moves beyond heuristics to characterize and optimize MHE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern segmentation models achieve strong performance but remain opaque, limiting our ability to diagnose failures, understand dataset shift, or intervene in a principled manner.

Method: Uses sparse autoencoders trained on SegFormer and U-Net to decompose model activations into interpretable latent features, with cross-architecture and cross-dataset latent alignment across diverse glioma cohorts.

Result: Identifies stable shared representations and dataset shift driven by population-specific latents. Latents act as causal bottlenecks for failures, and targeted interventions can correct errors and improve cross-dataset adaptation without retraining, recovering 70% of failure cases and improving Dice score from 39.4% to 74.2%.

Conclusion: Latent-level model diffing provides a practical and mechanistic tool for diagnosing failures and mitigating dataset shift in segmentation models.

Abstract: Modern segmentation models achieve strong predictive performance but remain largely opaque, limiting our ability to diagnose failures, understand dataset shift, or intervene in a principled manner. We introduce Med-SegLens, a model-diffing framework that decomposes segmentation model activations into interpretable latent features using sparse autoencoders trained on SegFormer and U-Net. Through cross-architecture and cross-dataset latent alignment across healthy, adult, pediatric, and sub-Saharan African glioma cohorts, we identify a stable backbone of shared representations, while dataset shift is driven by differential reliance on population-specific latents. We show that these latents act as causal bottlenecks for segmentation failures, and that targeted latent-level interventions can correct errors and improve cross-dataset adaption without retraining, recovering performance in 70% of failure cases and improving Dice score from 39.4% to 74.2%. Our results demonstrate that latent-level model diffing provides a practical and mechanistic tool for diagnosing failures and mitigating dataset shift in segmentation models.

TL;DR: CoLin introduces a novel low-rank complex adapter with only 1% parameters that outperforms full fine-tuning and classical delta-tuning for vision foundation models across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of vision foundation models is prohibitively expensive and inefficient, while existing delta-tuning methods effective for LLMs don't transfer well to vision models, creating a need for more efficient adaptation strategies.

Method: Proposes CoLin (Complex Linear Projection Optimization) with a novel low-rank complex adapter architecture and a tailored loss function to address convergence issues in low-rank composite matrices during training.

Result: Extensive experiments on object detection, segmentation, image classification, and rotated object detection show CoLin outperforms both full fine-tuning and classical delta-tuning approaches with only 1% parameters.

Conclusion: CoLin provides a novel and efficient solution for deploying vision foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: Deploying vision foundation models typically relies on efficient adaptation strategies, whereas conventional full fine-tuning suffers from prohibitive costs and low efficiency. While delta-tuning has proven effective in boosting the performance and efficiency of LLMs during adaptation, its advantages cannot be directly transferred to the fine-tuning pipeline of vision foundation models. To push the boundaries of adaptation efficiency for vision tasks, we propose an adapter with Complex Linear Projection Optimization (CoLin). For architecture, we design a novel low-rank complex adapter that introduces only about 1% parameters to the backbone. For efficiency, we theoretically prove that low-rank composite matrices suffer from severe convergence issues during training, and address this challenge with a tailored loss. Extensive experiments on object detection, segmentation, image classification, and rotated object detection (remote sensing scenario) demonstrate that CoLin outperforms both full fine-tuning and classical delta-tuning approaches with merely 1% parameters for the first time, providing a novel and efficient solution for deployment of vision foundation models. We release the code on https://github.com/DongshuoYin/CoLin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DXTalker is an expressive 3D talking avatar system that addresses data scarcity, limited audio representations, and controllability challenges through data curation, enriched audio features, and spatial dynamics control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio-driven 3D talking avatar generation faces challenges due to insufficient training data with limited identities, narrow audio representations, and restricted explicit controllability, making it difficult to achieve comprehensive expressivity including identity preservation, lip synchronization, emotional expression, and spatial dynamics.

Method: Proposes 3DXTalker with three key components: 1) Data-curated identity modeling using 2D-to-3D data curation pipeline and disentangled representations for scalable identity modeling; 2) Audio-rich representations including frame-wise amplitude and emotional cues beyond standard speech embeddings; 3) Spatial dynamics controllability with flow-matching-based transformer for coherent facial dynamics and prompt-based conditioning for stylized head-pose control.

Result: Extensive experiments show that 3DXTalker successfully integrates lip synchronization, emotional expression, and head-pose dynamics within a unified framework, achieving superior performance in 3D talking avatar generation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 3DXTalker provides a comprehensive solution for expressive 3D talking avatar generation by addressing key limitations in data availability, audio representation richness, and controllability, enabling more lifelike and controllable virtual communication avatars.

Abstract: Audio-driven 3D talking avatar generation is increasingly important in virtual communication, digital humans, and interactive media, where avatars must preserve identity, synchronize lip motion with speech, express emotion, and exhibit lifelike spatial dynamics, collectively defining a broader objective of expressivity. However, achieving this remains challenging due to insufficient training data with limited subject identities, narrow audio representations, and restricted explicit controllability. In this paper, we propose 3DXTalker, an expressive 3D talking avatar through data-curated identity modeling, audio-rich representations, and spatial dynamics controllability. 3DXTalker enables scalable identity modeling via 2D-to-3D data curation pipeline and disentangled representations, alleviating data scarcity and improving identity generalization. Then, we introduce frame-wise amplitude and emotional cues beyond standard speech embeddings, ensuring superior lip synchronization and nuanced expression modulation. These cues are unified by a flow-matching-based transformer for coherent facial dynamics. Moreover, 3DXTalker also enables natural head-pose motion generation while supporting stylized control via prompt-based conditioning. Extensive experiments show that 3DXTalker integrates lip synchronization, emotional expression, and head-pose dynamics within a unified framework, achieves superior performance in 3D talking avatar generation.

*Sharat Bhat,Harshita Khandelwal,Tushar Kataria,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapVerse is a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multimodal reasoning on real-world maps, revealing current VLMs struggle with complex spatial reasoning despite performing well on classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM benchmarks for map-based reasoning are limited in scope, domain-specific, and rely on artificial content, lacking depth for evaluating genuine geospatial reasoning capabilities.

Method: Created MapVerse benchmark with 11,837 human-authored QA pairs across 1,025 real-world maps spanning 10 diverse categories, then evaluated 10 state-of-the-art models with fine-grained categorical analysis.

Result: Current VLMs perform competitively on classification tasks but both open- and closed-source models fall short on advanced tasks requiring complex spatial reasoning, revealing significant reasoning gaps.

Conclusion: MapVerse provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating genuine geospatial reasoning, highlighting the need for improved multimodal models that can handle complex spatial relationships and real-world map interpretation.

Abstract: Maps are powerful carriers of structured and contextual knowledge, encompassing geography, demographics, infrastructure, and environmental patterns. Reasoning over such knowledge requires models to integrate spatial relationships, visual cues, real-world context, and domain-specific expertise-capabilities that current large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle to exhibit consistently. Yet, datasets used to benchmark VLMs on map-based reasoning remain narrow in scope, restricted to specific domains, and heavily reliant on artificially generated content (outputs from LLMs or pipeline-based methods), offering limited depth for evaluating genuine geospatial reasoning. To address this gap, we present MapVerse, a large-scale benchmark built on real-world maps. It comprises 11,837 human-authored question-answer pairs across 1,025 maps, spanning ten diverse map categories and multiple question categories for each. The dataset provides a rich setting for evaluating map reading, interpretation, and multimodal reasoning. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art models against our benchmark to establish baselines and quantify reasoning gaps. Beyond overall performance, we conduct fine-grained categorical analyses to assess model inference across multiple dimensions and investigate the visual factors shaping reasoning outcomes. Our findings reveal that while current VLMs perform competitively on classification-style tasks, both open- and closed-source models fall short on advanced tasks requiring complex spatial reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A high-quality, large-scale dataset of 730k+ images (real and AI-generated) with rich metadata addresses limitations of existing datasets and improves generalization for AI-generated image detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about AI-generated image authenticity by overcoming limitations of existing datasets: poor generalization, low quality, simple prompts, and insufficient diversity.

Method: Created dataset with 730k+ images using state-of-the-art generation methods (text-to-image, inpainting, refinement, face swapping) guided by 10k+ carefully designed prompts. Also proposed lightweight detection method using image noise entropy transformed into NLM noise entropy tensor.

Result: Detection models trained on the dataset show superior generalization. The proposed noise entropy method delivers competitive performance, establishing a solid baseline for future research.

Conclusion: The dataset serves as a strong benchmark for evaluating detection methods and advances robustness of AI-generated image detection. Public availability of dataset and code supports further research.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has raised concerns about the authenticity of digital images, as highly realistic fake images can now be generated at low cost, potentially increasing societal risks. In response, several datasets have been established to train detection models aimed at distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones. However, existing datasets suffer from limited generalization, low image quality, overly simple prompts, and insufficient image diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a high-quality, large-scale dataset comprising over 730,000 images across multiple categories, including both real and AI-generated images. The generated images are synthesized via state-of-the-art methods, including text-to-image generation (guided by over 10,000 carefully designed prompts), image inpainting, image refinement, and face swapping. Each generated image is annotated with its generation method and category. Inpainting images further include binary masks to indicate inpainted regions, providing rich metadata for analysis. Compared to existing datasets, detection models trained on our dataset demonstrate superior generalization capabilities. Our dataset not only serves as a strong benchmark for evaluating detection methods but also contributes to advancing the robustness of AI-generated image detection techniques. Building upon this, we propose a lightweight detection method based on image noise entropy, which transforms the original image into an entropy tensor of Non-Local Means (NLM) noise before classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on our dataset achieve strong generalization, and our method delivers competitive performance, establishing a solid baseline for future research. The dataset and source code are publicly available at https://real-hd.github.io.

*Shengyang Sun,Jiashen Hua,Junyi Feng,Xiaojin Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel text-guided framework for multimodal video anomaly detection that uses in-context learning for text augmentation and multi-scale bottleneck Transformer fusion to address modality redundancy and imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text modality is under-explored in video anomaly detection despite providing explicit semantic information that could enhance anomaly characterization and reduce false alarms. Challenges include: general-purpose language models can't capture anomaly-specific nuances, scarcity of relevant text descriptions, and multimodal fusion suffers from redundancy and imbalance.

Method: 1) In-context learning-based multi-stage text augmentation mechanism to generate high-quality anomaly text samples for fine-tuning text feature extractor. 2) Multi-scale bottleneck Transformer fusion module that uses compressed bottleneck tokens to progressively integrate information across modalities, mitigating redundancy and imbalance.

Result: Experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed text-guided framework effectively leverages text modality for video anomaly detection by addressing text feature extraction challenges and multimodal fusion issues, achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Weakly supervised multimodal video anomaly detection has gained significant attention, yet the potential of the text modality remains under-explored. Text provides explicit semantic information that can enhance anomaly characterization and reduce false alarms. However, extracting effective text features is challenging due to the inability of general-purpose language models to capture anomaly-specific nuances and the scarcity of relevant descriptions. Furthermore, multimodal fusion often suffers from redundancy and imbalance. To address these issues, we propose a novel text-guided framework. First, we introduce an in-context learning-based multi-stage text augmentation mechanism to generate high-quality anomaly text samples for fine-tuning the text feature extractor. Second, we design a multi-scale bottleneck Transformer fusion module that uses compressed bottleneck tokens to progressively integrate information across modalities, mitigating redundancy and imbalance. Experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C²RoPE: Improved Rotary Position Embedding that models spatial continuity and causal relationships for 3D multimodal models, addressing limitations of standard RoPE in visual processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RoPE has limitations for multimodal processing: (1) applying 1D temporal positional indices disrupts visual feature continuity along column dimension, causing spatial locality loss; (2) RoPE's temporal proximity assumption leads to long-term decay in attention allocation, causing models to progressively neglect earlier visual tokens as sequence length increases.

Method: C²RoPE introduces spatio-temporal continuous positional embedding: (1) integrates 1D temporal positions with Cartesian-based spatial coordinates to create triplet hybrid positional index; (2) uses frequency allocation strategy to encode spatio-temporal positional information across three index components; (3) introduces Chebyshev Causal Masking that determines causal dependencies by computing Chebyshev distance of image tokens in 2D space.

Result: Evaluation across various benchmarks including 3D scene reasoning and 3D visual question answering demonstrates C²RoPE's effectiveness in improving 3D multimodal model performance.

Conclusion: C²RoPE successfully addresses RoPE's limitations for visual processing by explicitly modeling local spatial continuity and spatial causal relationships, providing a better positional embedding mechanism for 3D Large Multimodal Models.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) have established the alignment of 3D visual features with LLM representations as the dominant paradigm. However, the inherited Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduces limitations for multimodal processing. Specifically, applying 1D temporal positional indices disrupts the continuity of visual features along the column dimension, resulting in spatial locality loss. Moreover, RoPE follows the prior that temporally closer image tokens are more causally related, leading to long-term decay in attention allocation and causing the model to progressively neglect earlier visual tokens as the sequence length increases. To address these issues, we propose C^2RoPE, an improved RoPE that explicitly models local spatial Continuity and spatial Causal relationships for visual processing. C^2RoPE introduces a spatio-temporal continuous positional embedding mechanism for visual tokens. It first integrates 1D temporal positions with Cartesian-based spatial coordinates to construct a triplet hybrid positional index, and then employs a frequency allocation strategy to encode spatio-temporal positional information across the three index components. Additionally, we introduce Chebyshev Causal Masking, which determines causal dependencies by computing the Chebyshev distance of image tokens in 2D space. Evaluation results across various benchmarks, including 3D scene reasoning and 3D visual question answering, demonstrate C^2RoPE's effectiveness.

TL;DR: MetaphorStar is a visual RL framework that significantly improves AI's ability to understand metaphorical and implied meanings in images, achieving SOTA performance on image implication benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with metaphorical comprehension in images due to lack of sophisticated multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind capabilities needed for understanding nuanced implications.

Method: Proposes MetaphorStar framework with three components: TFQ-Data (fine-grained dataset), TFQ-GRPO (visual reinforcement learning method), and TFQ-Bench (structured benchmark). Uses end-to-end visual RL for image implication tasks.

Result: MetaphorStar-32B achieves SOTA on multiple-choice and open-style questions, outperforms Gemini-3.0-pro on true-false questions, with average 82.6% improvement on benchmarks. Training improves general visual reasoning ability.

Conclusion: MetaphorStar successfully addresses the challenge of metaphorical comprehension in images through visual RL, demonstrating broad applicability and providing open-source resources for further research.

Abstract: Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for Nowadays AI systems. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at basic Visual Question Answering (VQA), they consistently struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional, and contextual implications embedded in visual content. This difficulty stems from the task's demand for sophisticated multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities, which current models lack. To fill this gap, we propose MetaphorStar, the first end-to-end visual reinforcement learning (RL) framework for image implication tasks. Our framework includes three core components: the fine-grained dataset TFQ-Data, the visual RL method TFQ-GRPO, and the well-structured benchmark TFQ-Bench.
  Our fully open-source MetaphorStar family, trained using TFQ-GRPO on TFQ-Data, significantly improves performance by an average of 82.6% on the image implication benchmarks. Compared with 20+ mainstream MLLMs, MetaphorStar-32B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on Multiple-Choice Question and Open-Style Question, significantly outperforms the top closed-source model Gemini-3.0-pro on True-False Question. Crucially, our experiments reveal that learning image implication tasks improves the general understanding ability, especially the complex visual reasoning ability. We further provide a systematic analysis of model parameter scaling, training data scaling, and the impact of different model architectures and training strategies, demonstrating the broad applicability of our method. We open-sourced all model weights, datasets, and method code at https://metaphorstar.github.io.

Conclusion: Proposes a deployment-ready, lightweight solution for child detection in challenging surveillance conditions that improves accuracy while maintaining edge device compatibility, making it suitable for low-cost industrial surveillance deployments.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical and lightweight solution for enhancing child detection in low-quality surveillance footage, a critical component in real-world missing child alert and daycare monitoring systems. Building upon the efficient YOLOv11n architecture, we propose a deployment-ready pipeline that improves detection under challenging conditions including occlusion, small object size, low resolution, motion blur, and poor lighting commonly found in existing CCTV infrastructures. Our approach introduces a domain-specific augmentation strategy that synthesizes realistic child placements using spatial perturbations such as partial visibility, truncation, and overlaps, combined with photometric degradations including lighting variation and noise. To improve recall of small and partially occluded instances, we integrate Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) at inference time. All components are trained and evaluated on a filtered, child-only subset of the Roboflow Daycare dataset. Compared to the baseline YOLOv11n, our enhanced system achieves a mean Average Precision at 0.5 IoU (mAP@0.5) of 0.967 and a mean Average Precision averaged over IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 (mAP@0.5:0.95) of 0.783, yielding absolute improvements of 0.7 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, without architectural changes. Importantly, the entire pipeline maintains compatibility with low-power edge devices and supports real-time performance, making it particularly well suited for low-cost or resource-constrained industrial surveillance deployments.

TL;DR: VRFT-Aug is a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework for medical imaging that combines perception augmentation and reasoning enhancement strategies to outperform standard fine-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) methods are limited to text domains and haven't been effectively extended to vision-centric medical imaging, which requires both robust visual perception and structured reasoning for effective performance.

Method: VRFT-Aug introduces a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework with four key strategies: prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation to stabilize and improve the RFT process.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms both standard supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines across multiple medical datasets, providing empirically grounded insights and practical training heuristics.

Conclusion: This work contributes actionable guidance and fresh inspiration for developing reliable, reasoning-capable models for high-stakes medical applications, with methods that can generalize to other medical image tasks.

Abstract: While recent advances in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) have shown that rule-based reward schemes can enable effective post-training for large language models, their extension to cross-modal, vision-centric domains remains largely underexplored. This limitation is especially pronounced in the medical imaging domain, where effective performance requires both robust visual perception and structured reasoning. In this work, we address this gap by proposing VRFT-Aug, a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for the medical domain. VRFT-Aug introduces a series of training strategies designed to augment both perception and reasoning, including prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation. Together, these methods aim to stabilize and improve the RFT process.
  Through extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets, we show that our approaches consistently outperform both standard supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines. Moreover, we provide empirically grounded insights and practical training heuristics that can be generalized to other medical image tasks. We hope this work contributes actionable guidance and fresh inspiration for the ongoing effort to develop reliable, reasoning-capable models for high-stakes medical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical foundation models show promise but face deployment challenges due to reliance on task-specific fine-tuning. The authors aim to develop a dermatology model that can provide effective clinical decision support without requiring adaptation for specific tasks.

Method: Trained DermFM-Zero via masked latent modelling and contrastive learning on over 4 million multimodal data points. Evaluated across 20 benchmarks for zero-shot diagnosis and multimodal retrieval, and conducted three multinational reader studies involving over 1,100 clinicians.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance without task-specific adaptation. In clinical studies: 1) AI assistance nearly doubled GPs' diagnostic accuracy across 98 skin conditions, 2) outperformed board-certified dermatologists in skin cancer assessment, 3) enabled non-experts to surpass unassisted experts. Latent representations are interpretable and enable bias suppression.

Conclusion: DermFM-Zero demonstrates that foundation models can provide effective, safe, and transparent zero-shot clinical decision support, overcoming the fine-tuning barrier that hinders widespread deployment of medical AI systems.

Abstract: Medical foundation models have shown promise in controlled benchmarks, yet widespread deployment remains hindered by reliance on task-specific fine-tuning. Here, we introduce DermFM-Zero, a dermatology vision-language foundation model trained via masked latent modelling and contrastive learning on over 4 million multimodal data points. We evaluated DermFM-Zero across 20 benchmarks spanning zero-shot diagnosis and multimodal retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific adaptation. We further evaluated its zero-shot capabilities in three multinational reader studies involving over 1,100 clinicians. In primary care settings, AI assistance enabled general practitioners to nearly double their differential diagnostic accuracy across 98 skin conditions. In specialist settings, the model significantly outperformed board-certified dermatologists in multimodal skin cancer assessment. In collaborative workflows, AI assistance enabled non-experts to surpass unassisted experts while improving management appropriateness. Finally, we show that DermFM-Zero's latent representations are interpretable: sparse autoencoders unsupervisedly disentangle clinically meaningful concepts that outperform predefined-vocabulary approaches and enable targeted suppression of artifact-induced biases, enhancing robustness without retraining. These findings demonstrate that a foundation model can provide effective, safe, and transparent zero-shot clinical decision support.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenDR-Pix accelerates diffusion-based super-resolution by eliminating the VAE bottleneck through pixel-shuffle operations and multi-stage adversarial distillation, achieving 2.8x speedup and 60% memory reduction while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for super-resolution suffer from slow inference and high memory demands, limiting their ability to process high-resolution images without tiling. The VAE component is identified as the main bottleneck for both latency and memory usage.

Method: 1) Replace VAE with pixel-(un)shuffle operations to move from latent-space to pixel-space processing (GenDR-Pix). 2) Multi-stage adversarial distillation to progressively remove encoder/decoder while avoiding artifacts. 3) Random padding for feature augmentation and discriminator stability. 4) Masked Fourier space loss to penalize amplitude outliers. 5) Padding-based self-ensemble with classifier-free guidance for improved inference scaling.

Result: GenDR-Pix achieves 2.8x acceleration and 60% memory saving compared to GenDR with negligible visual degradation. It can restore 4K images in just 1 second using only 6GB memory, outperforming other one-step diffusion SR methods.

Conclusion: By eliminating the VAE bottleneck through pixel-space processing and advanced distillation techniques, GenDR-Pix significantly improves the practicality of diffusion-based super-resolution for real-world applications, enabling efficient high-resolution image restoration.

Abstract: Diffusion models have attained remarkable breakthroughs in the real-world super-resolution (SR) task, albeit at slow inference and high demand on devices. To accelerate inference, recent works like GenDR adopt step distillation to minimize the step number to one. However, the memory boundary still restricts the maximum processing size, necessitating tile-by-tile restoration of high-resolution images. Through profiling the pipeline, we pinpoint that the variational auto-encoder (VAE) is the bottleneck of latency and memory. To completely solve the problem, we leverage pixel-(un)shuffle operations to eliminate the VAE, reversing the latent-based GenDR to pixel-space GenDR-Pix. However, upscale with x8 pixelshuffle may induce artifacts of repeated patterns. To alleviate the distortion, we propose a multi-stage adversarial distillation to progressively remove the encoder and decoder. Specifically, we utilize generative features from the previous stage models to guide adversarial discrimination. Moreover, we propose random padding to augment generative features and avoid discriminator collapse. We also introduce a masked Fourier space loss to penalize the outliers of amplitude. To improve inference performance, we empirically integrate a padding-based self-ensemble with classifier-free guidance to improve inference scaling. Experimental results show that GenDR-Pix performs 2.8x acceleration and 60% memory-saving compared to GenDR with negligible visual degradation, surpassing other one-step diffusion SR. Against all odds, GenDR-Pix can restore 4K image in only 1 second and 6GB.

TL;DR: VideoSTF is a new benchmark framework that systematically measures and stress-tests output repetition failures in VideoLLMs, revealing widespread repetitive degeneration issues that can be exploited via simple temporal transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoLLMs show strong performance but suffer from underexplored generation failures - severe output repetition where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops. Existing benchmarks focus on accuracy and factual correctness but miss this stability issue.

Method: VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos with a library of controlled temporal transformations. The framework enables pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across VideoLLMs.

Result: Output repetition is widespread across 10 advanced VideoLLMs and highly sensitive to temporal perturbations. Simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in black-box settings, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability.

Conclusion: Output repetition is a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs, motivating stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems. The VideoSTF framework provides tools to systematically measure and address this problem.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently achieved strong performance in video understanding tasks. However, we identify a previously underexplored generation failure: severe output repetition, where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases or sentences. This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems.

Abstract: We address the challenging task of text-driven 3D human-object interaction (HOI) motion generation. Existing methods primarily rely on a direct text-to-HOI mapping, which suffers from three key limitations due to the significant cross-modality gap: (Q1) sub-optimal human motion, (Q2) unnatural object motion, and (Q3) weak interaction between humans and objects. To address these challenges, we propose MP-HOI, a novel framework grounded in four core insights: (1) Multimodal Data Priors: We leverage multimodal data (text, image, pose/object) from large multimodal models as priors to guide HOI generation, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in data modeling. (2) Enhanced Object Representation: We improve existing object representations by incorporating geometric keypoints, contact features, and dynamic properties, enabling expressive object representations, which tackles Q2 in data representation. (3) Multimodal-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Model: We propose a modality-aware MoE model for effective multimodal feature fusion paradigm, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in feature fusion. (4) Cascaded Diffusion with Interaction Supervision: We design a cascaded diffusion framework that progressively refines human-object interaction features under dedicated supervision, which tackles Q3 in interaction refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MP-HOI outperforms existing approaches in generating high-fidelity and fine-grained HOI motions.

*Minglei Li,Mengfan He,Chao Chen,Ziyang Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: (MGS)² is a geometry-grounded framework for cross-view geo-localization that addresses geometric misalignment between oblique aerial and orthographic satellite views through macro-structure filtering and micro-scale adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view geo-localization is crucial for GNSS-denied UAV navigation but suffers from brittleness due to drastic geometric misalignment between oblique aerial views and orthographic satellite references. Existing 2D methods neglect underlying 3D geometry where view-dependent vertical facades and scale variations corrupt feature alignment.

Method: Proposes (MGS)² with three key components: 1) Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module uses dilated geometric gradients to filter facade artifacts while enhancing view-invariant horizontal plane; 2) Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module utilizes depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion; 3) Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss to discriminate against oblique occlusions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with Recall@1 of 97.5% on University-1652 and 97.02% on SUES-200. Demonstrates superior cross-dataset generalization against geometric ambiguity.

Conclusion: The geometry-grounded (MGS)² framework effectively addresses geometric misalignment in cross-view geo-localization by explicitly modeling 3D structure and scale variations, achieving robust performance and generalization for UAV navigation applications.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) is pivotal for GNSS-denied UAV navigation but remains brittle under the drastic geometric misalignment between oblique aerial views and orthographic satellite references. Existing methods predominantly operate within a 2D manifold, neglecting the underlying 3D geometry where view-dependent vertical facades (macro-structure) and scale variations (micro-scale) severely corrupt feature alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose (MGS)$^2$, a geometry-grounded framework. The core of our innovation is the Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module. Unlike pixel-wise matching sensitive to noise, MGSF leverages dilated geometric gradients to physically filter out high-frequency facade artifacts while enhancing the view-invariant horizontal plane, directly addressing the domain shift. To guarantee robust input for this structural filtering, we explicitly incorporate a Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module. MGSA utilizes depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion. Furthermore, a Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss is designed to strictly discriminate against oblique occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (MGS)$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, recording a Recall@1 of 97.5\% on University-1652 and 97.02\% on SUES-200. Furthermore, the framework exhibits superior cross-dataset generalization against geometric ambiguity.

*Tiandong Shi,Ling Zhao,Ji Qi,Jiayi Ma,Chengli Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free frequency modulation method for text-guided diffusion models that preserves structure while enabling semantic modifications by analyzing and manipulating frequency components in noisy latent variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided diffusion models suffer from unintended global structure changes when modifying text prompts to achieve semantic adjustments. Current methods rely on empirical feature map selection, leading to suboptimal stability and performance dependency on appropriate selection.

Method: Analyzes frequency spectrum of noisy latent variables and their impact on structure framework and texture generation. Proposes training-free frequency modulation using frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay that directly manipulates noisy latent variables, avoiding empirical feature map selection.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving effective balance between preserving structure and enabling semantic updates.

Conclusion: Frequency perspective provides effective solution to structure preservation in text-guided diffusion models, with proposed training-free method offering stable performance without empirical feature map selection dependencies.

Abstract: The success of text-guided diffusion models has established a new image generation paradigm driven by the iterative refinement of text prompts. However, modifying the original text prompt to achieve the expected semantic adjustments often results in unintended global structure changes that disrupt user intent. Existing methods rely on empirical feature map selection for intervention, whose performance heavily depends on appropriate selection, leading to suboptimal stability. This paper tries to solve the aforementioned problem from a frequency perspective and analyzes the impact of the frequency spectrum of noisy latent variables on the hierarchical emergence of the structure framework and fine-grained textures during the generation process. We find that lower-frequency components are primarily responsible for establishing the structure framework in the early generation stage. Their influence diminishes over time, giving way to higher-frequency components that synthesize fine-grained textures. In light of this, we propose a training-free frequency modulation method utilizing a frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay. This method maintains the structure framework consistency while permitting targeted semantic modifications. By directly manipulating the noisy latent variable, the proposed method avoids the empirical selection of internal feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving an effective balance between preserving structure and enabling semantic updates.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM evaluations are vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception and reasoning from a cyclist's perspective, despite cyclists facing safety-critical situations in urban traffic.

Method: Introduce CyclingVQA diagnostic benchmark to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from cyclist perspective. Evaluate 31+ recent VLMs including general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models.

Result: Current models show encouraging capabilities but clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, especially interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with correct navigational lanes. Driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training.

Conclusion: Systematic error analysis identifies recurring failure modes to guide development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems, highlighting need for cyclist-centric evaluation and improvement in VLM capabilities.

Abstract: Cyclists often encounter safety-critical situations in urban traffic, highlighting the need for assistive systems that support safe and informed decision-making. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, suggesting their potential for general traffic understanding and navigation-related reasoning. However, existing evaluations are predominantly vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception and reasoning from a cyclist-centric viewpoint. To address this gap, we introduce CyclingVQA, a diagnostic benchmark designed to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from a cyclist's perspective. Evaluating 31+ recent VLMs spanning general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models, we find that current models demonstrate encouraging capabilities, while also revealing clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, particularly in interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with the correct navigational lanes. Notably, several driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios. Finally, through systematic error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes to guide the development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems.

Conclusion: The work successfully bridges the gap in temporal reasoning for VCoT by introducing large-scale temporally grounded datasets and a unified model that effectively handles dynamic visual question answering through iterative visual reasoning.

Abstract: Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing multimodal reasoning by integrating visual perception into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing VCoT approaches are largely confined to static scenarios and struggle to capture the temporal dynamics essential for tasks such as instruction, prediction, and camera motion. To bridge this gap, we propose TwiFF-2.7M, the first large-scale, temporally grounded VCoT dataset derived from $2.7$ million video clips, explicitly designed for dynamic visual question and answer. Accompanying this, we introduce TwiFF-Bench, a high-quality evaluation benchmark of $1,078$ samples that assesses both the plausibility of reasoning trajectories and the correctness of final answers in open-ended dynamic settings. Building on these foundations, we propose the TwiFF model, a unified modal that synergistically leverages pre-trained video generation and image comprehension capabilities to produce temporally coherent visual reasoning cues-iteratively generating future action frames and textual reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TwiFF significantly outperforms existing VCoT methods and Textual Chain-of-Thought baselines on dynamic reasoning tasks, which fully validates the effectiveness for visual question answering in dynamic scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forgery detection methods are limited to uni-modal or bi-modal settings, failing to handle interleaved text, images, and videos in real-world misinformation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the difficulty bias problem in omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding, achieving superior performance and generalization capabilities through balanced reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Existing forgery detection methods are often limited to uni-modal or bi-modal settings, failing to handle the interleaved text, images, and videos prevalent in real-world misinformation. To bridge this gap, this paper targets to develop a unified framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. In this unified setting, the {interplay} between diverse modalities and the dual requirements of simultaneous detection and localization pose a critical ``difficulty bias`` problem: the simpler veracity classification task tends to dominate the gradients, leading to suboptimal performance in fine-grained grounding during multi-task optimization. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{OmniVL-Guard}, a balanced reinforcement learning framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. Particularly, OmniVL-Guard comprises two core designs: Self-Evolving CoT Generatio and Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO). {Self-Evolving CoT Generation} synthesizes high-quality reasoning paths, effectively overcoming the cold-start challenge. Building upon this, {Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO)} dynamically modulates reward scales and task weights, ensuring a balanced joint optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PP-DNN improves autonomous vehicle perception by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest to reduce computational load while maintaining accuracy, achieving predictable real-time inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles face challenges in achieving real-time DNN inference due to the gap between computational requirements and limited onboard resources. Existing approaches focus on model compression, but this paper addresses the problem by reducing the amount of image data to process.

Method: PP-DNN uses an ROI generator to identify critical frames and regions based on frame similarities and traffic scenarios, a FLOPs predictor to estimate computational requirements, an ROI scheduler to coordinate multiple DNN models, and a detection predictor for non-critical frames.

Result: PP-DNN significantly improves perception predictability: increases fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reduces fusion delay by >2.6x, reduces delay variations by >2.3x, improves detection completeness by 75.4%, and enhances cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over baseline.

Conclusion: PP-DNN provides a novel approach to predictable perception in autonomous vehicles by dynamically selecting critical data for processing, enabling real-time inference while maintaining accuracy and significantly improving system performance metrics.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sensors and deep neural networks (DNNs) to perceive their surrounding environment and make maneuver decisions in real time. However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.

Motivation: Existing VLA models primarily rely on 2D image-trained VLMs, which limits their spatial understanding and action grounding in complex 3D environments. There's a need to bridge the gap between 2D observations and 3D-aware decision-making in robotics.

Method: 1) Use VGGT depth estimation baseline to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from RGB inputs, enabling use of existing 2D datasets while recovering 3D structure. 2) Introduce action assistant module to constrain learned 3D representations with action priors for consistency with control tasks. 3) Fuse enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. It strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios and leads to superior action prediction accuracy compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Depth-driven data augmentation and auxiliary expert supervision can effectively bridge the gap between 2D observations and 3D-aware decision-making in robotic systems, highlighting the potential of integrating depth estimation into VLA frameworks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic perception and control, yet most existing approaches primarily rely on VLM trained using 2D images, which limits their spatial understanding and action grounding in complex 3D environments. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy. This work highlights the potential of depth-driven data augmentation and auxiliary expert supervision for bridging the gap between 2D observations and 3D-aware decision-making in robotic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing oriented object detection methods lack explicit foreground modeling and don't leverage geometric orientation priors, limiting feature discriminability for cluttered backgrounds, scale variation, and orientation changes in remote sensing imagery.

Method: Proposes FGAA-FPN with hierarchical functional decomposition: 1) Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation module learns foreground saliency under weak supervision to enhance object regions in low-level features; 2) Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention module encodes relative orientation relationships to guide global interactions in high-level semantic features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on DOTA v1.0 (75.5% mAP) and DOTA v1.5 (68.3% mAP), demonstrating superior performance for oriented object detection in remote sensing.

Conclusion: FGAA-FPN effectively addresses key challenges in oriented object detection through explicit foreground modeling and geometric orientation priors, providing a robust solution for geographic information updating, maritime surveillance, and disaster response applications.

Abstract: With the increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing and aerial imagery, oriented object detection has become a key capability for geographic information updating, maritime surveillance, and disaster response. However, it remains challenging due to cluttered backgrounds, severe scale variation, and large orientation changes. Existing approaches largely improve performance through multi-scale feature fusion with feature pyramid networks or contextual modeling with attention, but they often lack explicit foreground modeling and do not leverage geometric orientation priors, which limits feature discriminability. To overcome these limitations, we propose FGAA-FPN, a Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for oriented object detection. FGAA-FPN is built on a hierarchical functional decomposition that accounts for the distinct spatial resolution and semantic abstraction across pyramid levels, thereby strengthening multi-scale representations. Concretely, a Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation module learns foreground saliency under weak supervision to enhance object regions and suppress background interference in low-level features. In parallel, an Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention module encodes relative orientation relationships to guide global interactions among high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on DOTA v1.0 and DOTA v1.5 demonstrate that FGAA-FPN achieves state-of-the-art results, reaching 75.5% and 68.3% mAP, respectively.

However, the utility of GFMs has not been fully explored for high-value use cases. This study aims to explore the utility, challenges and opportunities associated with the application of GFMs for ecological uses. In this regard, we fine-tune several pretrained AI models, namely, Prithvi-E0-2.0 and TerraMind, across three use cases, and compare this with a baseline ResNet-101 model. Firstly, we demonstrate TerraMind's LULC generation capabilities. Lastly, we explore the utility of the GFMs in forest functional trait mapping and peatlands detection. In all experiments, the GFMs outperform the baseline ResNet models. In general TerraMind marginally outperforms Prithvi. However, with additional modalities TerraMind significantly outperforms the baseline ResNet and Prithvi models. Nonetheless, consideration should be given to the divergence of input data from pretrained modalities. We note that these models would benefit from higher resolution and more accurate labels, especially for use cases where pixel-level dynamics need to be mapped.

### [52] [A Diffusion-Based Generative Prior Approach to Sparse-view Computed Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10722)
*Davide Evangelista,Pasquale Cascarano,Elena Loli Piccolomini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes modifications to Deep Generative Prior (DGP) framework using diffusion models for CT reconstruction from sparse/limited-angle sinograms, improving reconstruction quality while maintaining explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT reconstruction from sparse or limited-angle geometries is challenging due to data insufficiency causing artifacts and object distortions. Deep generative models show great potential, and the DGP framework combines diffusion models with iterative optimization to maintain explainability while leveraging neural network generative power.

Method: The paper modifies the Deep Generative Prior (DGP) framework by combining diffusion-based generative models with iterative optimization algorithms for CT reconstruction. It proposes improvements in three aspects: image generation, the model itself, and the iterative algorithm used to solve the minimization problem.

Result: The results are very promising even under highly sparse geometries, showing improved reconstruction quality compared to existing approaches, though further research is needed.

Conclusion: The proposed modifications to the DGP framework using diffusion models effectively improve CT reconstruction from sparse/limited-angle sinograms, maintaining explainability while enhancing generative capabilities. The approach shows promise but requires further investigation.

Abstract: The reconstruction of X-rays CT images from sparse or limited-angle geometries is a highly challenging task. The lack of data typically results in artifacts in the reconstructed image and may even lead to object distortions. For this reason, the use of deep generative models in this context has great interest and potential success. In the Deep Generative Prior (DGP) framework, the use of diffusion-based generative models is combined with an iterative optimization algorithm for the reconstruction of CT images from sinograms acquired under sparse geometries, to maintain the explainability of a model-based approach while introducing the generative power of a neural network. There are therefore several aspects that can be further investigated within these frameworks to improve reconstruction quality, such as image generation, the model, and the iterative algorithm used to solve the minimization problem, for which we propose modifications with respect to existing approaches. The results obtained even under highly sparse geometries are very promising, although further research is clearly needed in this direction.

*Xinhao Xiang,Zhengxin Li,Saurav Dhakad,Theo Bancroft,Jiawei Zhang,Weiyang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OccFace: An occlusion-aware facial landmark detection framework that predicts both landmark coordinates and per-point visibility for universal human-like faces, improving robustness under occlusion and large head rotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing facial landmark detectors struggle with occlusion, especially for human-like faces with large appearance variation and rotation-driven self-occlusion. They typically handle occlusion implicitly without predicting per-point visibility that downstream applications could benefit from.

Method: OccFace uses a unified dense 100-point layout with heatmap-based backbone, adding an occlusion module that jointly predicts landmark coordinates and per-point visibility by combining local evidence with cross-landmark context. Visibility supervision mixes manual labels with landmark-aware masking that derives pseudo visibility from mask-heatmap overlap.

Result: Experiments show improved robustness under external occlusion and large head rotations, especially on occluded regions, while preserving accuracy on visible landmarks. The framework works for humans, stylized characters, and other non-human designs.

Conclusion: OccFace provides an effective occlusion-aware solution for facial landmark detection that explicitly predicts visibility, enabling better performance under challenging occlusion scenarios and benefiting downstream applications.

Abstract: Accurate facial landmark detection under occlusion remains challenging, especially for human-like faces with large appearance variation and rotation-driven self-occlusion. Existing detectors typically localize landmarks while handling occlusion implicitly, without predicting per-point visibility that downstream applications can benefits. We present OccFace, an occlusion-aware framework for universal human-like faces, including humans, stylized characters, and other non-human designs. OccFace adopts a unified dense 100-point layout and a heatmap-based backbone, and adds an occlusion module that jointly predicts landmark coordinates and per-point visibility by combining local evidence with cross-landmark context. Visibility supervision mixes manual labels with landmark-aware masking that derives pseudo visibility from mask-heatmap overlap. We also create an occlusion-aware evaluation suite reporting NME on visible vs. occluded landmarks and benchmarking visibility with Occ AP, F1@0.5, and ROC-AUC, together with a dataset annotated with 100-point landmarks and per-point visibility. Experiments show improved robustness under external occlusion and large head rotations, especially on occluded regions, while preserving accuracy on visible landmarks.

TL;DR: S3 RIQA: A no-reference super-resolution image quality assessment method using self-supervised contrastive learning to handle real-world SR degradations by learning SR-model-specific representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world super-resolution suffers from complex, unpredictable degradations that differ from synthetic scenarios, making quality assessment challenging. Existing methods struggle with these ill-posed realistic settings, especially in data-scarce domains.

Method: Proposes S3 RIQA with self-supervised contrastive learning: pretrains multiple SR model representations by forming positive pairs from same SR model outputs and negative pairs from different models. Includes targeted preprocessing for complementary quality information and auxiliary tasks for handling different scaling factor degradations. Uses new SRMORSS dataset for unsupervised pretext training.

Result: S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art relevant metrics on real SR-IQA benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness for domain-adaptive quality assessment in real-world SR applications.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenging problem of real-world SR-IQA by learning SR-algorithm-dependent degradations through self-supervised contrastive learning, enabling better quality assessment in data-scarce domains with unpredictable real-world degradations.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) applied to real-world low-resolution (LR) images often results in complex, irregular degradations that stem from the inherent complexity of natural scene acquisition. In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets. Experiments on real SR-IQA benchmarks demonstrate that S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art relevant metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel method for generating vector residential plans from text descriptions, plus algorithm for vectorizing raster plans, both achieving improved CLIPScore metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vector graphics provide scalability without quality loss but are complex to produce, while raster graphics are easier but not scalable. For design/architecture, vector graphics' versatility is crucial despite computational demands.

Method: Introduces two main approaches: 1) A novel method for generating vector residential plans directly from textual descriptions, and 2) A new algorithm for vectorizing raster plans into structured vector images.

Result: The text-to-vector method surpasses existing solutions by ~5% in CLIPScore-based visual quality, benefiting from inherent handling of right angles and flexible settings. The vectorization algorithm produces vector images with ~4% better CLIPscore compared to others.

Conclusion: The paper presents effective solutions for generating and converting architectural plans to vector format, addressing the complexity of vector graphics production while maintaining scalability advantages over raster graphics.

Abstract: Computer graphics, comprising both raster and vector components, is a fundamental part of modern science, industry, and digital communication. While raster graphics offer ease of use, its pixel-based structure limits scalability. Vector graphics, defined by mathematical primitives, provides scalability without quality loss, however, it is more complex to produce. For design and architecture, the versatility of vector graphics is paramount, despite its computational demands. This paper introduces a novel method for generating vector residential plans from textual descriptions. Our approach surpasses existing solutions by approximately 5% in CLIPScore-based visual quality, benefiting from its inherent handling of right angles and flexible settings. Additionally, we present a new algorithm for vectorizing raster plans into structured vector images. Such images have a better CLIPscore compared to others by about 4%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DE-CM improves consistency models by addressing training instability and sampling inflexibility through dual-end optimization and noise-to-noisy mapping, achieving SOTA 1.70 FID on ImageNet 256x256 with one-step generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consistency models (CMs) face two major limitations for large-scale deployment: training instability due to loss divergence from unstable self-supervised terms, and sampling inflexibility caused by error accumulation. Existing solutions overlook the critical role of trajectory selection in addressing these issues.

Method: Proposes Dual-End Consistency Model (DE-CM) that selects vital sub-trajectory clusters for stable training. Decomposes PF-ODE trajectory and selects three critical sub-trajectories as optimization targets. Uses continuous-time CM objectives for few-step distillation and flow matching as boundary regularizer. Introduces novel noise-to-noisy (N2N) mapping that maps noise to any point to alleviate first-step error accumulation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art FID score of 1.70 in one-step generation on ImageNet 256x256 dataset, outperforming existing CM-based one-step approaches.

Conclusion: DE-CM successfully addresses key limitations of consistency models through trajectory decomposition and dual-end optimization, enabling stable training and flexible sampling while achieving superior one-step generation performance.

Abstract: The slow iterative sampling nature remains a major bottleneck for the practical deployment of diffusion and flow-based generative models. While consistency models (CMs) represent a state-of-the-art distillation-based approach for efficient generation, their large-scale application is still limited by two key issues: training instability and inflexible sampling. Existing methods seek to mitigate these problems through architectural adjustments or regularized objectives, yet overlook the critical reliance on trajectory selection. In this work, we first conduct an analysis on these two limitations: training instability originates from loss divergence induced by unstable self-supervised term, whereas sampling inflexibility arises from error accumulation. Based on these insights and analysis, we propose the Dual-End Consistency Model (DE-CM) that selects vital sub-trajectory clusters to achieve stable and effective training. DE-CM decomposes the PF-ODE trajectory and selects three critical sub-trajectories as optimization targets. Specifically, our approach leverages continuous-time CMs objectives to achieve few-step distillation and utilizes flow matching as a boundary regularizer to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, we propose a novel noise-to-noisy (N2N) mapping that can map noise to any point, thereby alleviating the error accumulation in the first step. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our method: it achieves a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.70 in one-step generation on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset, outperforming existing CM-based one-step approaches.

TL;DR: RSHallu is a systematic study addressing hallucinations in remote sensing multimodal LLMs, featuring a taxonomy, benchmark dataset, and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in multimodal LLMs for remote sensing hinder deployment in high-stakes applications like emergency management and agricultural monitoring, and remain under-explored in RS domain.

Method: 1) Formalized RS hallucinations with RS-oriented taxonomy including image-level inconsistencies; 2) Built RSHalluEval benchmark (2,023 QA pairs) with dual-mode checking; 3) Created RSHalluShield dataset (30k QA pairs) for mitigation and proposed training-free plug-and-play strategies including decoding-time logit correction and RS-aware prompting.

Result: Mitigation strategies improve hallucination-free rate by up to 21.63 percentage points across representative RS-MLLMs while maintaining competitive performance on downstream RS tasks (RSVQA/RSVG).

Conclusion: RSHallu provides a comprehensive framework for understanding, evaluating, and mitigating hallucinations in remote sensing multimodal LLMs, enabling more reliable deployment in critical applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly adopted in remote sensing (RS) and have shown strong performance on tasks such as RS visual grounding (RSVG), RS visual question answering (RSVQA), and multimodal dialogue. However, hallucinations, which are responses inconsistent with the input RS images, severely hinder their deployment in high-stakes scenarios (e.g., emergency management and agricultural monitoring) and remain under-explored in RS. In this work, we present RSHallu, a systematic study with three deliverables: (1) we formalize RS hallucinations with an RS-oriented taxonomy and introduce image-level hallucination to capture RS-specific inconsistencies beyond object-centric errors (e.g., modality, resolution, and scene-level semantics); (2) we build a hallucination benchmark RSHalluEval (2,023 QA pairs) and enable dual-mode checking, supporting high-precision cloud auditing and low-cost reproducible local checking via a compact checker fine-tuned on RSHalluCheck dataset (15,396 QA pairs); and (3) we introduce a domain-tailored dataset RSHalluShield (30k QA pairs) for training-friendly mitigation and further propose training-free plug-and-play strategies, including decoding-time logit correction and RS-aware prompting. Across representative RS-MLLMs, our mitigation improves the hallucination-free rate by up to 21.63 percentage points under a unified protocol, while maintaining competitive performance on downstream RS tasks (RSVQA/RSVG). Code and datasets will be released.

Motivation: Existing 3D anomaly detection methods require category-specific training, which limits flexibility in few-shot scenarios where only a few normal examples are available.

Method: Converts point clouds into fixed set of realistic depth images, uses frozen CLIP visual encoder to extract multi-view representations, performs anomaly detection via weighted feature similarity without any fine-tuning or category-dependent adaptation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ShapeNetPart dataset under few-shot setting, demonstrating effectiveness for practical cross-category 3D anomaly detection.

Conclusion: Proposes a simple yet effective training-free solution for cross-category 3D anomaly detection that eliminates need for category-specific training while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Cross-category anomaly detection for 3D point clouds aims to determine whether an unseen object belongs to a target category using only a few normal examples. Most existing methods rely on category-specific training, which limits their flexibility in few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we propose DMP-3DAD, a training-free framework for cross-category 3D anomaly detection based on multi-view realistic depth map projection. Specifically, by converting point clouds into a fixed set of realistic depth images, our method leverages a frozen CLIP visual encoder to extract multi-view representations and performs anomaly detection via weighted feature similarity, which does not require any fine-tuning or category-dependent adaptation. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNetPart dataset demonstrate that DMP-3DAD achieves state-of-the-art performance under few-shot setting. The results show that the proposed approach provides a simple yet effective solution for practical cross-category 3D anomaly detection.

TL;DR: DeepImageSearch introduces an agentic paradigm for image retrieval that treats it as autonomous exploration over visual sequences rather than isolated semantic matching, with DISBench benchmark and modular agent framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal retrieval systems assume query-image relevance can be measured in isolation, overlooking rich dependencies in realistic visual streams where information is distributed across temporal sequences rather than confined to single snapshots.

Method: 1) Introduces DeepImageSearch agentic paradigm reformulating image retrieval as autonomous exploration task; 2) Constructs DISBench benchmark on interconnected visual data; 3) Proposes human-model collaborative pipeline using vision-language models to mine latent spatiotemporal associations; 4) Builds modular agent framework with fine-grained tools and dual-memory system for long-horizon navigation.

Result: DISBench poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art models, demonstrating the necessity of incorporating agentic reasoning into next-generation retrieval systems.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap between isolated semantic matching and realistic visual streams by introducing an agentic paradigm for image retrieval that requires multi-step reasoning over temporal sequences, highlighting the importance of context-dependent reasoning in retrieval systems.

Abstract: Existing multimodal retrieval systems excel at semantic matching but implicitly assume that query-image relevance can be measured in isolation. This paradigm overlooks the rich dependencies inherent in realistic visual streams, where information is distributed across temporal sequences rather than confined to single snapshots. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepImageSearch, a novel agentic paradigm that reformulates image retrieval as an autonomous exploration task. Models must plan and perform multi-step reasoning over raw visual histories to locate targets based on implicit contextual cues. We construct DISBench, a challenging benchmark built on interconnected visual data. To address the scalability challenge of creating context-dependent queries, we propose a human-model collaborative pipeline that employs vision-language models to mine latent spatiotemporal associations, effectively offloading intensive context discovery before human verification. Furthermore, we build a robust baseline using a modular agent framework equipped with fine-grained tools and a dual-memory system for long-horizon navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DISBench poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art models, highlighting the necessity of incorporating agentic reasoning into next-generation retrieval systems.

*Aojun Lu,Tao Feng,Hangjie Yuan,Wei Li,Yanan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC-SFT improves VLM generalization by filtering training data based on difficulty, outperforming both standard SFT and RL methods while being more stable and efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-trained VLMs show better OOD generalization than SFT-trained ones, suggesting RL has an implicit data filtering mechanism that prioritizes medium-difficulty samples. The paper aims to provide a data-centric explanation for this generalization gap.

Method: Difficulty-Curated SFT (DC-SFT) explicitly filters training datasets based on sample difficulty levels. The approach systematically evaluates OOD generalization across different difficulty levels and curates training sets to include optimal difficulty samples.

Result: DC-SFT substantially enhances OOD generalization over standard SFT and even surpasses RL-based training performance. It also provides greater stability and computational efficiency compared to RL methods.

Conclusion: Data difficulty is a critical factor in VLM generalization. Explicit difficulty-based filtering (DC-SFT) offers a more efficient pathway to robust generalization than RL, providing both performance gains and computational benefits.

Abstract: The adaptation of large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through post-training reveals a pronounced generalization gap: models fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning (RL) consistently achieve superior out-of-distribution (OOD) performance compared to those trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This paper posits a data-centric explanation for this phenomenon, contending that RL's generalization advantage arises from an implicit data filtering mechanism that inherently prioritizes medium-difficulty training samples. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate the OOD generalization of SFT models across training datasets of varying difficulty levels. Our results confirm that data difficulty is a critical factor, revealing that training on hard samples significantly degrades OOD performance. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Difficulty-Curated SFT (DC-SFT), a straightforward method that explicitly filters the training set based on sample difficulty. Experiments show that DC-SFT not only substantially enhances OOD generalization over standard SFT, but also surpasses the performance of RL-based training, all while providing greater stability and computational efficiency. This work offers a data-centric account of the OOD generalization gap in VLMs and establishes a more efficient pathway to achieving robust generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowCache is a caching framework that accelerates autoregressive video generation by 2.38-6.7× with minimal quality loss, using chunk-specific caching policies and optimized KV cache compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for ultra-long video generation are slow due to sequential processing. Existing caching methods fail because they assume uniform denoising across frames, which doesn't hold for autoregressive models where different video chunks have varying similarity patterns at the same timesteps.

Method: FlowCache introduces chunkwise caching that allows independent caching policies per video chunk, adapting to each chunk's unique denoising characteristics. It also uses a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism to maintain fixed memory bounds while preserving quality.

Result: Achieves 2.38× speedup on MAGI-1 and 6.7× speedup on SkyReels-V2 with negligible quality degradation (VBench: 0.87 increase and 0.79 decrease respectively).

Conclusion: FlowCache successfully enables real-time, ultra-long video generation with autoregressive models, establishing a new benchmark for efficient video synthesis at scale.

Abstract: Autoregressive models, often built on Transformer architectures, represent a powerful paradigm for generating ultra-long videos by synthesizing content in sequential chunks. However, this sequential generation process is notoriously slow. While caching strategies have proven effective for accelerating traditional video diffusion models, existing methods assume uniform denoising across all frames-an assumption that breaks down in autoregressive models where different video chunks exhibit varying similarity patterns at identical timesteps. In this paper, we present FlowCache, the first caching framework specifically designed for autoregressive video generation. Our key insight is that each video chunk should maintain independent caching policies, allowing fine-grained control over which chunks require recomputation at each timestep. We introduce a chunkwise caching strategy that dynamically adapts to the unique denoising characteristics of each chunk, complemented by a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism that maintains fixed memory bounds while preserving generation quality. Our method achieves remarkable speedups of 2.38 times on MAGI-1 and 6.7 times on SkyReels-V2, with negligible quality degradation (VBench: 0.87 increase and 0.79 decrease respectively). These results demonstrate that FlowCache successfully unlocks the potential of autoregressive models for real-time, ultra-long video generation-establishing a new benchmark for efficient video synthesis at scale.

TL;DR: First hyperspectral smoke segmentation dataset and MoP network with adaptive band weighting for superior smoke segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visible-light methods lack spectral information, struggle with cloud interference and semi-transparent smoke. Hyperspectral imaging can provide richer spectral data for better smoke segmentation.

Method: Proposed mixture of prototypes (MoP) network with: (1) Band split for spectral isolation, (2) Prototype-based spectral representation for diverse patterns, and (3) Dual-level router for adaptive spatial-aware band weighting. Also created HSSDataset (first hyperspectral smoke dataset) and MSSDataset (multispectral RGB-infrared).

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance across both hyperspectral and multispectral modalities, establishing new paradigm for spectral-based smoke segmentation.

Conclusion: Hyperspectral imaging with adaptive band weighting via MoP network provides effective solution for smoke segmentation, overcoming limitations of traditional visible-light methods.

Abstract: Smoke segmentation is critical for wildfire management and industrial safety applications. Traditional visible-light-based methods face limitations due to insufficient spectral information, particularly struggling with cloud interference and semi-transparent smoke regions. To address these challenges, we introduce hyperspectral imaging for smoke segmentation and present the first hyperspectral smoke segmentation dataset (HSSDataset) with carefully annotated samples collected from over 18,000 frames across 20 real-world scenarios using a Many-to-One annotations protocol. However, different spectral bands exhibit varying discriminative capabilities across spatial regions, necessitating adaptive band weighting strategies. We decompose this into three technical challenges: spectral interaction contamination, limited spectral pattern modeling, and complex weighting router problems. We propose a mixture of prototypes (MoP) network with: (1) Band split for spectral isolation, (2) Prototype-based spectral representation for diverse patterns, and (3) Dual-level router for adaptive spatial-aware band weighting. We further construct a multispectral dataset (MSSDataset) with RGB-infrared images. Extensive experiments validate superior performance across both hyperspectral and multispectral modalities, establishing a new paradigm for spectral-based smoke segmentation.

*Darakshan Rashid,Raza Imam,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Brejesh Lall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stride-Net is a fairness-aware framework for chest X-ray classification that learns disease-discriminative yet demographically invariant representations through patch-level masking, adversarial confusion, and semantic alignment with BioBERT embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks for chest X-ray classification often underperform for specific demographic subgroups (race, gender), raising clinical safety and equity concerns. Existing debiasing methods yield inconsistent improvements or degrade overall diagnostic utility by treating fairness as a post hoc constraint rather than a property of the learned representation.

Method: Stride-Net operates at patch level using learnable stride-based masks to select label-aligned regions while suppressing sensitive attribute information via adversarial confusion loss. It enforces semantic alignment between image features and BioBERT-based disease label embeddings using Group Optimal Transport to anchor representations in clinical semantics and discourage shortcut learning.

Result: Evaluated on MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert benchmarks across race and intersectional race-gender subgroups. Across ResNet and Vision Transformer architectures, Stride-Net consistently improves fairness metrics while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy, achieving better accuracy-fairness trade-off than prior debiasing approaches.

Conclusion: Stride-Net provides an effective framework for learning fair chest X-ray classification models that maintain diagnostic utility while reducing demographic bias, addressing critical clinical safety and equity concerns in medical AI.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for chest X-ray classification achieve strong average performance, yet often underperform for specific demographic subgroups, raising critical concerns about clinical safety and equity. Existing debiasing methods frequently yield inconsistent improvements across datasets or attain fairness by degrading overall diagnostic utility, treating fairness as a post hoc constraint rather than a property of the learned representation. In this work, we propose Stride-Net (Sensitive Attribute Resilient Learning via Disentanglement and Learnable Masking with Embedding Alignment), a fairness-aware framework that learns disease-discriminative yet demographically invariant representations for chest X-ray analysis. Stride-Net operates at the patch level, using a learnable stride-based mask to select label-aligned image regions while suppressing sensitive attribute information through adversarial confusion loss. To anchor representations in clinical semantics and discourage shortcut learning, we further enforce semantic alignment between image features and BioBERT-based disease label embeddings via Group Optimal Transport. We evaluate Stride-Net on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert benchmarks across race and intersectional race-gender subgroups. Across architectures including ResNet and Vision Transformers, Stride-Net consistently improves fairness metrics while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy, achieving a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off than prior debiasing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chart Specification: A structured intermediate representation method that improves chart-to-code generation by providing semantically grounded supervision and fine-grained structural feedback, achieving state-of-the-art results with high data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models struggle with structural fidelity in chart-to-code generation, often producing hallucinated or semantically inconsistent outputs due to reliance on surface-level token imitation rather than faithful modeling of underlying chart structure.

Method: Proposes Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation that shifts training from text imitation to semantically grounded supervision. It filters syntactic noise to create a structurally balanced training set and introduces Spec-Align Reward for fine-grained, verifiable feedback on structural correctness, enabling reinforcement learning to enforce consistent plotting logic.

Result: Outperforms prior approaches on three public benchmarks. With only 3K training samples, achieves strong data efficiency (surpassing leading baselines by up to 61.7% on complex benchmarks). Scaling to 4K samples establishes new state-of-the-art results across all evaluated metrics.

Conclusion: Precise structural supervision offers an efficient pathway to high-fidelity chart-to-code generation, demonstrating that semantically grounded training with fine-grained structural feedback significantly improves the quality and consistency of generated plotting code.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating plotting code from chart images, yet achieving structural fidelity remains challenging. Existing approaches largely rely on supervised fine-tuning, encouraging surface-level token imitation rather than faithful modeling of underlying chart structure, which often leads to hallucinated or semantically inconsistent outputs. We propose Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation that shifts training from text imitation to semantically grounded supervision. Chart Specification filters syntactic noise to construct a structurally balanced training set and supports a Spec-Align Reward that provides fine-grained, verifiable feedback on structural correctness, enabling reinforcement learning to enforce consistent plotting logic. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches. With only 3K training samples, we achieve strong data efficiency, surpassing leading baselines by up to 61.7% on complex benchmarks, and scaling to 4K samples establishes new state-of-the-art results across all evaluated metrics. Overall, our results demonstrate that precise structural supervision offers an efficient pathway to high-fidelity chart-to-code generation.

TL;DR: TR-World focuses on dynamic object modeling using temporal residuals to predict future spatial distributions, combined with Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement for improved autonomous driving planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models for autonomous driving have redundant modeling of static regions and lack deep interaction with trajectories, limiting their effectiveness in planning accuracy.

Method: Proposes Temporal Residual World Model (TR-World) that extracts dynamic object information via temporal residuals without detection/tracking, and Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement module that interacts prior trajectories with future BEV features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art planning performance on nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets, with code publicly available.

Conclusion: TR-World with FGTR module effectively improves world model efficiency by focusing on dynamic objects and enabling trajectory-future interaction, leading to superior autonomous driving planning.

Abstract: The comprehensive understanding capabilities of world models for driving scenarios have significantly improved the planning accuracy of end-to-end autonomous driving frameworks. However, the redundant modeling of static regions and the lack of deep interaction with trajectories hinder world models from exerting their full effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Temporal Residual World Model (TR-World), which focuses on dynamic object modeling. By calculating the temporal residuals of scene representations, the information of dynamic objects can be extracted without relying on detection and tracking. TR-World takes only temporal residuals as input, thus predicting the future spatial distribution of dynamic objects more precisely. By combining the prediction with the static object information contained in the current BEV features, accurate future BEV features can be obtained. Furthermore, we propose Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement (FGTR) module, which conducts interaction between prior trajectories (predicted from the current scene representation) and the future BEV features. This module can not only utilize future road conditions to refine trajectories, but also provides sparse spatial-temporal supervision on future BEV features to prevent world model collapse. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrate that our method, namely ResWorld, achieves state-of-the-art planning performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastUSP: A multi-level optimization framework that improves Unified Sequence Parallelism for large diffusion models by addressing kernel launch overhead and computation-communication scheduling inefficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Unified Sequence Parallelism implementations for large diffusion models suffer from significant inefficiencies including excessive kernel launch overhead and suboptimal computation-communication scheduling, limiting inference performance.

Method: FastUSP integrates three levels of optimization: compile-level (graph compilation with CUDA Graphs and computation-communication reordering), communication-level (FP8 quantized collective communication), and operator-level (pipelined Ring attention with double buffering).

Result: On FLUX (12B), FastUSP achieves 1.12×-1.16× speedup over baseline USP, with compile-level optimization providing the dominant improvement. On Qwen-Image, it achieves 1.09× speedup on 2 GPUs, though faces PyTorch Inductor compatibility limitations on 4-8 GPUs.

Conclusion: Kernel launch overhead, not communication latency, is the primary bottleneck for distributed diffusion inference on modern high-bandwidth GPU interconnects, and FastUSP's multi-level optimization effectively addresses this issue.

Abstract: Large-scale diffusion models such as FLUX (12B parameters) and Stable Diffusion 3 (8B parameters) require multi-GPU parallelism for efficient inference. Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP), which combines Ulysses and Ring attention mechanisms, has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for distributed attention computation. However, existing USP implementations suffer from significant inefficiencies including excessive kernel launch overhead and suboptimal computation-communication scheduling. In this paper, we propose \textbf{FastUSP}, a multi-level optimization framework that integrates compile-level optimization (graph compilation with CUDA Graphs and computation-communication reordering), communication-level optimization (FP8 quantized collective communication), and operator-level optimization (pipelined Ring attention with double buffering). We evaluate FastUSP on FLUX (12B) and Qwen-Image models across 2, 4, and 8 NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs. On FLUX, FastUSP achieves consistent \textbf{1.12$\times$--1.16$\times$} end-to-end speedup over baseline USP, with compile-level optimization contributing the dominant improvement. On Qwen-Image, FastUSP achieves \textbf{1.09$\times$} speedup on 2 GPUs; on 4--8 GPUs, we identify a PyTorch Inductor compatibility limitation with Ring attention that prevents compile optimization, while baseline USP scales to 1.30$\times$--1.46$\times$ of 2-GPU performance. We further provide a detailed analysis of the performance characteristics of distributed diffusion inference, revealing that kernel launch overhead -- rather than communication latency -- is the primary bottleneck on modern high-bandwidth GPU interconnects.

This study focuses on 3 different categories for classifying diseases. These are Anthracnose, Fruit flies, and Healthy fruit. The data set used in this study is collected from Mendeley Data. This dataset contains 473 original images of Guava. These images vary in size and format. The original dataset was resized to 256x256 pixels with RGB color mode for better consistency.

TL;DR: VFGS-Net is a retinal vessel segmentation network that integrates frequency-domain attention, dual-path convolution, and bidirectional Mamba2-based spatial modeling to better capture fine capillaries and maintain global topological continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinal vessel segmentation is crucial for quantitative analysis and disease diagnosis, but existing methods struggle with elongated morphology, wide scale variation, and low contrast, making it difficult to preserve fine capillaries while maintaining global topological continuity.

Method: VFGS-Net integrates three key components: 1) dual-path feature convolution module for local textures and multi-scale context, 2) vessel-aware frequency-domain channel attention to enhance vessel-relevant spectral components, and 3) bidirectional asymmetric Mamba2-based spatial modeling block for long-range dependencies and global continuity.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public retinal vessel datasets show competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with consistent improvements for fine vessels, complex branching patterns, and low-contrast regions.

Conclusion: VFGS-Net effectively addresses challenges in retinal vessel segmentation through integrated frequency-aware enhancement and global spatial modeling, demonstrating robustness and clinical potential for accurate vessel analysis.

Abstract: Accurate retinal vessel segmentation is a critical prerequisite for quantitative analysis of retinal images and computer-aided diagnosis of vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. However, the elongated morphology, wide scale variation, and low contrast of retinal vessels pose significant challenges for existing methods, making it difficult to simultaneously preserve fine capillaries and maintain global topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose the Vessel-aware Frequency-domain and Global Spatial modeling Network (VFGS-Net), an end-to-end segmentation framework that seamlessly integrates frequency-aware feature enhancement, dual-path convolutional representation learning, and bidirectional asymmetric spatial state-space modeling within a unified architecture. Specifically, VFGS-Net employs a dual-path feature convolution module to jointly capture fine-grained local textures and multi-scale contextual semantics. A novel vessel-aware frequency-domain channel attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively reweight spectral components, thereby enhancing vessel-relevant responses in high-level features. Furthermore, at the network bottleneck, we propose a bidirectional asymmetric Mamba2-based spatial modeling block to efficiently capture long-range spatial dependencies and strengthen the global continuity of vascular structures. Extensive experiments on four publicly available retinal vessel datasets demonstrate that VFGS-Net achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our model consistently improves segmentation accuracy for fine vessels, complex branching patterns, and low-contrast regions, highlighting its robustness and clinical potential.

TL;DR: DFIC dataset with 58K annotated images and 2.7K videos enables automated ICAO compliance verification for facial images in travel documents, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of facial images for ISO/IEC and ICAO compliance in travel documents is inefficient for high-demand environments, creating need for automated verification methods.

Method: Created comprehensive DFIC dataset with diverse facial images/videos covering compliant and non-compliant conditions, then fine-tuned novel spatial attention-based model for automated ICAO compliance validation.

Result: The method demonstrated improved results over state-of-the-art ICAO compliance verification approaches, with dataset offering better demographic balance than existing public datasets.

Conclusion: DFIC dataset enables enhanced automated ICAO compliance verification and can improve security, privacy, and fairness of facial recognition systems across various applications.

Abstract: Ensuring compliance with ISO/IEC and ICAO standards for facial images in machine-readable travel documents (MRTDs) is essential for reliable identity verification, but current manual inspection methods are inefficient in high-demand environments. This paper introduces the DFIC dataset, a novel comprehensive facial image dataset comprising around 58,000 annotated images and 2706 videos of more than 1000 subjects, that cover a broad range of non-compliant conditions, in addition to compliant portraits. Our dataset provides a more balanced demographic distribution than the existing public datasets, with one partition that is nearly uniformly distributed, facilitating the development of automated ICAO compliance verification methods.
  Using DFIC, we fine-tuned a novel method that heavily relies on spatial attention mechanisms for the automatic validation of ICAO compliance requirements, and we have compared it with the state-of-the-art aimed at ICAO compliance verification, demonstrating improved results. DFIC dataset is now made public (https://github.com/visteam-isr-uc/DFIC) for the training and validation of new models, offering an unprecedented diversity of faces, that will improve both robustness and adaptability to the intrinsically diverse combinations of faces and props that can be presented to the validation system. These results emphasize the potential of DFIC to enhance automated ICAO compliance methods but it can also be used in many other applications that aim to improve the security, privacy, and fairness of facial recognition systems.

TL;DR: SVDA (SVD-Inspired Attention) mechanism adapted to Vision Transformers improves interpretability and sparsity while maintaining accuracy across multiple image classification benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art performance but their attention mechanisms remain opaque and exhibit dense, non-structured behaviors, lacking interpretability.

Method: Adapt SVDA (SVD-Inspired Attention) mechanism to ViT architecture with geometrically grounded formulation, using interpretability indicators to monitor attention dynamics during training and assess structural properties.

Result: SVDA consistently yields more interpretable attention patterns without sacrificing classification accuracy on CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 benchmarks.

Conclusion: SVDA establishes a comprehensive tool for analyzing structured attention models, laying foundation for future advances in explainable AI, spectral diagnostics, and attention-based model compression.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification, yet their attention mechanisms often remain opaque and exhibit dense, non-structured behaviors. In this work, we adapt our previously proposed SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) mechanism to the ViT architecture, introducing a geometrically grounded formulation that enhances interpretability, sparsity, and spectral structure. We apply the use of interpretability indicators -- originally proposed with SVDA -- to monitor attention dynamics during training and assess structural properties of the learned representations. Experimental evaluations on four widely used benchmarks -- CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 -- demonstrate that SVDA consistently yields more interpretable attention patterns without sacrificing classification accuracy. While the current framework offers descriptive insights rather than prescriptive guidance, our results establish SVDA as a comprehensive and informative tool for analyzing and developing structured attention models in computer vision. This work lays the foundation for future advances in explainable AI, spectral diagnostics, and attention-based model compression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention mechanisms in modern Transformer architectures for monocular depth estimation remain opaque and lack interpretability, despite being central to computer vision applications like robotics, AR, and autonomous driving.

Method: Introduces SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) into Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), which decouples directional alignment from spectral modulation by embedding a learnable diagonal matrix into normalized query-key interactions, creating intrinsically interpretable attention maps.

Result: SVDA preserves or slightly improves predictive accuracy on KITTI and NYU-v2 datasets with minor computational overhead, and unlocks six spectral indicators (entropy, rank, sparsity, alignment, selectivity, robustness) that reveal consistent cross-dataset and depth-wise patterns in attention organization.

Conclusion: SVDA redefines interpretability in monocular depth estimation by shifting attention from an opaque mechanism to a quantifiable descriptor, opening a principled avenue toward transparent dense prediction models.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is a central problem in computer vision with applications in robotics, AR, and autonomous driving, yet the self-attention mechanisms that drive modern Transformer architectures remain opaque. We introduce SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) into the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), providing the first spectrally structured formulation of attention for dense prediction tasks. SVDA decouples directional alignment from spectral modulation by embedding a learnable diagonal matrix into normalized query-key interactions, enabling attention maps that are intrinsically interpretable rather than post-hoc approximations. Experiments on KITTI and NYU-v2 show that SVDA preserves or slightly improves predictive accuracy while adding only minor computational overhead. More importantly, SVDA unlocks six spectral indicators that quantify entropy, rank, sparsity, alignment, selectivity, and robustness. These reveal consistent cross-dataset and depth-wise patterns in how attention organizes during training, insights that remain inaccessible in standard Transformers. By shifting the role of attention from opaque mechanism to quantifiable descriptor, SVDA redefines interpretability in monocular depth estimation and opens a principled avenue toward transparent dense prediction models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing query-based 3D instance segmentation methods suffer from query initialization problems due to sparse point clouds and rely on computationally intensive attention mechanisms in decoders.

Method: Proposes hierarchical semantic-spatial query initialization from superpoints, and a coordinate-guided SSM decoder with local aggregation and spatial dual-path SSM blocks that integrate coordinate information.

Result: Achieves 1st place on ScanNet++ V2 leaderboard with 2.5% mAP improvement over previous best using only 1/3 FLOPs. Also shows competitive performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, S3DIS and ScanNet++ V1 benchmarks.

Conclusion: LaSSM demonstrates superior efficiency and performance in large-scale 3D scene instance segmentation by addressing query initialization and computational bottlenecks through novel initialization and decoder designs.

Abstract: Query-based 3D scene instance segmentation from point clouds has attained notable performance. However, existing methods suffer from the query initialization dilemma due to the sparse nature of point clouds and rely on computationally intensive attention mechanisms in query decoders. We accordingly introduce LaSSM, prioritizing simplicity and efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical semantic-spatial query initializer to derive the query set from superpoints by considering both semantic cues and spatial distribution, achieving comprehensive scene coverage and accelerated convergence. We further present a coordinate-guided state space model (SSM) decoder that progressively refines queries. The novel decoder features a local aggregation scheme that restricts the model to focus on geometrically coherent regions and a spatial dual-path SSM block to capture underlying dependencies within the query set by integrating associated coordinates information. Our design enables efficient instance prediction, avoiding the incorporation of noisy information and reducing redundant computation. LaSSM ranks first place on the latest ScanNet++ V2 leaderboard, outperforming the previous best method by 2.5% mAP with only 1/3 FLOPs, demonstrating its superiority in challenging large-scale scene instance segmentation. LaSSM also achieves competitive performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, S3DIS and ScanNet++ V1 benchmarks with less computational cost. Extensive ablation studies and qualitative results validate the effectiveness of our design. The code and weights are available at https://github.com/RayYoh/LaSSM.

Motivation: Accurate surgical instrument counting is critical for patient safety, but current methods struggle in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. Existing approaches like object detection are unordered and fail in complex surgical environments.

Method: Proposes Chain-of-Look framework that mimics human sequential counting by enforcing structured visual chains instead of unordered detection. Introduces neighboring loss function to enforce physical plausibility of spatial relationships in dense instrument arrangements. Also presents SurgCount-HD dataset with 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Look provides an effective solution for accurate surgical instrument counting in challenging dense scenarios, addressing a critical patient safety requirement in operating rooms.

Abstract: Accurate counting of surgical instruments in Operating Rooms (OR) is a critical prerequisite for ensuring patient safety during surgery. Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes. To further enforce the physical plausibility of the visual chain, we introduce the neighboring loss function, which explicitly models the spatial constraints inherent to densely packed surgical instruments. We also present SurgCount-HD, a new dataset comprising 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for counting (e.g., CountGD, REC) as well as Multimodality Large Language Models (e.g., Qwen, ChatGPT) in the challenging task of dense surgical instrument counting.

TL;DR: ViLaVT introduces "chatting with images" framework that enables language-guided visual feature modulation for better cross-modal reasoning in vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs lose fine-grained visual information due to single-pass visual encoding, and existing "thinking with images" approaches lack proper linguistic grounding for effective cross-modal alignment, especially for complex spatial reasoning across multiple images.

Method: Proposes "chatting with images" framework with ViLaVT model featuring dynamic vision encoder for language-guided feature modulation, trained with two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves strong improvements across eight benchmarks, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Language-guided visual feature modulation enables tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates, significantly improving complex visual reasoning capabilities in LVLMs.

Abstract: Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically rely on text-only reasoning based on a single-pass visual encoding, which often leads to loss of fine-grained visual information. Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaVT achieves strong and consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: The First International StepUP Competition for biometric footstep recognition used the new UNB StepUP-P150 dataset to address generalization challenges, with top team achieving 10.77% EER using GRM optimization, but footwear generalization remains a key challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biometric footstep recognition has potential for security applications but has been limited by lack of large, diverse datasets to address generalization challenges like new users and variations in footwear/walking speed.

Method: Organized an international competition using the newly released UNB StepUP-P150 dataset (largest high-resolution footstep pressure collection). Teams developed recognition models evaluated on a separate test set designed to assess verification performance under challenging variations with limited reference data.

Result: Competition attracted 23 global teams. Top-performing team Saeid_UCC achieved best equal error rate (EER) of 10.77% using a generative reward machine (GRM) optimization strategy.

Conclusion: The competition showcased strong solutions for footstep biometrics but revealed persistent challenges in generalizing to unfamiliar footwear, highlighting a critical area for future research.

Abstract: Biometric footstep recognition, based on a person's unique pressure patterns under their feet during walking, is an emerging field with growing applications in security and safety. However, progress in this area has been limited by the lack of large, diverse datasets necessary to address critical challenges such as generalization to new users and robustness to shifts in factors like footwear or walking speed. The recent release of the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset, the largest and most comprehensive collection of high-resolution footstep pressure recordings to date, opens new opportunities for addressing these challenges through deep learning. To mark this milestone, the First International StepUP Competition for Biometric Footstep Recognition was launched. Competitors were tasked with developing robust recognition models using the StepUP-P150 dataset that were then evaluated on a separate, dedicated test set designed to assess verification performance under challenging variations, given limited and relatively homogeneous reference data.

TL;DR: FastFlow is a plug-and-play adaptive inference framework that accelerates flow-matching models by skipping denoising steps that make minor adjustments, achieving over 2.6x speedup while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-matching models have state-of-the-art fidelity but are slow due to sequential denoising. Existing acceleration methods are static, require retraining, and don't generalize well across tasks.

Method: FastFlow identifies denoising steps with minor adjustments and approximates them using finite-difference velocity estimates from prior predictions. It models step-skipping decisions as a multi-armed bandit problem to learn optimal skips balancing speed and performance.

Result: Achieves over 2.6x speedup while maintaining high-quality outputs across image generation, video generation, and editing tasks. Integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines without retraining.

Conclusion: FastFlow provides an effective adaptive inference framework that accelerates flow-matching models through intelligent step skipping, offering significant speed improvements without quality degradation across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Flow-matching models deliver state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video generation, but the inherent sequential denoising process renders them slower. Existing acceleration methods like distillation, trajectory truncation, and consistency approaches are static, require retraining, and often fail to generalize across tasks. We propose FastFlow, a plug-and-play adaptive inference framework that accelerates generation in flow matching models. FastFlow identifies denoising steps that produce only minor adjustments to the denoising path and approximates them without using the full neural network models used for velocity predictions. The approximation utilizes finite-difference velocity estimates from prior predictions to efficiently extrapolate future states, enabling faster advancements along the denoising path at zero compute cost. This enables skipping computation at intermediary steps. We model the decision of how many steps to safely skip before requiring a full model computation as a multi-armed bandit problem. The bandit learns the optimal skips to balance speed with performance. FastFlow integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines and generalizes across image generation, video generation, and editing tasks. Experiments demonstrate a speedup of over 2.6x while maintaining high-quality outputs. The source code for this work can be found at https://github.com/Div290/FastFlow.

TL;DR: HairWeaver is a diffusion-based pipeline that animates single human images with realistic hair dynamics using specialized LoRA modules for motion control and domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods successfully control body pose but lack specific control over hair, resulting in stiff and unrealistic hair animations that fail to capture intricate hair motions.

Method: Uses two specialized modules: Motion-Context-LoRA to integrate motion conditions and Sim2Real-Domain-LoRA to preserve photoreal appearance across domains. These lightweight components guide a video diffusion backbone while maintaining generative capabilities. Trained on specialized dataset of dynamic human motion from CG simulator.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, producing lifelike human hair animations with dynamic details and fine control over hair motion.

Conclusion: HairWeaver overcomes limitations of existing methods by providing realistic and expressive hair dynamics in human image animations through specialized diffusion-based approach.

Abstract: We present HairWeaver, a diffusion-based pipeline that animates a single human image with realistic and expressive hair dynamics. While existing methods successfully control body pose, they lack specific control over hair, and as a result, fail to capture the intricate hair motions, resulting in stiff and unrealistic animations. HairWeaver overcomes this limitation using two specialized modules: a Motion-Context-LoRA to integrate motion conditions and a Sim2Real-Domain-LoRA to preserve the subject's photoreal appearance across different data domains. These lightweight components are designed to guide a video diffusion backbone while maintaining its core generative capabilities. By training on a specialized dataset of dynamic human motion generated from a CG simulator, HairWeaver affords fine control over hair motion and ultimately learns to produce highly realistic hair that responds naturally to movement. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, producing lifelike human hair animations with dynamic details.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhyCritic is a multimodal critic model specialized for physical AI tasks, using a two-stage RLVR pipeline to enhance physical perception and reasoning, outperforming general-purpose critics on physical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal critics are trained primarily on general visual domains (captioning, image QA), leaving physical AI tasks involving perception, causal reasoning, and planning underexplored. There's a need for specialized critics that can reliably evaluate physical AI capabilities.

Method: Two-stage RLVR pipeline: 1) Physical skill warmup stage enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, 2) Self-referential critic finetuning where the critic generates its own prediction as internal reference before judging candidate responses, improving judgment stability and physical correctness.

Result: PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks. When applied as a policy model, it further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks.

Conclusion: PhyCritic demonstrates that specialized critic models for physical AI can outperform general-purpose critics, and the self-referential critic finetuning approach improves judgment stability and physical correctness, with potential applications as both evaluators and policy models.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large multimodal models, reliable judge and critic models have become essential for open-ended evaluation and preference alignment, providing pairwise preferences, numerical scores, and explanatory justifications for assessing model-generated responses. However, existing critics are primarily trained in general visual domains such as captioning or image question answering, leaving physical AI tasks involving perception, causal reasoning, and planning largely underexplored. We introduce PhyCritic, a multimodal critic model optimized for physical AI through a two-stage RLVR pipeline: a physical skill warmup stage that enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, followed by self-referential critic finetuning, where the critic generates its own prediction as an internal reference before judging candidate responses, improving judgment stability and physical correctness. Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as a policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks.

TL;DR: DiNa-LRM: A diffusion-native latent reward model that formulates preference learning directly on noisy diffusion states, outperforming existing diffusion-based reward baselines while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current preference optimization for diffusion models relies on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as reward providers, which are computationally expensive and suffer from domain mismatch when optimizing latent diffusion generators through pixel-space rewards.

Method: Introduces a diffusion-native latent reward model with noise-calibrated Thurstone likelihood using diffusion-noise-dependent uncertainty. Uses a pretrained latent diffusion backbone with timestep-conditioned reward head and supports inference-time noise ensembling for test-time scaling.

Result: Substantially outperforms existing diffusion-based reward baselines, achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art VLMs at a fraction of computational cost, and improves preference optimization dynamics for faster and more resource-efficient model alignment.

Conclusion: DiNa-LRM provides an effective and efficient diffusion-native approach for preference optimization that addresses computational cost and domain mismatch issues of current VLM-based reward methods.

Abstract: Preference optimization for diffusion and flow-matching models relies on reward functions that are both discriminatively robust and computationally efficient. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as the primary reward provider, leveraging their rich multimodal priors to guide alignment. However, their computation and memory cost can be substantial, and optimizing a latent diffusion generator through a pixel-space reward introduces a domain mismatch that complicates alignment. In this paper, we propose DiNa-LRM, a diffusion-native latent reward model that formulates preference learning directly on noisy diffusion states. Our method introduces a noise-calibrated Thurstone likelihood with diffusion-noise-dependent uncertainty. DiNa-LRM leverages a pretrained latent diffusion backbone with a timestep-conditioned reward head, and supports inference-time noise ensembling, providing a diffusion-native mechanism for test-time scaling and robust rewarding. Across image alignment benchmarks, DiNa-LRM substantially outperforms existing diffusion-based reward baselines and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art VLMs at a fraction of the computational cost. In preference optimization, we demonstrate that DiNa-LRM improves preference optimization dynamics, enabling faster and more resource-efficient model alignment.

Conclusion: SurfPhase enables effective reconstruction of 3D interfacial dynamics in two-phase flows from sparse camera views, addressing limitations of existing methods for measuring sharp, deformable liquid-vapor interfaces.

Abstract: Interfacial dynamics in two-phase flows govern momentum, heat, and mass transfer, yet remain difficult to measure experimentally.

TL;DR: ECHWR is a training framework that improves online handwriting recognition on edge devices by using contrastive learning with error-based hard negatives, achieving better accuracy without increasing inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online handwriting recognition using IMUs enables handwriting on paper as digital input, but edge hardware has memory constraints. Need to improve accuracy without increasing inference costs for privacy and latency benefits.

Method: ECHWR uses a temporary auxiliary branch during training to align sensor signals with semantic text embeddings via dual contrastive loss: in-batch contrastive loss for modality alignment and novel error-based contrastive loss that distinguishes correct signals from synthetic hard negatives. The auxiliary branch is discarded after training.

Result: On OnHW-Words500 dataset, ECHWR significantly outperforms SOTA baselines, reducing character error rates by up to 7.4% on writer-independent split and 10.4% on writer-dependent split. Error-based contrastive loss effectively handles unseen writing styles.

Conclusion: ECHWR improves handwriting recognition accuracy on edge devices without increasing inference costs through error-enhanced contrastive learning, with error-based contrastive loss being particularly effective for handling diverse writing styles.

Abstract: Online handwriting recognition using inertial measurement units opens up handwriting on paper as input for digital devices. Doing it on edge hardware improves privacy and lowers latency, but entails memory constraints. To address this, we propose Error-enhanced Contrastive Handwriting Recognition (ECHWR), a training framework designed to improve feature representation and recognition accuracy without increasing inference costs. ECHWR utilizes a temporary auxiliary branch that aligns sensor signals with semantic text embeddings during the training phase. This alignment is maintained through a dual contrastive objective: an in-batch contrastive loss for general modality alignment and a novel error-based contrastive loss that distinguishes between correct signals and synthetic hard negatives. The auxiliary branch is discarded after training, which allows the deployed model to keep its original, efficient architecture. Evaluations on the OnHW-Words500 dataset show that ECHWR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing character error rates by up to 7.4% on the writer-independent split and 10.4% on the writer-dependent split. Finally, although our ablation studies indicate that solving specific challenges require specific architectural and objective configurations, error-based contrastive loss shows its effectiveness for handling unseen writing styles.

TL;DR: LLMs can predict stroke functional outcomes from admission notes with accuracy comparable to models using structured clinical data, supporting text-based prognostic tools for clinical workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mRS prediction relies on structured variables and conventional ML, but LLMs' ability to infer outcomes directly from admission notes remains unexplored, potentially enabling seamless clinical integration without manual data extraction.

Method: Evaluated encoder (BERT, NYUTron) and generative (Llama-3.1-8B, MedGemma-4B) LLMs in frozen/fine-tuned settings for discharge/90-day mRS prediction using 9,485 discharge and 1,898 90-day notes from NYU stroke registry (2016-2025). Used temporal split with most recent 12 months for testing, compared against structured-data baselines with NIHSS and age.

Result: Fine-tuned Llama achieved highest performance: 90-day exact mRS accuracy 33.9% (95% CI 27.9-39.9%) and binary accuracy 76.3% (70.7-81.9%). Discharge performance: 42.0% exact accuracy (39.0-45.0%) and 75.0% binary accuracy (72.4-77.6%). For 90-day prediction, Llama performed comparably to structured-data baselines.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs can predict post-stroke functional outcomes from admission notes alone with performance comparable to models requiring structured variable abstraction, supporting development of text-based prognostic tools that integrate seamlessly into clinical workflows.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke can inform clinical decision-making and resource allocation. Prior work on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) prediction has relied primarily on structured variables (e.g., age, NIHSS) and conventional machine learning. The ability of large language models (LLMs) to infer future mRS scores directly from routine admission notes remains largely unexplored. We evaluated encoder (BERT, NYUTron) and generative (Llama-3.1-8B, MedGemma-4B) LLMs, in both frozen and fine-tuned settings, for discharge and 90-day mRS prediction using a large, real-world stroke registry. The discharge outcome dataset included 9,485 History and Physical notes and the 90-day outcome dataset included 1,898 notes from the NYU Langone Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry (2016-2025). Data were temporally split with the most recent 12 months held out for testing. Performance was assessed using exact (7-class) mRS accuracy and binary functional outcome (mRS 0-2 vs. 3-6) accuracy and compared against established structured-data baselines incorporating NIHSS and age. Fine-tuned Llama achieved the highest performance, with 90-day exact mRS accuracy of 33.9% [95% CI, 27.9-39.9%] and binary accuracy of 76.3% [95% CI, 70.7-81.9%]. Discharge performance reached 42.0% [95% CI, 39.0-45.0%] exact accuracy and 75.0% [95% CI, 72.4-77.6%] binary accuracy. For 90-day prediction, Llama performed comparably to structured-data baselines. Fine-tuned LLMs can predict post-stroke functional outcomes from admission notes alone, achieving performance comparable to models requiring structured variable abstraction. Our findings support the development of text-based prognostic tools that integrate seamlessly into clinical workflows without manual data extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AI has achieved gold-medal performance in math competitions, there's a gap between competition-level problem-solving and professional mathematical research, which requires navigating literature and constructing long-horizon proofs.

Method: Aletheia uses an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think for reasoning, a novel inference-time scaling law that extends beyond Olympiad problems, and intensive tool use to handle mathematical research complexities.

Result: Aletheia achieved three major milestones: (1) fully AI-generated research paper on eigenweights in arithmetic geometry, (2) human-AI collaborative paper on independent sets bounds, and (3) autonomous solutions to four open problems from Bloom's Erdos Conjectures database.

Conclusion: The paper proposes codifying standards for AI autonomy and novelty in mathematics, and reflects on human-AI collaboration, demonstrating AI's growing capability in mathematical research from competition to professional levels.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational models have yielded reasoning systems capable of achieving a gold-medal standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad. The transition from competition-level problem-solving to professional research, however, requires navigating vast literature and constructing long-horizon proofs. In this work, we introduce Aletheia, a math research agent that iteratively generates, verifies, and revises solutions end-to-end in natural language. Specifically, Aletheia is powered by an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think for challenging reasoning problems, a novel inference-time scaling law that extends beyond Olympiad-level problems, and intensive tool use to navigate the complexities of mathematical research. We demonstrate the capability of Aletheia from Olympiad problems to PhD-level exercises and most notably, through several distinct milestones in AI-assisted mathematics research: (a) a research paper (Feng26) generated by AI without any human intervention in calculating certain structure constants in arithmetic geometry called eigenweights; (b) a research paper (LeeSeo26) demonstrating human-AI collaboration in proving bounds on systems of interacting particles called independent sets; and (c) an extensive semi-autonomous evaluation (Feng et al., 2026a) of 700 open problems on Bloom's Erdos Conjectures database, including autonomous solutions to four open questions. In order to help the public better understand the developments pertaining to AI and mathematics, we suggest codifying standard levels quantifying autonomy and novelty of AI-assisted results. We conclude with reflections on human-AI collaboration in mathematics.

*Benjamin R. Redhead,Thomas L. Lee,Peng Gu,Víctor Elvira,Amos Storkey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two new kernel-based metrics (Sig-MMD and CSig-MMD) for evaluating probabilistic forecasts that address limitations of current methods by capturing dependencies and improving sensitivity to tail events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current probabilistic forecasting evaluation frameworks lack consensus metrics and have critical flaws: they assume independence across time/variables and lack sensitivity to tail events, which are crucial for real-world decision-making in high-stakes domains like finance, epidemiology, and climate science.

Method: Proposes two kernel-based metrics: signature maximum mean discrepancy (Sig-MMD) and censored Sig-MMD (CSig-MMD). These leverage signature kernels to capture complex inter-variate and inter-temporal dependencies while being robust to missing data. CSig-MMD adds a censoring scheme that prioritizes tail event prediction while maintaining properness.

Result: The proposed metrics enable more reliable evaluation of direct multi-step forecasting by addressing dependency assumptions and tail event sensitivity issues in current methods.

Conclusion: These new metrics facilitate the development of more robust probabilistic forecasting algorithms by providing better evaluation tools that capture dependencies and prioritize tail events while maintaining proper scoring rule properties.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting is increasingly critical across high-stakes domains, from finance and epidemiology to climate science. However, current evaluation frameworks lack a consensus metric and suffer from two critical flaws: they often assume independence across time steps or variables, and they demonstrably lack sensitivity to tail events, the very occurrences that are most pivotal in real-world decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose two kernel-based metrics: the signature maximum mean discrepancy (Sig-MMD) and our novel censored Sig-MMD (CSig-MMD). By leveraging the signature kernel, these metrics capture complex inter-variate and inter-temporal dependencies and remain robust to missing data. Furthermore, CSig-MMD introduces a censoring scheme that prioritizes a forecaster's capability to predict tail events while strictly maintaining properness, a vital property for a good scoring rule. These metrics enable a more reliable evaluation of direct multi-step forecasting, facilitating the development of more robust probabilistic algorithms.

TL;DR: Versor introduces a novel sequence architecture using Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) to replace traditional non-linear operations, achieving structural generalization, improved interpretability, and efficiency with linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional architectures (Transformers, Graph Networks) that lack native geometric awareness, require explicit structural encoding, and suffer from catastrophic failure in out-of-distribution scenarios. The goal is to create a geometrically-aware foundation for scientific modeling with better generalization.

Method: Versor embeds states in the Cl₄,₁ manifold and evolves them via geometric transformations (rotors), natively representing SE(3)-equivariant relationships without explicit structural encoding. Uses Conformal Geometric Algebra in place of traditional non-linear operations, with a novel Recursive Rotor Accumulator for O(L) linear complexity and custom Clifford kernels for efficiency.

Result: Consistently outperforms Transformers, Graph Networks, and geometric baselines (GATr, EGNN) on chaotic N-body dynamics, topological reasoning, and multimodal benchmarks (CIFAR-10, WikiText-103). Achieves 200× fewer parameters, interpretable attention decomposing into proximity/orientation components, 99.3% MCC on topology (vs. 50.4% for ViT), zero-shot scale generalization, and maintains stable predictions in OOD tests where Transformers fail catastrophically. Custom Clifford kernels provide up to 78× speedup.

Conclusion: Versor provides a scalable foundation for geometrically-aware scientific modeling, demonstrating superior performance, interpretability, and efficiency over existing architectures while offering native geometric understanding and robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: A novel sequence architecture design is introduced, Versor, which uses Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) in place of the traditional fundamental non-linear operations to achieve structural generalization and significant performance improvements on a variety of tasks, while offering improved interpretability and efficiency. By embedding states in the $Cl_{4,1}$ manifold and evolving them via geometric transformations (rotors), Versor natively represents $SE(3)$-equivariant relationships without requiring explicit structural encoding. Versor is validated on chaotic N-body dynamics, topological reasoning, and standard multimodal benchmarks (CIFAR-10, WikiText-103), consistently outperforming Transformers, Graph Networks, and geometric baselines (GATr, EGNN). Key results include: orders of magnitude fewer parameters ($200\times$ vs. Transformers); interpretable attention decomposing into proximity and orientational components; zero-shot scale generalization (99.3% MCC on topology vs. 50.4% for ViT); and $O(L)$ linear complexity via the novel Recursive Rotor Accumulator. In out-of-distribution tests, Versor maintains stable predictions while Transformers fail catastrophically. Custom Clifford kernels achieve up to $78\times$ speedup, providing a scalable foundation for geometrically-aware scientific modeling.

### [89] [Adaptive Optimization via Momentum on Variance-Normalized Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10204)
*Francisco Patitucci,Aryan Mokhtari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MVN-Grad is a new Adam-style optimizer that applies momentum after variance normalization, improving stability and performance by decoupling stale momentum from stochastic normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Adam-type optimizers suffer from cross-time coupling between stale momentum and stochastic normalization, which can lead to instability and suboptimal performance. The paper aims to create a more stable optimizer with better generalization.

Method: MVN-Grad combines variance-based normalization with momentum applied after normalization. It scales each coordinate by an exponential moving average of gradient uncertainty, then applies momentum to the normalized gradients, eliminating the problematic coupling in standard Adam updates.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows MVN-Grad has strictly smaller one-step conditional update variance than momentum-then-normalize methods, is robust to outliers with uniformly bounded response to gradient spikes, and avoids sign-type collapse in low-variance regimes. Empirically, it matches or outperforms Adam, AdaBelief, and LaProp on CIFAR-100 and GPT-style language modeling benchmarks with smoother training and improved generalization.

Conclusion: MVN-Grad provides a theoretically sound and practically effective optimizer that addresses fundamental limitations of Adam-type methods, offering better stability, outlier robustness, and convergence properties without additional computational overhead.

Abstract: We introduce MVN-Grad (Momentum on Variance-Normalized Gradients), an Adam-style optimizer that improves stability and performance by combining two complementary ideas: variance-based normalization and momentum applied after normalization. MVN-Grad scales each coordinate by an exponential moving average of gradient uncertainty and applies momentum to the resulting normalized gradients, eliminating the cross-time coupling between stale momentum and a stochastic normalizer present in standard Adam-type updates. We prove that this decoupling yields strictly smaller one-step conditional update variance than momentum-then-normalize variance methods under standard noise assumptions, and that MVN-Grad is robust to outliers: it has a uniformly bounded response to single gradient spikes.
  In low-variance regimes, we further show variance normalization avoids sign-type collapse associated with second-moment scaling and can yield accelerated convergence. Across CIFAR-100 image classification and GPT-style language modeling benchmarks, MVN-Grad matches or outperforms Adam, AdaBelief, and LaProp, delivering smoother training and improved generalization with no added overhead.

TL;DR: Neural network construction of Euclidean scalar QFTs using transformer attention heads, with analysis of n-point correlators and their behavior in infinite-width and large-head limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a connection between neural network architectures (specifically transformer attention heads) and Euclidean scalar quantum field theories, enabling the construction of QFTs from neural network components and studying their statistical properties.

Method: Define n-point correlators by averaging over random network parameters in the NN-QFT framework. Use single attention head with shared random softmax weights to couple width coordinates, analyze two-point functions in attention-weight representation, engineer Euclidean-invariant kernels via random-feature token embeddings, and analyze connected four-point functions.

Result: Non-Gaussian field statistics persist in infinite-width limit. Two-point function computed in attention-weight representation. Identified "independence-breaking" contribution in four-point function that remains finite at infinite width. Summing many independent heads with 1/N_h normalization suppresses connected non-Gaussian correlators as 1/N_h, yielding Gaussian NN-QFT in large-head limit.

Conclusion: Transformer attention heads can construct Euclidean scalar QFTs with controllable statistical properties. Non-Gaussianity persists at infinite width but can be suppressed by summing many independent heads, leading to Gaussian theories in the large-head limit.

Abstract: We propose a neural-network construction of Euclidean scalar quantum field theories from transformer attention heads, defining $n$-point correlators by averaging over random network parameters in the NN-QFT framework. For a single attention head, shared random softmax weights couple different width coordinates and induce non-Gaussian field statistics that persist in the infinite-width limit $d_k\to\infty$. We compute the two-point function in an attention-weight representation and show how Euclidean-invariant kernels can be engineered via random-feature token embeddings. We then analyze the connected four-point function and identify an "independence-breaking" contribution, expressible as a covariance over query-key weights, which remains finite at infinite width. Finally, we show that summing many independent heads with standard $1/N_h$ normalization suppresses connected non-Gaussian correlators as $1/N_h$, yielding a Gaussian NN-QFT in the large-head limit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive questions requiring up-to-date info and multi-hop reasoning. Existing benchmarks often overlap with pretraining data, making it hard to distinguish genuine retrieval/reasoning from parametric recall.

Method: Automatically couples unstructured text and structured knowledge graph representations from recent arXiv papers, generates knowledge-intensive QA pairs grounded in explicit reasoning paths. Supports flexible domain/time-frame selection for contamination-aware evaluation.

Result: Experiments across AI, governance/policy, and bioinformatics domains show HybridRAG-Bench rewards genuine retrieval and reasoning rather than parametric recall, providing a principled testbed for hybrid knowledge-augmented reasoning systems.

Conclusion: HybridRAG-Bench offers a contamination-aware, customizable framework for evaluating retrieval-intensive multi-hop reasoning over hybrid knowledge, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks that overlap with LLM pretraining data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with knowledge-intensive questions that require up-to-date information and multi-hop reasoning. Augmenting LLMs with hybrid external knowledge, such as unstructured text and structured knowledge graphs, offers a promising alternative to costly continual pretraining. As such, reliable evaluation of their retrieval and reasoning capabilities becomes critical. However, many existing benchmarks increasingly overlap with LLM pretraining data, which means answers or supporting knowledge may already be encoded in model parameters, making it difficult to distinguish genuine retrieval and reasoning from parametric recall. We introduce HybridRAG-Bench, a framework for constructing benchmarks to evaluate retrieval-intensive, multi-hop reasoning over hybrid knowledge. HybridRAG-Bench automatically couples unstructured text and structured knowledge graph representations derived from recent scientific literature on arXiv, and generates knowledge-intensive question-answer pairs grounded in explicit reasoning paths. The framework supports flexible domain and time-frame selection, enabling contamination-aware and customizable evaluation as models and knowledge evolve. Experiments across three domains (artificial intelligence, governance and policy, and bioinformatics) demonstrate that HybridRAG-Bench rewards genuine retrieval and reasoning rather than parametric recall, offering a principled testbed for evaluating hybrid knowledge-augmented reasoning systems. We release our code and data at github.com/junhongmit/HybridRAG-Bench.

### [92] [Binary Flow Matching: Prediction-Loss Space Alignment for Robust Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10420)
*Jiadong Hong,Lei Liu,Xinyu Bian,Wenjie Wang,Zhaoyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flow matching on binary manifolds requires signal-space alignment (x-loss) to avoid singular weighting issues that arise with velocity-based objectives (v-loss), enabling robust training with uniform timestep sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend flow matching's empirical success with signal-space prediction (x-prediction) to binary manifolds for discrete data generation, while addressing the latent structural mismatch that occurs when x-prediction is coupled with velocity-based objectives.

Method: Formalize prediction-loss alignment as necessary condition for flow matching training; prove that aligning objective to signal space (x-loss) eliminates singular weighting; examine design choices specific to binary data including probabilistic vs geometric losses.

Result: Signal-space alignment yields uniformly bounded gradients and enables robust training under uniform timestep sampling without heuristic schedules; reveals topology-dependent distinction between probabilistic objectives (cross-entropy) and geometric losses (MSE).

Conclusion: Signal-space alignment is a key principle for robust flow matching on binary and related discrete domains, providing theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for discrete diffusion learning.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling, with recent empirical successes highlighting the effectiveness of signal-space prediction ($x$-prediction). In this work, we investigate the transfer of this paradigm to binary manifolds, a fundamental setting for generative modeling of discrete data. While $x$-prediction remains effective, we identify a latent structural mismatch that arises when it is coupled with velocity-based objectives ($v$-loss), leading to a time-dependent singular weighting that amplifies gradient sensitivity to approximation errors. Motivated by this observation, we formalize prediction-loss alignment as a necessary condition for flow matching training. We prove that re-aligning the objective to the signal space ($x$-loss) eliminates the singular weighting, yielding uniformly bounded gradients and enabling robust training under uniform timestep sampling without reliance on heuristic schedules. Finally, with alignment secured, we examine design choices specific to binary data, revealing a topology-dependent distinction between probabilistic objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and geometric losses (e.g., mean squared error). Together, these results provide theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for robust flow matching on binary -- and related discrete -- domains, positioning signal-space alignment as a key principle for robust diffusion learning.

*Michael Rushka,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis shows LoRA's accuracy depends on update rank, with gradient flow analysis establishing explicit rank-accuracy relationships for two loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While empirical studies show LoRA achieves comparable accuracy to full-parameter fine-tuning even with low-rank updates, the theoretical understanding of how LoRA's accuracy depends on update rank remains limited.

Method: Gradient flow analysis in both full-rank and low-rank regimes, rigorous derivation of LoRA gradient flow equations, and analysis of simultaneous vs sequential parameter updates to establish explicit relationships between rank and accuracy.

Result: Derived closed-form relationships between LoRA rank and accuracy for trace-squared and Frobenius-norm low-rank approximation loss functions, showing gradient flow equations are identical for simultaneous and sequential LoRA updates.

Conclusion: Theoretical framework provides explicit mathematical relationships explaining LoRA's performance dependence on rank, bridging empirical observations with theoretical understanding of low-rank fine-tuning dynamics.

Abstract: Previous empirical studies have shown that LoRA achieves accuracy comparable to full-parameter methods on downstream fine-tuning tasks, even for rank-1 updates. By contrast, the theoretical underpinnings of the dependence of LoRA's accuracy on update rank remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we compare the accuracy of rank-r LoRA updates against full-parameter updates for fine-tuning tasks from a dynamical systems perspective. We perform gradient flow analysis in both full-rank and low-rank regimes to establish explicit relationships between rank and accuracy for two loss functions under LoRA. While gradient flow equations for LoRA are presented in prior work, we rigorously derive their form and show that they are identical for simultaneous and sequential LoRA parameter updates. We then use the resulting dynamical system equations to obtain closed-form relationships between LoRA rank and accuracy for trace-squared and Frobenius-norm low-rank approximation loss functions.

*Paweł Skierś,Tomasz Trzciński,Kamil Deja*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework to disentangle semantic variations in diffusion models by analyzing gradients from stochastic realizations of a single prompt, enabling precise control over visual outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models produce varied visual outputs from a single text prompt through stochastic processes, leaving users with no direct control over which specific semantic variations appear in the generated images. Existing unsupervised methods analyze variations via output features but ignore the underlying generative process.

Method: Collect gradients by backpropagating differences between stochastic realizations of a fixed prompt, then decompose these gradients into meaningful steering directions using Principal Components Analysis or Sparse Autoencoder. This isolates interpretable directions directly within the input embedding space.

Result: The approach achieves three key outcomes: (1) isolates interpretable, steerable directions for precise fine-grained control over single concepts; (2) effectively mitigates mode collapse in distilled models by reintroducing lost diversity; (3) establishes a novel estimator for concept complexity based on the dimensionality of discovered subspaces.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a systematic way to understand and control semantic variations in diffusion models by analyzing the generative process directly in embedding space, offering improved controllability, diversity restoration, and conceptual complexity measurement.

Abstract: A single text prompt passed to a diffusion model often yields a wide range of visual outputs determined solely by stochastic process, leaving users with no direct control over which specific semantic variations appear in the image. While existing unsupervised methods attempt to analyze these variations via output features, they omit the underlying generative process. In this work, we propose a framework to disentangle these semantic directions directly within the input embedding space. To that end, we collect a set of gradients obtained by backpropagating the differences between stochastic realizations of a fixed prompt that we later decompose into meaningful steering directions with either Principal Components Analysis or Sparse Autoencoder. Our approach yields three key contributions: (1) it isolates interpretable, steerable directions for precise, fine-grained control over a single concept; (2) it effectively mitigates mode collapse in distilled models by reintroducing lost diversity; and (3) it establishes a novel estimator for concept complexity under a specific model, based on the dimensionality of the discovered subspace.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T3-Unlearning: A two-step inference method for machine unlearning in generative models that uses tempering to flatten distribution spikes followed by classifier-guided tilting, achieving better forget quality with minimal parameter training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard classifier guidance for machine unlearning can fail when the forget set represents sharp, concentrated data distributions, requiring a more robust approach that works with finite samples.

Method: Temper-Then-Tilt Unlearning (T3-Unlearning) freezes the base model and applies: (1) tempering to flatten high-confidence spikes in the base distribution, and (2) tilting using a lightweight classifier trained to distinguish retain from forget samples.

Result: Theoretical analysis provides finite-sample guarantees linking classifier risk to unlearning error, proving tempering is necessary for concentrated distributions. Empirical evaluations on TOFU benchmark show improved forget quality and generative utility over baselines with minimal runtime and parameter training.

Conclusion: T3-Unlearning effectively addresses limitations of classifier guidance for concentrated forget distributions through a principled two-step inference approach that maintains model utility while achieving robust unlearning with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We study machine unlearning in large generative models by framing the task as density ratio estimation to a target distribution rather than supervised fine-tuning. While classifier guidance is a standard approach for approximating this ratio and can succeed in general, we show it can fail to faithfully unlearn with finite samples when the forget set represents a sharp, concentrated data distribution. To address this, we introduce Temper-Then-Tilt Unlearning (T3-Unlearning), which freezes the base model and applies a two-step inference procedure: (i) tempering the base distribution to flatten high-confidence spikes, and (ii) tilting the tempered distribution using a lightweight classifier trained to distinguish retain from forget samples. Our theoretical analysis provides finite-sample guarantees linking the surrogate classifier's risk to unlearning error, proving that tempering is necessary to successfully unlearn for concentrated distributions. Empirical evaluations on the TOFU benchmark show that T3-Unlearning improves forget quality and generative utility over existing baselines, while training only a fraction of the parameters with a minimal runtime.

TL;DR: MEL framework enhances RLVR by adding meta-experience learning - distilling reusable knowledge from error analysis into LLM's parametric memory for better reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR lacks mechanisms for error attribution and experience internalization beyond practice and verification, limiting fine-grained credit assignment and reusable knowledge formation.

Method: Adds meta-experience learning to RLVR: uses LLM's self-verification to analyze correct/incorrect trajectory pairs, identify error bifurcation points, summarize into meta-experience, and internalize via negative log-likelihood minimization.

Result: MEL achieves 3.92%--4.73% Pass@1 gains across varying model sizes, showing consistent improvements on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Meta-experience learning effectively addresses RLVR's limitations by enabling error attribution and reusable knowledge formation, leading to significant performance improvements in LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its efficacy, RLVR faces a meta-learning bottleneck: it lacks mechanisms for error attribution and experience internalization intrinsic to the human learning cycle beyond practice and verification, thereby limiting fine-grained credit assignment and reusable knowledge formation. We term such reusable knowledge representations derived from past errors as meta-experience. Based on this insight, we propose Meta-Experience Learning (MEL), a novel framework that incorporates self-distilled meta-experience into the model's parametric memory. Building upon standard RLVR, we introduce an additional design that leverages the LLM's self-verification capability to conduct contrastive analysis on paired correct and incorrect trajectories, identify the precise bifurcation points where reasoning errors arise, and summarize them into generalizable meta-experience. The meta-experience is further internalized into the LLM's parametric memory by minimizing the negative log-likelihood, which induces a language-modeled reward signal that bridges correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories and facilitates effective knowledge reuse. Experimental results demonstrate that MEL achieves consistent improvements on benchmarks, yielding 3.92%--4.73% Pass@1 gains across varying model sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing large-scale ML systems like video platform recommendation models requires navigating massive hyperparameter spaces and designing sophisticated optimizers/architectures, traditionally relying on extensive manual iterations which is time-consuming and inefficient.

Method: Proposes a self-evolving system using Google's Gemini LLMs with two agents: Offline Agent (Inner Loop) for high-throughput hypothesis generation using proxy metrics, and Online Agent (Outer Loop) for live production validation against delayed business metrics. Agents act as specialized MLEs with deep reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: LLM-driven autonomous systems can effectively discover novel improvements in optimization algorithms, model architectures, and reward functions for large-scale recommendation systems, representing a significant advancement over manual engineering approaches.

Abstract: Optimizing large-scale machine learning systems, such as recommendation models for global video platforms, requires navigating a massive hyperparameter search space and, more critically, designing sophisticated optimizers, architectures, and reward functions to capture nuanced user behaviors. Achieving substantial improvements in these areas is a non-trivial task, traditionally relying on extensive manual iterations to test new hypotheses. We propose a self-evolving system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically those from Google's Gemini family, to autonomously generate, train, and deploy high-performing, complex model changes within an end-to-end automated workflow. The self-evolving system is comprised of an Offline Agent (Inner Loop) that performs high-throughput hypothesis generation using proxy metrics, and an Online Agent (Outer Loop) that validates candidates against delayed north star business metrics in live production. Our agents act as specialized Machine Learning Engineers (MLEs): they exhibit deep reasoning capabilities, discovering novel improvements in optimization algorithms and model architecture, and formulating innovative reward functions that target long-term user engagement. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through several successful production launches at YouTube, confirming that autonomous, LLM-driven evolution can surpass traditional engineering workflows in both development velocity and model performance.

*Amir Asiaee,Chao Yan,Zachary B. Abrams,Bradley A. Malin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM is a differentially private synthetic data generation method that optimizes for specific prediction tasks by selectively allocating privacy budget to relevant features based on available structural knowledge (causal, graphical, or predictive regimes).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DP synthetic data methods treat all features symmetrically, spreading noise uniformly even when the data serves a specific prediction task. This leads to unnecessary noise accumulation and poor prediction performance.

Method: PRISM operates in three regimes: (1) Causal regime - targets causal parents of Y when known and distribution shift expected; (2) Graphical regime - uses Markov blanket of Y when Bayesian network structure available; (3) Predictive regime - selects features via DP methods when no structural knowledge exists. It identifies predictive feature subsets, constructs targeted summary statistics, allocates budget to minimize prediction error, and synthesizes data via graphical-model inference.

Result: Task-aware allocation improves prediction accuracy compared to generic synthesizers. Under distribution shift, targeting causal parents achieves AUC ≈ 0.73 while correlation-based selection collapses to chance (≈ 0.49).

Conclusion: PRISM provides a prediction-centric approach to DP synthetic data generation that adapts to available structural knowledge, offering improved prediction performance while maintaining privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides a mathematical guarantee limiting what an adversary can learn about any individual from released data. However, achieving this protection typically requires adding noise, and noise can accumulate when many statistics are measured. Existing DP synthetic data methods treat all features symmetrically, spreading noise uniformly even when the data will serve a specific prediction task.
  We develop a prediction-centric approach operating in three regimes depending on available structural knowledge. In the causal regime, when the causal parents of $Y$ are known and distribution shift is expected, we target the parents for robustness. In the graphical regime, when a Bayesian network structure is available and the distribution is stable, the Markov blanket of $Y$ provides a sufficient feature set for optimal prediction. In the predictive regime, when no structural knowledge exists, we select features via differentially private methods without claiming to recover causal or graphical structure.
  We formalize this as PRISM, a mechanism that (i) identifies a predictive feature subset according to the appropriate regime, (ii) constructs targeted summary statistics, (iii) allocates budget to minimize an upper bound on prediction error, and (iv) synthesizes data via graphical-model inference. We prove end-to-end privacy guarantees and risk bounds. Empirically, task-aware allocation improves prediction accuracy compared to generic synthesizers. Under distribution shift, targeting causal parents achieves AUC $\approx 0.73$ while correlation-based selection collapses to chance ($\approx 0.49$).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large audio language models have difficulty with temporal tasks requiring precise temporal grounding. Standard approaches that generate timestamps as text tokens are computationally expensive and prone to hallucination, especially for audio lengths outside training distribution.

Method: Proposes frame-level internal tool use where audio LMs use their own internal audio representations for temporal grounding. Uses lightweight prediction mechanism trained with two objectives: binary frame classifier and novel inhomogeneous Poisson process (IHP) loss for modeling temporal event intensity.

Result: Outperforms token-based baselines across word localization, speaker diarization, and event localization tasks. Achieves >50x inference speedup and demonstrates robust length generalization, maintaining high accuracy on out-of-distribution audio durations where standard models collapse.

Conclusion: Frame-level internal tool use provides an efficient and robust alternative to token-based temporal grounding, addressing computational and generalization limitations of current audio language models for temporal tasks.

Abstract: Large audio language models are increasingly used for complex audio understanding tasks, but they struggle with temporal tasks that require precise temporal grounding, such as word alignment and speaker diarization. The standard approach, where we generate timestamps as sequences of text tokens, is computationally expensive and prone to hallucination, especially when processing audio lengths outside the model's training distribution. In this work, we propose frame-level internal tool use, a method that trains audio LMs to use their own internal audio representations to perform temporal grounding directly. We introduce a lightweight prediction mechanism trained via two objectives: a binary frame classifier and a novel inhomogeneous Poisson process (IHP) loss that models temporal event intensity. Across word localization, speaker diarization, and event localization tasks, our approach outperforms token-based baselines. Most notably, it achieves a >50x inference speedup and demonstrates robust length generalization, maintaining high accuracy on out-of-distribution audio durations where standard token-based models collapse completely.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Blockwise Advantage Estimation improves GRPO by assigning separate advantages to different text blocks in structured generations, reducing reward interference without needing nested rollouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO assigns a single scalar advantage to all tokens in a completion, which causes reward interference and credit misattribution in structured generations with multiple segments and objectives.

Method: Proposes Blockwise Advantage Estimation with Outcome-Conditioned Baseline - assigns each objective its own advantage applied only to corresponding text blocks, using prefix-derived intermediate outcomes to estimate values without nested rollouts.

Result: On math tasks with uncertainty estimation, the method mitigates reward interference, is competitive with state-of-the-art reward-designed approaches, and preserves test-time gains from confidence-weighted ensembling.

Conclusion: Provides a modular recipe for optimizing sequential objectives in structured generations without additional rollouts, reducing reliance on hand-designed scalar rewards and scaling naturally to additional objectives.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) assigns a single scalar advantage to all tokens in a completion. For structured generations with explicit segments and objectives, this couples unrelated reward signals across segments, leading to objective interference and misattributed credit. We propose Blockwise Advantage Estimation, a family of GRPO-compatible methods that assigns each objective its own advantage and applies it only to the tokens in the corresponding text block, reducing reliance on hand-designed scalar rewards and scaling naturally to additional objectives. A key challenge is estimating advantages for later blocks whose rewards are conditioned on sampled prefixes; standard unbiased approaches require expensive nested rollouts from intermediate states. Concretely, we introduce an Outcome-Conditioned Baseline that approximates intermediate state values using only within-group statistics by stratifying samples according to a prefix-derived intermediate outcome. On math tasks with uncertainty estimation, our method mitigates reward interference, is competitive with a state-of-the-art reward-designed approach, and preserves test-time gains from confidence-weighted ensembling. More broadly, it provides a modular recipe for optimizing sequential objectives in structured generations without additional rollouts.

*Amir Asiaee,Chao Yan,Zachary B. Abrams,Bradley A. Malin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Risk-equalized DP synthesis protects high-risk outliers in synthetic data by downweighting their influence during DP learning, reducing membership inference attacks on vulnerable records.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current differential privacy provides worst-case guarantees but fails to protect outliers (rare disease patients, unusual transactions) from empirical attacks like membership inference, especially under moderate privacy budgets with auxiliary information.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) small privacy budget estimates each record's "outlierness" risk score, (2) DP learning weights each record inversely to its risk score, reducing outliers' influence on the generator. Uses Gaussian mechanisms where privacy loss is proportional to influence.

Result: Proves end-to-end DP guarantees via composition with closed-form per-record bounds. Experiments show risk-weighting substantially reduces membership inference success against high-outlierness records in simulated data. Real-world benchmarks (Breast Cancer, Adult, German Credit) show dataset-dependent gains.

Conclusion: Risk-equalized DP synthesis effectively prioritizes protection for high-risk records by targeting downweighting, not random reduction, providing tighter per-instance privacy bounds for vulnerable outliers while maintaining overall DP guarantees.

Abstract: When synthetic data is released, some individuals are harder to protect than others. A patient with a rare disease combination or a transaction with unusual characteristics stands out from the crowd. Differential privacy provides worst-case guarantees, but empirical attacks -- particularly membership inference -- succeed far more often against such outliers, especially under moderate privacy budgets and with auxiliary information.
  This paper introduces risk-equalized DP synthesis, a framework that prioritizes protection for high-risk records by reducing their influence on the learned generator. The mechanism operates in two stages: first, a small privacy budget estimates each record's "outlierness"; second, a DP learning procedure weights each record inversely to its risk score. Under Gaussian mechanisms, a record's privacy loss is proportional to its influence on the output -- so deliberately shrinking outliers' contributions yields tighter per-instance privacy bounds for precisely those records that need them most.
  We prove end-to-end DP guarantees via composition and derive closed-form per-record bounds for the synthesis stage (the scoring stage adds a uniform per-record term). Experiments on simulated data with controlled outlier injection show that risk-weighting substantially reduces membership inference success against high-outlierness records; ablations confirm that targeting -- not random downweighting -- drives the improvement. On real-world benchmarks (Breast Cancer, Adult, German Credit), gains are dataset-dependent, highlighting the interplay between scorer quality and synthesis pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create personalized exercise recommendations for programming students by accurately modeling their skills across different programming topics and matching them to appropriate homework problems.

Method: Use source code embeddings to model students' programming skills, create student profiles and problem skill vectors, compute cosine similarity between them, and rank exercises based on alignment with student abilities.

Result: Jina embeddings outperformed TF-IDF, CodeBERT-cpp, and GraphCodeBERT for skill prediction. The system produced more suitable recommendations than correctness or solution time baselines across seven course offerings.

Conclusion: Predicted programming skills from source code embeddings provide a stronger signal for exercise recommendation than traditional metrics, enabling more effective personalized learning in programming courses.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a context-aware recommender system that models students' programming skills using embeddings of the source code they submit throughout a course. These embeddings predict students' skills across multiple programming topics, producing profiles that are matched to the skills required by unseen homework problems. To generate recommendations, we compute the cosine similarity between student profiles and problem skill vectors, ranking exercises according to their alignment with each student's current abilities. We evaluated our approach using real data from students and exercises in an introductory programming course at our university. First, we assessed the effectiveness of our source code embeddings for predicting skills, comparing them with token-based and graph-based alternatives. Results showed that Jina embeddings outperformed TF-IDF, CodeBERT-cpp, and GraphCodeBERT across most skills. Additionally, we evaluated the system's ability to recommend exercises aligned with weekly course content by analyzing student submissions collected over seven course offerings. Our approach consistently produced more suitable recommendations than baselines based on correctness or solution time, indicating that predicted programming skills provide a stronger signal for problem recommendation.

*Qiyuan Shi,Jian Kang,Yi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLIMARK extends multiple kernel learning to handle exponential family outcomes, enabling broader data type support and practical application to medical prediction tasks like COVID-19 ICU escalation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single kernel methods are limited by using only one kernel type, which may not capture complex real-world data heterogeneity. Traditional multiple kernel learning (MKL) only handles continuous outcomes, leaving a gap for other data types in the exponential family.

Method: Proposed GLIMARK (generalized linear models with integrated multiple additive regression with kernels) extends MKL to accommodate outcome variables belonging to the exponential family, allowing composite kernels from simpler ones to integrate heterogeneous data sources.

Result: GLIMARK effectively recovers or approximates the true data-generating mechanism. Applied to COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, it successfully predicts binary ICU escalation outcomes and extracts clinically meaningful features.

Conclusion: GLIMARK successfully extends MKL to exponential family outcomes, demonstrating practical utility in real-world medical applications and overcoming limitations of traditional kernel methods for diverse data types.

Abstract: Kernel methods have been extensively utilized in machine learning for classification and prediction tasks due to their ability to capture complex non-linear data patterns. However, single kernel approaches are inherently limited, as they rely on a single type of kernel function (e.g., Gaussian kernel), which may be insufficient to fully represent the heterogeneity or multifaceted nature of real-world data. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) addresses these limitations by constructing composite kernels from simpler ones and integrating information from heterogeneous sources. Despite these advances, traditional MKL methods are primarily designed for continuous outcomes. We extend MKL to accommodate the outcome variable belonging to the exponential family, representing a broader variety of data types, and refer to our proposed method as generalized linear models with integrated multiple additive regression with kernels (GLIMARK). Empirically, we demonstrate that GLIMARK can effectively recover or approximate the true data-generating mechanism. We have applied it to a COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, predicting binary outcomes of ICU escalation and extracting clinically meaningful features, underscoring the practical utility of this approach in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with quantitative causal reasoning in continuous domains; Linear-LLM-SCM framework benchmarks their ability to estimate effect sizes in linear Gaussian SCMs when DAG is given.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show promise in identifying qualitative causal relations, their capability for quantitative causal reasoning (estimating effect sizes in continuous domains) remains underexplored and needs systematic evaluation.

Method: Developed Linear-LLM-SCM, a plug-and-play benchmarking framework that decomposes DAGs into local parent-child sets, prompts LLMs to produce regression-style structural equations per node, then aggregates and compares against ground-truth parameters.

Result: Experiments reveal challenges: strong stochasticity in results, susceptibility to DAG misspecification via spurious edges, substantial variability in coefficient estimates, and sensitivity to structural/semantic perturbations across models.

Conclusion: LLMs currently have significant limitations as quantitative causal parameterizers; the open-sourced framework enables researchers to easily evaluate LLMs on their own DAGs and domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in identifying qualitative causal relations, but their ability to perform quantitative causal reasoning -- estimating effect sizes that parametrize functional relationships -- remains underexplored in continuous domains. We introduce Linear-LLM-SCM, a plug-and-play benchmarking framework for evaluating LLMs on linear Gaussian structural causal model (SCM) parametrization when the DAG is given. The framework decomposes a DAG into local parent-child sets and prompts an LLM to produce a regression-style structural equation per node, which is aggregated and compared against available ground-truth parameters. Our experiments show several challenges in such benchmarking tasks, namely, strong stochasticity in the results in some of the models and susceptibility to DAG misspecification via spurious edges in the continuous domains. Across models, we observe substantial variability in coefficient estimates for some settings and sensitivity to structural and semantic perturbations, highlighting current limitations of LLMs as quantitative causal parameterizers. We also open-sourced the benchmarking framework so that researchers can utilize their DAGs and any off-the-shelf LLMs plug-and-play for evaluation in their domains effortlessly.

### [108] [What Does Preference Learning Recover from Pairwise Comparison Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10286)
*Rattana Pukdee,Maria-Florina Balcan,Pradeep Ravikumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes what Bradley-Terry preference learning actually recovers when real-world data violates the model's assumptions, providing conditions for when BT is appropriate and identifying factors governing sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world pairwise preference data often violates the Bradley-Terry model assumptions, but it's unclear what BT learning actually recovers in such cases. The paper aims to provide a data-centric foundation for understanding preference learning outcomes.

Method: The authors formalize preference information through conditional preference distribution (CPRD) from triplet comparison data. They analyze conditions when BT is appropriate for modeling CPRD and identify key factors governing sample efficiency.

Result: The paper provides precise conditions for when BT modeling is appropriate and identifies margin and connectivity as the key factors governing sample efficiency in preference learning.

Conclusion: The results offer a theoretical foundation for understanding what preference learning actually recovers from real-world data, especially when data violates standard model assumptions.

Abstract: Pairwise preference learning is central to machine learning, with recent applications in aligning language models with human preferences. A typical dataset consists of triplets $(x, y^+, y^-)$, where response $y^+$ is preferred over response $y^-$ for context $x$. The Bradley--Terry (BT) model is the predominant approach, modeling preference probabilities as a function of latent score differences. Standard practice assumes data follows this model and learns the latent scores accordingly. However, real data may violate this assumption, and it remains unclear what BT learning recovers in such cases. Starting from triplet comparison data, we formalize the preference information it encodes through the conditional preference distribution (CPRD). We give precise conditions for when BT is appropriate for modeling the CPRD, and identify factors governing sample efficiency -- namely, margin and connectivity. Together, these results offer a data-centric foundation for understanding what preference learning actually recovers.

### [109] [Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law with Neural Ansatz](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10300)
*Huaqing Zhang,Kaiyue Wen,Tengyu Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers propose NCPL, a neural scaling law that predicts training performance from full training configurations using LLMs, outperforming configuration-agnostic scaling laws and enabling better hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scaling laws assume optimal hyperparameters, requiring significant tuning effort and sometimes being impossible due to hardware constraints. There's a need for better predictability across broader hyperparameter settings and simpler tuning at scale.

Method: Propose Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law (CPL) parameterized with large language models (LLMs) trained on diverse open-source pretraining logs. This Neural CPL (NCPL) learns mapping from full training configurations to performance.

Result: NCPL achieves 20-40% lower prediction error than Chinchilla law, generalizes to runs using 10x more compute than training data, supports joint tuning of multiple hyperparameters, and extends to loss-curve prediction.

Conclusion: NCPL provides a more flexible and accurate approach to predicting training performance across diverse configurations, enabling better hyperparameter optimization and scaling predictions beyond traditional scaling laws.

Abstract: Researchers build scaling laws to forecast the training performance of expensive large-scale runs with larger model size N and data size D. These laws assume that other training hyperparameters are optimally chosen, which can require significant effort and, in some cases, be impossible due to external hardware constraints. To improve predictability across a broader set of hyperparameters and enable simpler tuning at scale, we propose learning a \textit{Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law} (CPL): a mapping from the \textit{full training configuration} to training performance. Because no simple functional form can express this mapping, we parameterize it with a large language model (LLM), and fit it with diverse open-source pretraining logs across multiple sources, yielding a \textit{Neural} Configuration-to-Performance Scaling Law (NCPL). NCPL accurately predicts how training configurations influence the final pretraining loss, achieving 20-40% lower prediction error than the configuration-agnostic Chinchilla law and generalizing to runs using up to 10 x more compute than any run in the training set. It further supports joint tuning of multiple hyperparameters with performance comparable to hyperparameter scaling law baselines. Finally, NCPL naturally and effectively extends to richer prediction targets such as loss-curve prediction.

*Haoling Wang,Lang Zeng,Tao Sun,Youngjoo Cho,Ying Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ICODeN is an ODE-based neural network for interval-censored survival data that models hazard functions flexibly without requiring proportional hazards assumptions or parametric forms, handling high-dimensional predictors effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survival analysis methods for interval-censored data either rely on strong model assumptions or cannot handle high-dimensional predictors, creating a need for more flexible and scalable approaches.

Method: ICODeN uses ordinary differential equation-based neural networks to model hazard functions through deep neural networks and obtains cumulative hazard by solving ODEs, avoiding proportional hazards assumptions and parametric constraints.

Result: ICODeN achieves satisfactory predictive accuracy across simulations with proportional/non-proportional hazards and linear/nonlinear effects, remains stable with increasing predictors, and demonstrates robust performance in Alzheimer's disease and macular degeneration applications.

Conclusion: ICODeN is a practical assumption-lean tool for interval-censored survival prediction in high-dimensional biomedical settings, effectively handling hundreds to thousands of predictors and supporting data-driven subgroup identification.

Abstract: Predicting time-to-event outcomes when event times are interval censored is challenging because the exact event time is unobserved. Many existing survival analysis approaches for interval-censored data rely on strong model assumptions or cannot handle high-dimensional predictors. We develop ICODEN, an ordinary differential equation-based neural network for interval-censored data that models the hazard function through deep neural networks and obtains the cumulative hazard by solving an ordinary differential equation. ICODEN does not require the proportional hazards assumption or a prespecified parametric form for the hazard function, thereby permitting flexible survival modeling. Across simulation settings with proportional or non-proportional hazards and both linear and nonlinear covariate effects, ICODEN consistently achieves satisfactory predictive accuracy and remains stable as the number of predictors increases. Applications to data from multiple phases of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and to two Age-Related Eye Disease Studies (AREDS and AREDS2) for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) demonstrate ICODEN's robust prediction performance. In both applications, predicting time-to-AD or time-to-late AMD, ICODEN effectively uses hundreds to more than 1,000 SNPs and supports data-driven subgroup identification with differential progression risk profiles. These results establish ICODEN as a practical assumption-lean tool for prediction with interval-censored survival data in high-dimensional biomedical settings.

*Mateo Juliani,Mingxuan Li,Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Automatic learning of reward shaping functions for continuous control from offline datasets, robust to unobserved confounders using causal Bellman equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward shaping accelerates RL training but lacks principled design methods, especially for complex continuous control problems with potential confounding variables in offline datasets.

Method: Uses causal Bellman equation to learn tight upper bound on optimal state values, then applies it as potentials in Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) framework, tested with Soft-Actor-Critic on continuous control benchmarks.

Result: Exhibits strong performance guarantees under unobserved confounders and demonstrates effectiveness on multiple continuous control benchmarks.

Conclusion: Marks a solid first step towards confounding robust continuous control from a causal perspective, with code available for training reward shaping functions.

Abstract: Reward shaping has been applied widely to accelerate Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents' training. However, a principled way of designing effective reward shaping functions, especially for complex continuous control problems, remains largely under-explained. In this work, we propose to automatically learn a reward shaping function for continuous control problems from offline datasets, potentially contaminated by unobserved confounding variables. Specifically, our method builds upon the recently proposed causal Bellman equation to learn a tight upper bound on the optimal state values, which is then used as the potentials in the Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) framework. Our proposed reward shaping algorithm is tested with Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) on multiple commonly used continuous control benchmarks and exhibits strong performance guarantees under unobserved confounders. More broadly, our work marks a solid first step towards confounding robust continuous control from a causal perspective. Code for training our reward shaping functions can be found at https://github.com/mateojuliani/confounding_robust_cont_control.

### [112] [R2RAG-Flood: A reasoning-reinforced training-free retrieval augmentation generation framework for flood damage nowcasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10312)
*Lipai Huang,Kai Yin,Chia-Fu Liu,Ali Mostafavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: R2RAG-Flood is a training-free retrieval-augmented generation framework for post-storm property damage nowcasting that uses reasoning trajectories from similar cases to guide LLM predictions without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a framework for property damage nowcasting that doesn't require task-specific training or fine-tuning, can leverage existing supervised models' knowledge, and provides structured rationales for predictions while maintaining efficiency.

Method: Builds a reasoning-centric knowledge base from labeled tabular records with structured predictors, text summaries, and reasoning trajectories. During inference, retrieves relevant reasoning trajectories from geospatial neighbors and class prototypes, then uses LLMs to emulate prior reasoning in a two-stage prediction process with conditional downgrade correction.

Result: Achieves 0.613-0.668 overall accuracy and 0.757-0.896 damage class accuracy across 7 LLM backbones, approaching supervised baseline's 0.714 overall accuracy. Lightweight variants show substantially higher severity-per-cost efficiency than both supervised baseline and larger LLMs.

Conclusion: R2RAG-Flood provides a training-free approach to property damage nowcasting that approaches supervised model performance while offering structured rationales and superior cost efficiency, demonstrating the value of reasoning-reinforced retrieval-augmented generation.

Abstract: R2RAG-Flood is a reasoning-reinforced, training-free retrieval-augmented generation framework for post-storm property damage nowcasting. Building on an existing supervised tabular predictor, the framework constructs a reasoning-centric knowledge base composed of labeled tabular records, where each sample includes structured predictors, a compact natural language text-mode summary, and a model-generated reasoning trajectory. During inference, R2RAG-Flood issues context-augmented prompts that retrieve and condition on relevant reasoning trajectories from nearby geospatial neighbors and canonical class prototypes, enabling the large language model backbone to emulate and adapt prior reasoning rather than learn new task-specific parameters. Predictions follow a two-stage procedure that first determines property damage occurrence and then refines severity within a three-level Property Damage Extent categorization, with a conditional downgrade step to correct over-predicted severity. In a case study of Harris County, Texas at the 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code scale, the supervised tabular baseline trained directly on structured predictors achieves 0.714 overall accuracy and 0.859 damage class accuracy for medium and high damage classes. Across seven large language model backbones, R2RAG-Flood attains 0.613 to 0.668 overall accuracy and 0.757 to 0.896 damage class accuracy, approaching the supervised baseline while additionally producing a structured rationale for each prediction. Using a severity-per-cost efficiency metric derived from API pricing and GPU instance costs, lightweight R2RAG-Flood variants demonstrate substantially higher efficiency than both the supervised tabular baseline and larger language models, while requiring no task-specific training or fine-tuning.

*Jaeyeon Kim,Jonathan Geuter,David Alvarez-Melis,Sham Kakade,Sitan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PUMA speeds up masked diffusion model training by aligning training and inference masking patterns, achieving 2.5x faster pretraining for 125M models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have training complexity issues: they train on exponentially large masking patterns, causing computational expense and train-test mismatch between random training masks and structured inference-time unmasking patterns.

Method: Progressive UnMAsking (PUMA) modifies the forward masking process to align training-time and inference-time masking patterns, focusing optimization on inference-aligned masks.

Result: PUMA speeds up pretraining at 125M scale by approximately 2.5x and offers complementary advantages on top of common recipes like autoregressive initialization.

Conclusion: PUMA provides a simple yet effective solution to the training complexity and train-test mismatch problems in MDMs, enabling faster training while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete spaces. By generating sequences in any order and allowing for parallel decoding, they enable fast inference and strong performance on non-causal tasks. However, this flexibility comes with a training complexity trade-off: MDMs train on an exponentially large set of masking patterns, which is not only computationally expensive, but also creates a train--test mismatch between the random masks used in training and the highly structured masks induced by inference-time unmasking. In this work, we propose Progressive UnMAsking (PUMA), a simple modification of the forward masking process that aligns training-time and inference-time masking patterns, thereby focusing optimization on inference-aligned masks and speeding up training. Empirically, PUMA speeds up pretraining at the 125M scale by $\approx 2.5\times$ and offers complementary advantages on top of common recipes like autoregressive initialization. We open-source our codebase at https://github.com/JaeyeonKim01/PUMA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI system extracts behavioral nudges from biomedical literature using hybrid filtering and LLM classification, achieving 67% F1 for discovery and 100% precision for high-trust applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavioral nudges are effective for health outcomes but difficult to identify from PubMed's 8+ million articles, creating a bottleneck for evidence-based intervention development.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline: 1) Hybrid filtering (keywords, TF-IDF, cosine similarity, nudge-term bonus) reduces corpus to ~81k candidates; 2) OpenScholar (quantized LLaMA 3.1 8B) classifies papers and extracts structured fields in single pass with JSON schema validation.

Result: Best configuration (Title/Abstract/Intro) achieved 67.0% F1 and 72.0% recall for discovery; high-precision variant with self-consistency (7 randomized passes) achieved 100% precision with 12% recall, showing tunable trade-off.

Conclusion: System demonstrates interpretable, domain-specific retrieval pipelines for evidence synthesis, being integrated into Agile Nudge+ platform to ground LLM-generated interventions in peer-reviewed evidence for personalized healthcare.

Abstract: We present a scalable, AI-powered system that identifies and extracts evidence-based behavioral nudges from unstructured biomedical literature. Nudges are subtle, non-coercive interventions that influence behavior without limiting choice, showing strong impact on health outcomes like medication adherence. However, identifying these interventions from PubMed's 8 million+ articles is a bottleneck. Our system uses a novel multi-stage pipeline: first, hybrid filtering (keywords, TF-IDF, cosine similarity, and a "nudge-term bonus") reduces the corpus to about 81,000 candidates. Second, we use OpenScholar (quantized LLaMA 3.1 8B) to classify papers and extract structured fields like nudge type and target behavior in a single pass, validated against a JSON schema.
  We evaluated four configurations on a labeled test set (N=197). The best setup (Title/Abstract/Intro) achieved a 67.0% F1 score and 72.0% recall, ideal for discovery. A high-precision variant using self-consistency (7 randomized passes) achieved 100% precision with 12% recall, demonstrating a tunable trade-off for high-trust use cases. This system is being integrated into Agile Nudge+, a real-world platform, to ground LLM-generated interventions in peer-reviewed evidence. This work demonstrates interpretable, domain-specific retrieval pipelines for evidence synthesis and personalized healthcare.

*Haixu Liao,Yating Zhou,Songyang Zhang,Meng Wang,Shuai Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis shows contrastive learning with Transformers under imbalanced data evolves through three neuron weight stages, with minority features reducing capacity and hindering feature separation, while pruning can restore performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive learning lacks theoretical understanding under imbalanced data distributions, which are common in real-world applications and can degrade representation quality and cause biased model behavior.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework to analyze training dynamics of contrastive learning with Transformer-based encoders under imbalanced data, examining neuron weight evolution through three distinct stages.

Result: Revealed three-stage neuron weight evolution with different dynamics for majority features, minority features, and noise; minority features reduce representational capacity, increase architectural complexity needs, and hinder feature separation from noise.

Conclusion: Pruning can restore performance degraded by imbalance and enhance feature separation, providing both theoretical insights and practical guidance for contrastive learning under imbalanced data.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful framework for learning generalizable representations, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited, particularly under imbalanced data distributions that are prevalent in real-world applications. Such an imbalance can degrade representation quality and induce biased model behavior, yet a rigorous characterization of these effects is lacking. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the training dynamics of contrastive learning with Transformer-based encoders under imbalanced data. Our results reveal that neuron weights evolve through three distinct stages of training, with different dynamics for majority features, minority features, and noise. We further show that minority features reduce representational capacity, increase the need for more complex architectures, and hinder the separation of ground-truth features from noise. Inspired by these neuron-level behaviors, we show that pruning restores performance degraded by imbalance and enhances feature separation, offering both conceptual insights and practical guidance. Major theoretical findings are validated through numerical experiments.

*Elias Kempf,Simon Schrodi,Bartosz Cywiński,Thomas Brox,Neel Nanda,Arthur Conmy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper proposes evaluation metrics for model diffing methods, compares LLM-based vs SAE-based approaches, finds improved LLM baseline performs comparably to SAE while surfacing more abstract behavioral differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM evaluations miss unexpected behavioral differences between model revisions. Model diffing addresses this but lacks systematic comparison and established evaluation criteria for existing approaches.

Method: Proposes evaluation metrics for key desiderata: generalization, interestingness, and abstraction level. Uses these metrics to compare LLM-based methods (including improved baseline) and sparse autoencoder (SAE)-based methods for model diffing.

Result: Improved LLM-based baseline performs comparably to SAE-based method in model diffing. LLM-based approach typically surfaces more abstract behavioral differences between model versions.

Conclusion: Establishes evaluation framework for model diffing methods, demonstrates comparable performance between improved LLM-based and SAE-based approaches, with LLM methods offering more abstract behavioral insights.

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluations only test capabilities or dispositions that evaluators designed them for, missing unexpected differences such as behavioral shifts between model revisions or emergent misaligned tendencies. Model diffing addresses this limitation by automatically surfacing systematic behavioral differences. Recent approaches include LLM-based methods that generate natural language descriptions and sparse autoencoder (SAE)-based methods that identify interpretable features. However, no systematic comparison of these approaches exists nor are there established evaluation criteria. We address this gap by proposing evaluation metrics for key desiderata (generalization, interestingness, and abstraction level) and use these to compare existing methods. Our results show that an improved LLM-based baseline performs comparably to the SAE-based method while typically surfacing more abstract behavioral differences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a hardware-software co-design framework for Vision-Language-Action Models that establishes scaling laws linking architectural hyperparameters to both accuracy and inference latency, enabling efficient on-device LLM deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLAs are increasingly deployed in resource-constrained on-device settings (autonomous vehicles, robots, smart spaces) where selecting appropriate LLM backbones requires balancing accuracy with strict latency and hardware efficiency constraints. Hardware-software co-design becomes essential as each hardware platform demands tailored architectural solutions.

Method: Proposes a hardware co-design law that jointly captures model accuracy and inference performance: 1) Models training loss as explicit function of architectural hyperparameters, 2) Characterizes inference latency via roofline modeling, 3) Empirically evaluates 1,942 candidate architectures on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, training 170 selected models for 10B tokens each to fit scaling laws, 4) Couples scaling law with latency modeling to establish accuracy-latency correspondence and identify Pareto frontier, 5) Formulates architecture search as joint optimization over precision and performance.

Result: Reduces architecture selection from months to days. At same latency as Qwen2.5-0.5B on target hardware, co-designed architecture achieves 19.42% lower perplexity on WikiText-2. Framework identifies feasible design regions under industrial hardware and application budgets.

Conclusion: Presents first principled and operational framework for hardware co-design scaling laws in on-device LLM deployment, enabling efficient selection of LLM architectures tailored to specific hardware constraints while balancing accuracy and latency requirements.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) have emerged as a key paradigm of Physical AI and are increasingly deployed in autonomous vehicles, robots, and smart spaces. In these resource-constrained on-device settings, selecting an appropriate large language model (LLM) backbone is a critical challenge: models must balance accuracy with strict inference latency and hardware efficiency constraints. This makes hardware-software co-design a game-changing requirement for on-device LLM deployment, where each hardware platform demands a tailored architectural solution. We propose a hardware co-design law that jointly captures model accuracy and inference performance. Specifically, we model training loss as an explicit function of architectural hyperparameters and characterise inference latency via roofline modelling. We empirically evaluate 1,942 candidate architectures on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, training 170 selected models for 10B tokens each to fit a scaling law relating architecture to training loss. By coupling this scaling law with latency modelling, we establish a direct accuracy-latency correspondence and identify the Pareto frontier for hardware co-designed LLMs. We further formulate architecture search as a joint optimisation over precision and performance, deriving feasible design regions under industrial hardware and application budgets. Our approach reduces architecture selection from months to days. At the same latency as Qwen2.5-0.5B on the target hardware, our co-designed architecture achieves 19.42% lower perplexity on WikiText-2. To our knowledge, this is the first principled and operational framework for hardware co-design scaling laws in on-device LLM deployment. We will make the code and related checkpoints publicly available.

*Deepak Bastola,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning models, particularly TabNet, effectively identify childhood malnutrition in Nepal using survey data, with maternal education, wealth, and child age as key predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Childhood malnutrition is a major public health concern in Nepal and low-resource settings, but conventional case-finding approaches are labor-intensive and often unavailable in remote areas. There's a need for scalable, efficient screening methods.

Method: Systematically compared 16 machine learning and deep learning algorithms using Nepal MICS 2019 data. Created a composite malnutrition indicator from stunting, wasting, and underweight status. Evaluated models using 10 metrics with emphasis on F1-score and recall due to class imbalance. Conducted consensus feature importance analysis.

Result: TabNet demonstrated the best performance among all models, outperforming SVM and AdaBoost. Maternal education, household wealth index, and child age were identified as primary predictors, followed by geographic characteristics, vaccination status, and meal frequency.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a scalable, survey-based screening framework for identifying children at elevated risk of malnutrition. The approach supports Nepal's Sustainable Development Goals and offers a transferable methodological template for similar low-resource settings globally.

Abstract: Childhood malnutrition remains a major public health concern in Nepal and other low-resource settings, while conventional case-finding approaches are labor-intensive and frequently unavailable in remote areas. This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of machine learning and deep learning methodologies for identifying malnutrition among children under five years of age in Nepal. We systematically compared 16 algorithms spanning deep learning, gradient boosting, and traditional machine learning families, using data from the Nepal Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019. A composite malnutrition indicator was constructed by integrating stunting, wasting, and underweight status, and model performance was evaluated using ten metrics, with emphasis on F1-score and recall to account for substantial class imbalance and the high cost of failing to detect malnourished children. Among all models, TabNet demonstrated the best performance, likely attributable to its attention-based architecture, and outperformed both support vector machine and AdaBoost classifiers. A consensus feature importance analysis identified maternal education, household wealth index, and child age as the primary predictors of malnutrition, followed by geographic characteristics, vaccination status, and meal frequency. Collectively, these results demonstrate a scalable, survey-based screening framework for identifying children at elevated risk of malnutrition and for guiding targeted nutritional interventions. The proposed approach supports Nepal's progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals and offers a transferable methodological template for similar low-resource settings globally.

*Jia Li,Yu Hou,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LITT is a Timing-Transformer architecture that enables virtual alignment of sequential events on a relative timeline for personalized clinical trajectory analysis, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in predicting cardiotoxicity timing in breast cancer patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models (like transformers) are mostly agnostic to event timing and ordering, bypassing potential causal reasoning in clinical trajectories. There's a need to evaluate "degree of alignment" among patient-specific trajectories and identify shared patterns with consistent event sequences.

Method: LITT (Timing-Transformer) architecture that enables temporary alignment of sequential events on a virtual "relative timeline," allowing event-timing-focused attention and personalized interpretations of clinical trajectories. It treats timing as a computable dimension, assigning relative timestamps to candidate events beyond their observed physical times.

Result: Validated on real-world longitudinal EHR data from 3,276 breast cancer patients to predict onset timing of cardiotoxicity-induced heart disease. Outperformed both benchmark and state-of-the-art survival analysis methods on public datasets.

Conclusion: LITT represents a significant step forward for precision medicine in clinical AI by enabling personalized sequential event discovery with timing-aware attention mechanisms, addressing the limitations of traditional transformers in clinical trajectory analysis.

Abstract: Automatically discovering personalized sequential events from large-scale time-series data is crucial for enabling precision medicine in clinical research, yet it remains a formidable challenge even for contemporary AI models. For example, while transformers capture rich associations, they are mostly agnostic to event timing and ordering, thereby bypassing potential causal reasoning.
  Intuitively, we need a method capable of evaluating the "degree of alignment" among patient-specific trajectories and identifying their shared patterns, i.e., the significant events in a consistent sequence. This necessitates treating timing as a true \emph{computable} dimension, allowing models to assign ``relative timestamps'' to candidate events beyond their observed physical times.
  In this work, we introduce LITT, a novel Timing-Transformer architecture that enables temporary alignment of sequential events on a virtual ``relative timeline'', thereby enabling \emph{event-timing-focused attention} and personalized interpretations of clinical trajectories. Its interpretability and effectiveness are validated on real-world longitudinal EHR data from 3,276 breast cancer patients to predict the onset timing of cardiotoxicity-induced heart disease. Furthermore, LITT outperforms both the benchmark and state-of-the-art survival analysis methods on public datasets, positioning it as a significant step forward for precision medicine in clinical AI.

### [120] [Colorful Talks with Graphs: Human-Interpretable Graph Encodings for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10386)
*Angelo Zangari,Peyman Baghershahi,Sourav Medya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with graph problems due to structural reasoning requirements. The paper introduces a human-interpretable graph encoding method using WL similarity classes mapped to color tokens, showing significant performance improvements on various graph tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph problems pose fundamental challenges for LLMs because they require reasoning over explicit structure, permutation invariance, and complex relationships, which mismatch with LLMs' text-based representations. The paper aims to bridge this gap by finding effective ways to apply LLMs to graph problems despite these barriers.

Method: The method introduces a human-interpretable structural encoding strategy for graph-to-text translation. It computes a variant of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) similarity classes and maps them to human-like color tokens instead of numeric labels. This approach injects graph structure directly into natural language prompts, leveraging the insight that semantically meaningful, human-interpretable cues may be more effectively processed by LLMs than opaque symbolic encoding.

Result: Experimental results on multiple algorithmic and predictive graph tasks show considerable improvements by the proposed method on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The method enhances LLM performance especially on graph tasks that require reasoning over global graph structure by capturing both local and global-range dependencies.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that human-interpretable structural encoding using WL similarity classes mapped to color tokens effectively bridges the gap between LLMs' text processing capabilities and graph reasoning requirements, enabling LLMs to perform better on graph tasks that require understanding of both local and global structural dependencies.

Abstract: Graph problems are fundamentally challenging for large language models (LLMs). While LLMs excel at processing unstructured text, graph tasks require reasoning over explicit structure, permutation invariance, and computationally complex relationships, creating a mismatch with the representations of text-based models. Our work investigates how LLMs can be effectively applied to graph problems despite these barriers. We introduce a human-interpretable structural encoding strategy for graph-to-text translation that injects graph structure directly into natural language prompts. Our method involves computing a variant of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) similarity classes and maps them to human-like color tokens rather than numeric labels. The key insight is that semantically meaningful and human-interpretable cues may be more effectively processed by LLMs than opaque symbolic encoding. Experimental results on multiple algorithmic and predictive graph tasks show the considerable improvements by our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets. By capturing both local and global-range dependencies, our method enhances LLM performance especially on graph tasks that require reasoning over global graph structure.

### [121] [Affordances Enable Partial World Modeling with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10390)

TL;DR: Large language models can serve as partial world models for efficient task planning by leveraging affordance-based knowledge rather than full world simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While large pre-trained models contain extensive world knowledge, using them directly for search-based planning is inefficient and inaccurate. The paper explores whether these models can instead serve as partial world models focused on affordances relevant to user intents.

Method: The authors provide formal proofs that agents achieving task-agnostic, language-conditioned intents must possess predictive partial-world models informed by affordances. They introduce distribution-robust affordances for multi-task settings and show how partial models can be extracted to improve search efficiency.

Result: Empirical evaluations in tabletop robotics tasks demonstrate that affordance-aware partial models reduce search branching factors and achieve higher rewards compared to using full world models.

Conclusion: Large models can effectively serve as partial world models when focused on affordance-based knowledge, leading to more efficient and accurate planning for achieving user intents in complex environments.

Abstract: Full models of the world require complex knowledge of immense detail. While pre-trained large models have been hypothesized to contain similar knowledge due to extensive pre-training on vast amounts of internet scale data, using them directly in a search procedure is inefficient and inaccurate. Conversely, partial models focus on making high quality predictions for a subset of state and actions: those linked through affordances that achieve user intents~\citep{khetarpal2020can}. Can we posit large models as partial world models? We provide a formal answer to this question, proving that agents achieving task-agnostic, language-conditioned intents necessarily possess predictive partial-world models informed by affordances. In the multi-task setting, we introduce distribution-robust affordances and show that partial models can be extracted to significantly improve search efficiency. Empirical evaluations in tabletop robotics tasks demonstrate that our affordance-aware partial models reduce the search branching factor and achieve higher rewards compared to full world models.

*Shaan Pakala,Aldair E. Gongora,Brian Giera,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tensor completion methods outperform traditional ML for material design optimization, offering better interpretability and handling non-uniform data sampling better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional material design optimization faces exponential search space challenges, and ML surrogate models suffer from poor interpretability and performance issues with non-uniform training data.

Method: Use tensor completion methods as surrogate models for material design optimization, leveraging their interpretable tensor factors and specialized variants for non-uniform data sampling.

Result: Tensor methods compete with ML in predictions while providing free interpretable factors that rediscover physical phenomena. Specialized tensor models improve upon ML by up to 5% on aggregate R² and halve error in out-of-distribution regions.

Conclusion: Tensor completion offers an all-in-one solution for material design optimization that combines prediction accuracy with interpretability and robustness to non-uniform data sampling.

Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to tailor the material design (with respect to its design parameters) to have some desired properties (e.g. Young's modulus). As the set of design parameters grow, the search space grows exponentially, making the actual synthesis and evaluation of all material combinations virtually impossible. Even using traditional computational methods such as Finite Element Analysis becomes too computationally heavy to search the design space. Recent methods use machine learning (ML) surrogate models to more efficiently determine optimal material designs; unfortunately, these methods often (i) are notoriously difficult to interpret and (ii) under perform when the training data comes from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We suggest the use of tensor completion methods as an all-in-one approach for interpretability and predictions. We observe classical tensor methods are able to compete with traditional ML in predictions, with the added benefit of their interpretable tensor factors (which are given completely for free, as a result of the prediction). In our experiments, we are able to rediscover physical phenomena via the tensor factors, indicating that our predictions are aligned with the true underlying physics of the problem. This also means these tensor factors could be used by experimentalists to identify potentially novel patterns, given we are able to rediscover existing ones. We also study the effects of both types of surrogate models when we encounter training data from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We observe more specialized tensor methods that can give better generalization in these non-uniforms sampling scenarios. We find the best generalization comes from a tensor model, which is able to improve upon the baseline ML methods by up to 5% on aggregate $R^2$, and halve the error in some out of distribution regions.

TL;DR: LoRA achieves comparable accuracy to full fine-tuning for organic reaction prediction while better preserving general chemical knowledge and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting large language models trained on broad chemistry to smaller, domain-specific reaction datasets is challenging but crucial for chemical/pharmaceutical R&D. Need to learn new reaction knowledge while preserving general chemical understanding across related tasks.

Method: Evaluated Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as parameter-efficient alternative to full fine-tuning for organic reaction prediction on limited datasets (USPTO reaction classes and challenging C-H functionalisation reactions). Benchmarked forward reaction prediction, retrosynthesis, and reagent prediction.

Result: LoRA achieves accuracy comparable to full fine-tuning while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting and better preserving multi-task performance. Both approaches generalize beyond training distributions, producing plausible alternative solvent predictions. C-H functionalisation fine-tuning reveals LoRA and full fine-tuning encode subtly different reactivity patterns, suggesting more effective reaction-specific adaptation with LoRA.

Conclusion: As LLMs continue to scale, modular, parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies like LoRA offer practical solutions for flexible deployment in chemistry applications, balancing specialized adaptation with preservation of general knowledge.

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) trained on broad organic chemistry to smaller, domain-specific reaction datasets is a key challenge in chemical and pharmaceutical R&D. Effective specialisation requires learning new reaction knowledge while preserving general chemical understanding across related tasks. Here, we evaluate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as a parameter-efficient alternative to full fine-tuning for organic reaction prediction on limited, complex datasets. Using USPTO reaction classes and challenging C-H functionalisation reactions, we benchmark forward reaction prediction, retrosynthesis and reagent prediction. LoRA achieves accuracy comparable to full fine-tuning while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting and better preserving multi-task performance. Both fine-tuning approaches generalise beyond training distributions, producing plausible alternative solvent predictions. Notably, C-H functionalisation fine-tuning reveals that LoRA and full fine-tuning encode subtly different reactivity patterns, suggesting more effective reaction-specific adaptation with LoRA. As LLMs continue to scale, our results highlight the practicality of modular, parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for their flexible deployment for chemistry applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Modern AI models excel at advanced math but fail at basic arithmetic like adding multi-digit numbers, with errors mainly due to operand misalignment and carrying failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite AI systems achieving success in complex mathematical tasks like winning math competitions and proving lemmas, they consistently fail at simple arithmetic operations like adding two numbers. This paradox between advanced mathematical reasoning and basic computational ability needs systematic investigation.

Method: The researchers conducted empirical testing of frontier AI models on integer addition tasks, analyzing error patterns as digit count increases. They categorized errors into interpretable classes: operand misalignment and carrying failures, and examined their relationship to tokenization and random failure patterns.

Result: All tested frontier models show significantly degraded accuracy for integer addition as digit count increases. Most errors are interpretable: 87.9% of Claude Opus 4.1 errors, 62.9% of GPT-5 errors, and 92.4% of Gemini 2.5 Pro errors are attributable to operand misalignment or carrying failures. Misalignment errors relate to tokenization, while carrying errors appear as independent random failures.

Conclusion: The arithmetic failure in advanced AI models stems from systematic error patterns rather than random mistakes. Understanding these specific failure modes (operand misalignment and carrying failures) provides insight into fundamental limitations of current AI architectures and suggests targeted improvements for basic computational capabilities.

Abstract: Modern AI systems have been successfully deployed to win medals at international math competitions, assist with research workflows, and prove novel technical lemmas. However, despite their progress at advanced levels of mathematics, they remain stubbornly bad at basic arithmetic, consistently failing on the simple task of adding two numbers. We present a systematic investigation of this phenomenon. We demonstrate empirically that all frontier models suffer significantly degraded accuracy for integer addition as the number of digits increases. Furthermore, we show that most errors made by these models are highly interpretable and can be attributed to either operand misalignment or a failure to correctly carry; these two error classes explain 87.9%, 62.9%, and 92.4% of Claude Opus 4.1, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro errors, respectively. Finally, we show that misalignment errors are frequently related to tokenization, and that carrying errors appear largely as independent random failures.

*Andrei Kanavalau,Carmen Amo Alonso,Sanjay Lall*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TaperNorm replaces standard normalization in Transformers with a method that starts as normal normalization but gradually transitions to fixed scaling that can be folded into adjacent layers, eliminating per-token statistics at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that sample-dependent normalization is essential for Transformer training, and to enable norm-free Transformers by understanding the true role of normalization as scale anchoring rather than per-token statistics.

Method: TaperNorm is introduced as a drop-in replacement for RMSNorm/LayerNorm that behaves like standard normalization early in training, then smoothly transitions to learned sample-independent linear/affine maps via a global gate that decays from 1 to 0, allowing resulting fixed scalings to be folded into adjacent linear projections.

Result: TaperNorm matches normalized baselines while eliminating per-token statistics and enabling layer folding at inference, achieving up to 1.22× higher throughput in last-token logits mode. The paper identifies scale anchoring as normalization's key role and shows a fixed-target auxiliary loss can provide alternative anchoring.

Conclusion: The work takes a step toward norm-free Transformers by showing sample-dependent normalization isn't essential, with scale anchoring being the critical function. TaperNorm enables efficient inference through layer folding while maintaining training stability.

Abstract: Normalization is widely viewed as essential for stabilizing Transformer training. We revisit this assumption for pre-norm Transformers and ask to what extent sample-dependent normalization is needed inside Transformer blocks. We introduce TaperNorm, a drop-in replacement for RMSNorm/LayerNorm that behaves exactly like the standard normalizer early in training and then smoothly tapers to a learned sample-independent linear/affine map. A single global gate is held at $g{=}1$ during gate warmup, used to calibrate the scaling branch via EMAs, and then cosine-decayed to $g{=}0$, at which point per-token statistics vanish and the resulting fixed scalings can be folded into adjacent linear projections. Our theoretical and empirical results isolate scale anchoring as the key role played by output normalization: as a (near) $0$-homogeneous map it removes radial gradients at the output, whereas without such an anchor cross-entropy encourages unbounded logit growth (``logit chasing''). We further show that a simple fixed-target auxiliary loss on the pre-logit residual-stream scale provides an explicit alternative anchor and can aid removal of the final normalization layer. Empirically, TaperNorm matches normalized baselines under identical setups while eliminating per-token statistics and enabling these layers to be folded into adjacent linear projections at inference. On an efficiency microbenchmark, folding internal scalings yields up to $1.22\times$ higher throughput in last-token logits mode. These results take a step towards norm-free Transformers while identifying the special role output normalization plays.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: e²IP is an equivariant evidential deep learning framework for interatomic potentials that models atomic forces and their uncertainty using rotation-equivariant 3×3 covariance tensors, achieving better accuracy-efficiency-reliability balance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification is critical for reliable ML interatomic potentials in molecular dynamics, but existing approaches are computationally expensive or perform poorly. Evidential deep learning offers a single-model solution but faces challenges when extending from scalar to vector-valued atomic forces while maintaining rotational consistency.

Method: Proposed e²IP framework models atomic forces and uncertainty jointly using full 3×3 symmetric positive definite covariance tensors that transform equivariantly under rotations. The backbone-agnostic approach maintains statistical self-consistency and enables single-forward-pass uncertainty estimation.

Result: Experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks show e²IP provides better accuracy-efficiency-reliability balance than non-equivariant evidential baselines and ensemble methods. It achieves better data efficiency through fully equivariant architecture while retaining single-model inference efficiency.

Conclusion: e²IP successfully addresses the challenge of extending evidential learning to vector-valued atomic forces with rotational equivariance, offering a practical and theoretically grounded uncertainty quantification solution for ML interatomic potentials with improved performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is critical for assessing the reliability of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, identifying extrapolation regimes and enabling uncertainty-aware workflows such as active learning for training dataset construction. Existing UQ approaches for MLIPs are often limited by high computational cost or suboptimal performance. Evidential deep learning (EDL) provides a theoretically grounded single-model alternative that determines both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a single forward pass. However, extending evidential formulations from scalar targets to vector-valued quantities such as atomic forces introduces substantial challenges, particularly in maintaining statistical self-consistency under rotational transformations. To address this, we propose \textit{Equivariant Evidential Deep Learning for Interatomic Potentials} ($\text{e}^2$IP), a backbone-agnostic framework that models atomic forces and their uncertainty jointly by representing uncertainty as a full $3\times3$ symmetric positive definite covariance tensor that transforms equivariantly under rotations. Experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks show that $\text{e}^2$IP provides a stronger accuracy-efficiency-reliability balance than the non-equivariant evidential baseline and the widely used ensemble method. It also achieves better data efficiency through the fully equivariant architecture while retaining single-model inference efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain imitation learning is valuable when expert data collection is costly, but existing methods are either supervised (requiring explicit alignment) or unsupervised (often unstable). There's a need for a semi-supervised approach that balances stability and data efficiency.

Method: Proposes SS-CDIL algorithm with theoretical justification, using only offline data (few target expert demos + unlabeled imperfect trajectories). Introduces cross-domain loss function for learning inter-domain state-action mappings and adaptive weight function to balance source and target knowledge.

Result: Experiments on MuJoCo and Robosuite show consistent gains over baselines, demonstrating stable and data-efficient policy learning with minimal supervision.

Conclusion: SS-CDIL successfully addresses cross-domain imitation learning with minimal supervision, achieving stable policy transfer through novel cross-domain loss and adaptive weighting, making it practical for real-world applications where expert data is scarce.

Abstract: Cross-domain imitation learning (CDIL) accelerates policy learning by transferring expert knowledge across domains, which is valuable in applications where the collection of expert data is costly. Existing methods are either supervised, relying on proxy tasks and explicit alignment, or unsupervised, aligning distributions without paired data, but often unstable. We introduce the Semi-Supervised CDIL (SS-CDIL) setting and propose the first algorithm for SS-CDIL with theoretical justification. Our method uses only offline data, including a small number of target expert demonstrations and some unlabeled imperfect trajectories. To handle domain discrepancy, we propose a novel cross-domain loss function for learning inter-domain state-action mappings and design an adaptive weight function to balance the source and target knowledge. Experiments on MuJoCo and Robosuite show consistent gains over the baselines, demonstrating that our approach achieves stable and data-efficient policy learning with minimal supervision.

TL;DR: LUCID Attention introduces a preconditioner based on key-key similarities to improve attention focus in long sequences without computational overhead, achieving significant gains on long-context retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard softmax attention diffuses probability mass to irrelevant tokens in long sequences, and attempts to sharpen focus via temperature reduction cause vanishing gradient problems that hinder learnability.

Method: LUCID Attention applies a preconditioner derived from exponentiated key-key similarities to minimize overlap between keys in RKHS, allowing queries to focus on important keys with same computational complexity as standard attention.

Result: Training ~1B parameter models on up to 128K tokens shows significant improvements: up to 18% better on BABILong and 14% better on RULER multi-needle tasks compared to standard attention.

Conclusion: LUCID Attention effectively addresses softmax attention limitations in long sequences through preconditioning, improving retrieval performance without computational overhead or learnability issues.

Abstract: Softmax-based dot-product attention is a cornerstone of Transformer architectures, enabling remarkable capabilities such as in-context learning. However, as context lengths increase, a fundamental limitation of the softmax function emerges: it tends to diffuse probability mass to irrelevant tokens degrading performance in long-sequence scenarios. Furthermore, attempts to sharpen focus by lowering softmax temperature hinder learnability due to vanishing gradients. We introduce LUCID Attention, an architectural modification that applies a preconditioner to the attention probabilities. This preconditioner, derived from exponentiated key-key similarities, minimizes overlap between the keys in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, thus allowing the query to focus on important keys among large number of keys accurately with same computational complexity as standard attention. Additionally, LUCID's preconditioning-based approach to retrieval bypasses the need for low temperature and the learnability problems associated with it. We validate our approach by training ~1 billion parameter language models evaluated on up to 128K tokens. Our results demonstrate significant gains on long-context retrieval tasks, specifically retrieval tasks from BABILong, RULER, SCROLLS and LongBench. For instance, LUCID achieves up to 18% improvement in BABILong and 14% improvement in RULER multi-needle performance compared to standard attention.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRPO uses distributionally robust optimization with hard filtering to prevent model collapse in offline RL recommendation by identifying and recovering high-quality behaviors while discarding noisy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy-based RL for generative recommendation suffers from model collapse when trained on offline historical logs due to dominance of low-quality data, causing negative gradient updates to trigger exponential intensity explosion.

Method: Proposes Distributionally Robust Policy Optimization (DRPO) that reformulates the objective as an Optimistic Distributionally Robust Optimization problem, using hard filtering as the exact solution to recover high-quality behaviors while discarding divergence-inducing noise.

Result: DRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on mixed-quality recommendation benchmarks by preventing model collapse and optimally recovering high-quality behaviors.

Conclusion: The key to solving offline RL recommendation's model collapse problem is identifying latent high-quality distributions within noisy behavior policies through distributionally robust optimization with hard filtering, which DRPO successfully implements.

Abstract: Policy-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) has established itself as the dominant paradigm in generative recommendation for optimizing sequential user interactions. However, when applied to offline historical logs, these methods suffer a critical failure: the dominance of low-quality data induces severe model collapse. We first establish the Divergence Theory of Repulsive Optimization, revealing that negative gradient updates inherently trigger exponential intensity explosion during off-policy training. This theory elucidates the inherent dilemma of existing methods, exposing their inability to reconcile variance reduction and noise imitation. To break this curse, we argue that the solution lies in rigorously identifying the latent high-quality distribution entangled within the noisy behavior policy. Accordingly, we reformulate the objective as an Optimistic Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) problem. Guided by this formulation, we propose Distributionally Robust Policy Optimization (DRPO). We prove that hard filtering is the exact solution to this DRO objective, enabling DRPO to optimally recover high-quality behaviors while strictly discarding divergence-inducing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on mixed-quality recommendation benchmarks.

TL;DR: LightGTS-Cov extends LightGTS foundation model to better incorporate exogenous covariates through a lightweight MLP plug-in, improving performance in energy forecasting applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series foundation models either ignore exogenous covariates or use simple concatenation, limiting effectiveness in covariate-rich applications like electricity price forecasting and renewable energy forecasting where covariates (weather, dispatch plans) are crucial.

Method: Extends LightGTS (~1M parameters) with a ~0.1M-parameter MLP plug-in that integrates time-aligned covariates by residually refining decoding outputs. Preserves lightweight, period-aware backbone while explicitly incorporating both past and future-known covariates.

Result: Outperforms LightGTS and other covariate-aware baselines on electricity price and energy generation benchmarks. Achieves strong forecasting accuracy and stable operational performance in real-world applications: long-term photovoltaic power forecasting with weather forecasts and day-ahead electricity price forecasting with weather and dispatch-plan covariates.

Conclusion: LightGTS-Cov effectively incorporates covariates through a lightweight extension, demonstrating practical value in real-world industrial energy forecasting applications with superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Time series foundation models are typically pre-trained on large, multi-source datasets; however, they often ignore exogenous covariates or incorporate them via simple concatenation with the target series, which limits their effectiveness in covariate-rich applications such as electricity price forecasting and renewable energy forecasting. We introduce LightGTS-Cov, a covariate-enhanced extension of LightGTS that preserves its lightweight, period-aware backbone while explicitly incorporating both past and future-known covariates. Built on a $\sim$1M-parameter LightGTS backbone, LightGTS-Cov adds only a $\sim$0.1M-parameter MLP plug-in that integrates time-aligned covariates into the target forecasts by residually refining the outputs of the decoding process. Across covariate-aware benchmarks on electricity price and energy generation datasets, LightGTS-Cov consistently outperforms LightGTS and achieves superior performance over other covariate-aware baselines under both settings, regardless of whether future-known covariates are provided. We further demonstrate its practical value in two real-world energy case applications: long-term photovoltaic power forecasting with future weather forecasts and day-ahead electricity price forecasting with weather and dispatch-plan covariates. Across both applications, LightGTS-Cov achieves strong forecasting accuracy and stable operational performance after deployment, validating its effectiveness in real-world industrial settings.

Motivation: Traditional mileage metrics fail to capture mechanical burden, and unsupervised deep learning models conflate statistical stability with mechanical rest, missing high-load steady states like hill climbing with heavy payloads that cause significant drivetrain fatigue.

Method: Proposes a Dual-Stream Architecture that fuses unsupervised learning for surface anomaly detection with macroscopic physics proxies for cumulative load estimation, using low-frequency sensor data to generate multi-dimensional health vectors.

Result: Validated on RISC-V embedded platform, demonstrates low computational overhead enabling comprehensive edge-based health monitoring on resource-constrained ECUs without cloud latency/bandwidth costs.

Conclusion: The dual-stream approach effectively distinguishes between dynamic hazards and sustained mechanical effort, providing comprehensive vehicle health monitoring suitable for edge deployment in commercial fleets.

Abstract: Runtime quantification of vehicle operational intensity is essential for predictive maintenance and condition monitoring in commercial and heavy-duty fleets. Traditional metrics like mileage fail to capture mechanical burden, while unsupervised deep learning models detect statistical anomalies, typically transient surface shocks, but often conflate statistical stability with mechanical rest. We identify this as a critical blind spot: high-load steady states, such as hill climbing with heavy payloads, appear statistically normal yet impose significant drivetrain fatigue. To resolve this, we propose a Dual-Stream Architecture that fuses unsupervised learning for surface anomaly detection with macroscopic physics proxies for cumulative load estimation. This approach leverages low-frequency sensor data to generate a multi-dimensional health vector, distinguishing between dynamic hazards and sustained mechanical effort. Validated on a RISC-V embedded platform, the architecture demonstrates low computational overhead, enabling comprehensive, edge-based health monitoring on resource-constrained ECUs without the latency or bandwidth costs of cloud-based monitoring.

Method: Control Reinforcement Learning (CRL) trains a policy to select SAE features for steering at each token, with Adaptive Feature Masking to encourage diverse feature discovery while preserving single-feature interpretability.

Result: CRL achieves improvements on Gemma-2 2B across MMLU, BBQ, GSM8K, HarmBench, and XSTest while providing per-token intervention logs. The framework enables new analysis capabilities: branch point tracking, critic trajectory analysis, and layer-wise feature comparison.

Conclusion: Learned feature steering establishes a mechanistic interpretability tool that complements static feature analysis with dynamic intervention probes, revealing which features actually influence model outputs.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose language model activations into interpretable features, but existing methods reveal only which features activate, not which change model outputs when amplified. We introduce Control Reinforcement Learning (CRL), which trains a policy to select SAE features for steering at each token, producing interpretable intervention logs: the learned policy identifies features that change model outputs when amplified. Adaptive Feature Masking encourages diverse feature discovery while preserving singlefeature interpretability. The framework yields new analysis capabilities: branch point tracking locates tokens where feature choice determines output correctness; critic trajectory analysis separates policy limitations from value estimation errors; layer-wise comparison reveals syntactic features in early layers and semantic features in later layers. On Gemma-2 2B across MMLU, BBQ, GSM8K, HarmBench, and XSTest, CRL achieves improvements while providing per-token intervention logs.

*Pingbang Hu,Yuzheng Hu,Jiaqi W. Ma,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a unified theory for when random projection preserves influence functions in overparameterized models, addressing limitations of Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and providing guarantees for ridge regularization and structured curvature approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Influence computation via random projection is commonly used in modern overparameterized models but lacks theoretical justification for how sketching behaves under inversion and interacts with regularization techniques like ridge and structured curvature approximations.

Method: Develops a unified theoretical framework analyzing when projection preserves influence functions. Examines three scenarios: 1) unregularized projection requiring injectivity on range(F), 2) regularized projection with ridge regularization governed by effective dimension, and 3) factorized influence for Kronecker-factored curvatures with decoupled sketches. Also analyzes out-of-range test gradients and leakage terms.

Result: Shows that: 1) Unregularized projection exactly preserves influence iff P is injective on range(F), requiring m≥rank(F); 2) Ridge regularization fundamentally changes sketching requirements with guarantees governed by effective dimension; 3) Factorized curvatures maintain guarantees with decoupled sketches despite violating i.i.d. assumptions; 4) Provides leakage analysis for general test points with components in kernel(F).

Conclusion: The work develops a novel theory characterizing when projection provably preserves influence functions, addressing limitations of existing approaches and providing principled guidance for choosing sketch size in practical applications with regularization and structured approximations.

Abstract: Influence functions and related data attribution scores take the form of $g^{\top}F^{-1}g^{\prime}$, where $F\succeq 0$ is a curvature operator. In modern overparameterized models, forming or inverting $F\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ is prohibitive, motivating scalable influence computation via random projection with a sketch $P \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$. This practice is commonly justified via the Johnson--Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma, which ensures approximate preservation of Euclidean geometry for a fixed dataset. However, JL does not address how sketching behaves under inversion. Furthermore, there is no existing theory that explains how sketching interacts with other widely-used techniques, such as ridge regularization and structured curvature approximations.
  We develop a unified theory characterizing when projection provably preserves influence functions. When $g,g^{\prime}\in\text{range}(F)$, we show that: 1) Unregularized projection: exact preservation holds iff $P$ is injective on $\text{range}(F)$, which necessitates $m\geq \text{rank}(F)$; 2) Regularized projection: ridge regularization fundamentally alters the sketching barrier, with approximation guarantees governed by the effective dimension of $F$ at the regularization scale; 3) Factorized influence: for Kronecker-factored curvatures $F=A\otimes E$, the guarantees continue to hold for decoupled sketches $P=P_A\otimes P_E$, even though such sketches exhibit row correlations that violate i.i.d. assumptions. Beyond this range-restricted setting, we analyze out-of-range test gradients and quantify a \emph{leakage} term that arises when test gradients have components in $\ker(F)$. This yields guarantees for influence queries on general test points.
  Overall, this work develops a novel theory that characterizes when projection provably preserves influence and provides principled guidance for choosing the sketch size in practice.

### [135] [Constructing Industrial-Scale Optimization Modeling Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10450)
*Zhong Li,Hongliang Lu,Tao Wei,Wenyu Liu,Yuxuan Chen,Yuan Lan,Fan Zhang,Zaiwen Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MIPLIB-NL is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on translating natural language to optimization code, built from real industrial-scale optimization problems rather than synthetic toy examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation for optimization modeling uses toy/synthetic benchmarks that don't reflect real industrial problems with thousands to millions of variables/constraints. There's a lack of benchmarks aligning natural language specs with reference formulations grounded in real optimization models.

Method: Developed MIPLIB-NL using structure-aware reverse construction from real mixed-integer linear programs in MIPLIB 2017. Pipeline: (1) recovers compact model structure from flat solver formulations, (2) reverse-generates natural-language specs tied to recovered structure using model-data separation, (3) performs iterative semantic validation through expert review and human-LLM interaction with reconstruction checks.

Result: Created 223 one-to-one reconstructions preserving mathematical content while enabling realistic natural-language-to-optimization evaluation. Experiments show substantial performance degradation on MIPLIB-NL for systems that perform well on existing benchmarks, exposing failure modes invisible at toy scale.

Conclusion: MIPLIB-NL fills a critical gap by providing a benchmark grounded in real industrial optimization problems, revealing limitations of current LLM approaches that are masked by existing toy/synthetic benchmarks.

Abstract: Optimization modeling underpins decision-making in logistics, manufacturing, energy, and finance, yet translating natural-language requirements into correct optimization formulations and solver-executable code remains labor-intensive. Although large language models (LLMs) have been explored for this task, evaluation is still dominated by toy-sized or synthetic benchmarks, masking the difficulty of industrial problems with $10^{3}$--$10^{6}$ (or more) variables and constraints. A key bottleneck is the lack of benchmarks that align natural-language specifications with reference formulations/solver code grounded in real optimization models. To fill in this gap, we introduce MIPLIB-NL, built via a structure-aware reverse construction methodology from real mixed-integer linear programs in MIPLIB~2017. Our pipeline (i) recovers compact, reusable model structure from flat solver formulations, (ii) reverse-generates natural-language specifications explicitly tied to this recovered structure under a unified model--data separation format, and (iii) performs iterative semantic validation through expert review and human--LLM interaction with independent reconstruction checks. This yields 223 one-to-one reconstructions that preserve the mathematical content of the original instances while enabling realistic natural-language-to-optimization evaluation. Experiments show substantial performance degradation on MIPLIB-NL for systems that perform strongly on existing benchmarks, exposing failure modes invisible at toy scale.

*Kanghyun Noh,Jinheon Choi,Yulwha Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization for efficient LLM deployment while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require substantial computational and memory resources. While token-adaptive execution reduces FLOPs and quantization reduces memory footprint, naive integration causes accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy in token-adaptive models.

Method: QTALE introduces two key components: (1) a training strategy ensuring diverse execution paths are explored during fine-tuning, and (2) a post-training mechanism allowing flexible adjustment of execution ratio at inference to reintroduce redundancy when needed.

Result: QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization, showing no noticeable accuracy difference, with the gap to quantization-only models kept below 0.5% on CommonsenseQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: By combining token-adaptive execution for FLOPs reduction and quantization for memory savings, QTALE provides an effective solution for efficient LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand substantial computational and memory resources, posing challenges for efficient deployment. Two complementary approaches have emerged to address these issues: token-adaptive layer execution, which reduces floating-point operations (FLOPs) by selectively bypassing layers, and quantization, which lowers memory footprint by reducing weight precision. However, naively integrating these techniques leads to additional accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy in token-adaptive models. We propose QTALE (Quantization-Robust Token-Adaptive Layer Execution for LLMs), a novel framework that enables seamless integration of token-adaptive execution with quantization while preserving accuracy. Conventional token-adaptive methods reduce redundancy in two ways: (1) by limiting the diversity of training paths explored during fine-tuning, and (2) by lowering the number of parameters actively involved in inference. To overcome these limitations, QTALE introduces two key components: (1) a training strategy that ensures diverse execution paths are actively explored during fine-tuning, and (2) a post-training mechanism that allows flexible adjustment of the execution ratio at inference to reintroduce redundancy when needed. Experimental results show that QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization, showing no noticeable accuracy difference, with the gap to quantization-only models kept below 0.5% on CommonsenseQA benchmarks. By combining token-adaptive execution for FLOPs reduction and quantization for memory savings, QTALE provides an effective solution for efficient LLM deployment.

*Yili Shen,Xiangliang Zhang*

TL;DR: LatentRxnFlow: A new reaction prediction paradigm that models reactions as continuous latent trajectories using Conditional Flow Matching, achieving SOTA accuracy while providing trajectory-level diagnostics and uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reaction prediction models are either one-shot mappings (limited insight into reaction process) or stepwise generation (requires mechanism-specific supervision, discrete edits, computationally expensive). There's a need for models that combine accuracy with transparency and diagnosability.

Method: Proposes LatentRxnFlow using Conditional Flow Matching to learn time-dependent latent dynamics from standard reactant-product pairs without mechanistic annotations. Models reactions as continuous latent trajectories anchored at thermodynamic product state.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO benchmarks. Enables trajectory-level diagnostics to localize failure modes and mitigate errors via gated inference. Provides intrinsic epistemic uncertainty signals from geometric properties of learned trajectories.

Conclusion: LatentRxnFlow combines strong predictive accuracy with improved transparency, diagnosability, and uncertainty awareness, moving reaction prediction toward more trustworthy deployment in high-throughput discovery workflows.

Abstract: Recent advances in reaction prediction have achieved near-saturated accuracy on standard benchmarks (e.g., USPTO), yet most state-of-the-art models formulate the task as a one-shot mapping from reactants to products, offering limited insight into the underlying reaction process. Procedural alternatives introduce stepwise generation but often rely on mechanism-specific supervision, discrete symbolic edits, and computationally expensive inference. In this work, we propose LatentRxnFlow, a new reaction prediction paradigm that models reactions as continuous latent trajectories anchored at the thermodynamic product state. Built on Conditional Flow Matching, our approach learns time-dependent latent dynamics directly from standard reactant-product pairs, without requiring mechanistic annotations or curated intermediate labels. While LatentRxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO benchmarks, more importantly, the continuous formulation exposes the full generative trajectory, enabling trajectory-level diagnostics that are difficult to realize with discrete or one-shot models. We show that latent trajectory analysis allows us to localize and characterize failure modes and to mitigate certain errors via gated inference. Furthermore, geometric properties of the learned trajectories provide an intrinsic signal of epistemic uncertainty, helping prioritize reliably predictable reaction outcomes and flag ambiguous cases for additional validation. Overall, LatentRxnFlow combines strong predictive accuracy with improved transparency, diagnosability, and uncertainty awareness, moving reaction prediction toward more trustworthy deployment in high-throughput discovery workflows.

*Wei Chen,Xingyu Guo,Shuang Li,Zhao Zhang,Yan Zhong,Fuzhen Zhuang,Deqing wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAlign is an adaptive graph domain adaptation framework that automatically identifies and aligns relevant distribution shifts between source and target graphs without manual specification, using a novel Neural Spectral Discrepancy metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Domain Adaptation methods rely on manually selected graph elements and scenario-specific heuristics, making them inflexible and ineffective when dominant distributional shifts vary across different transfer scenarios.

Method: ADAlign introduces Neural Spectral Discrepancy (NSD), a parametric distance that uses neural characteristic functions in the spectral domain to encode feature-structure dependencies. It employs a learnable frequency sampler to adaptively emphasize the most informative spectral components via minimax optimization, enabling automatic identification and joint alignment of relevant discrepancies.

Result: Extensive experiments on 10 datasets and 16 transfer tasks show ADAlign outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while achieving efficiency gains with lower memory usage and faster training.

Conclusion: ADAlign provides a flexible, scenario-aware, and robust solution for Graph Domain Adaptation that automatically adapts to diverse and dynamically evolving distributional shifts without manual intervention.

Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) transfers knowledge from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs but is challenged by complex, multi-faceted distributional shifts. Existing methods attempt to reduce distributional shifts by aligning manually selected graph elements (e.g., node attributes or structural statistics), which typically require manually designed graph filters to extract relevant features before alignment. However, such approaches are inflexible: they rely on scenario-specific heuristics, and struggle when dominant discrepancies vary across transfer scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{ADAlign}, an Adaptive Distribution Alignment framework for GDA. Unlike heuristic methods, ADAlign requires no manual specification of alignment criteria. It automatically identifies the most relevant discrepancies in each transfer and aligns them jointly, capturing the interplay between attributes, structures, and their dependencies. This makes ADAlign flexible, scenario-aware, and robust to diverse and dynamically evolving shifts. To enable this adaptivity, we introduce the Neural Spectral Discrepancy (NSD), a theoretically principled parametric distance that provides a unified view of cross-graph shifts. NSD leverages neural characteristic function in the spectral domain to encode feature-structure dependencies of all orders, while a learnable frequency sampler adaptively emphasizes the most informative spectral components for each task via minimax paradigm. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets and 16 transfer tasks show that ADAlign not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines but also achieves efficiency gains with lower memory usage and faster training.

*Yongzhong Xu*

TL;DR: Transformer training trajectories collapse onto low-dimensional execution manifolds (dimension 3-4) despite high-dimensional parameter spaces, explaining attention concentration, SGD dynamics, and interpretability limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the geometric structure of learning dynamics in overparameterized transformer models, particularly why they work so well despite operating in high-dimensional spaces, and to explain observed phenomena like sharp attention concentration and SGD behavior.

Method: Investigated transformer training dynamics through carefully controlled modular arithmetic tasks, analyzing trajectories in parameter spaces (d=128), examining dimensional collapse, manifold orientation, and projecting SGD dynamics onto execution subspaces.

Result: Training trajectories rapidly collapse onto low-dimensional execution manifolds (dimension 3-4) robustly across random seeds; sharp attention concentration emerges as saturation along routing coordinates; SGD exhibits approximately integrable dynamics on execution subspace; sparse autoencoders capture routing structure but not distributed execution.

Conclusion: Transformer learning occurs in dramatically reduced subspaces despite overparameterization, with most parameters absorbing optimization interference while core computation happens in low-dimensional manifolds, providing a unifying geometric framework for understanding transformer learning with implications for interpretability and training design.

Abstract: We investigate the geometric structure of learning dynamics in overparameterized transformer models through carefully controlled modular arithmetic tasks. Our primary finding is that despite operating in high-dimensional parameter spaces ($d=128$), transformer training trajectories rapidly collapse onto low-dimensional execution manifolds of dimension $3$--$4$. This dimensional collapse is robust across random seeds and moderate task difficulties, though the orientation of the manifold in parameter space varies between runs. We demonstrate that this geometric structure underlies several empirically observed phenomena: (1) sharp attention concentration emerges as saturation along routing coordinates within the execution manifold, (2) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits approximately integrable dynamics when projected onto the execution subspace, with non-integrability confined to orthogonal staging directions, and (3) sparse autoencoders capture auxiliary routing structure but fail to isolate execution itself, which remains distributed across the low-dimensional manifold. Our results suggest a unifying geometric framework for understanding transformer learning, where the vast majority of parameters serve to absorb optimization interference while core computation occurs in a dramatically reduced subspace. These findings have implications for interpretability, training curriculum design, and understanding the role of overparameterization in neural network learning.

TL;DR: DiffGDA: A diffusion-based graph domain adaptation method that models domain transfer as a continuous-time generative process using SDEs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on 14 graph transfer tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph domain adaptation methods use discrete adaptation strategies (intermediate graphs or stepwise alignment) that fail in real-world scenarios where graph structures evolve continuously and nonlinearly. Fixed-step alignment cannot approximate the actual transformation process.

Method: Proposes DiffGDA, a diffusion-based GDA method that models domain adaptation as a continuous-time generative process using stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Uses a domain-aware network to steer the generative process toward the target domain, encouraging the diffusion trajectory to follow an optimal adaptation path. Jointly models structural and semantic transitions.

Result: Theoretically shows convergence to optimal solution bridging source and target domains in latent space. Extensive experiments on 14 graph transfer tasks across 8 real-world datasets demonstrate consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: DiffGDA successfully addresses limitations of discrete adaptation strategies by modeling graph domain adaptation as a continuous diffusion process, providing a more effective approach for real-world scenarios with evolving graph structures.

Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) aims to bridge distribution shifts between domains by transferring knowledge from well-labeled source graphs to given unlabeled target graphs. One promising recent approach addresses graph transfer by discretizing the adaptation process, typically through the construction of intermediate graphs or stepwise alignment procedures. However, such discrete strategies often fail in real-world scenarios, where graph structures evolve continuously and nonlinearly, making it difficult for fixed-step alignment to approximate the actual transformation process. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{DiffGDA}, a \textbf{Diff}usion-based \textbf{GDA} method that models the domain adaptation process as a continuous-time generative process. We formulate the evolution from source to target graphs using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), enabling the joint modeling of structural and semantic transitions. To guide this evolution, a domain-aware network is introduced to steer the generative process toward the target domain, encouraging the diffusion trajectory to follow an optimal adaptation path. We theoretically show that the diffusion process converges to the optimal solution bridging the source and target domains in the latent space. Extensive experiments on 14 graph transfer tasks across 8 real-world datasets demonstrate DiffGDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Chamfer-linkage, a novel linkage function for HAC using Chamfer distance, which consistently outperforms classical linkages across diverse datasets while maintaining O(n²) time complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical HAC linkage functions (single-linkage, average-linkage, Ward's method) show high variability across real-world datasets and don't consistently produce high-quality clusterings. HAC lacks a single explicit global objective, making linkage function choice crucial for practical performance.

Method: Introduces Chamfer-linkage, a novel linkage function that measures distance between clusters using Chamfer distance (popular in ML/CV for point-cloud distance). The method maintains O(n²) time complexity matching classical linkages, making it a practical drop-in replacement.

Result: Chamfer-linkage consistently yields higher-quality clusterings than classical linkages (average-linkage, Ward's method) across diverse datasets. Theoretically proven to have O(n²) time complexity, matching efficiency of classical linkage functions.

Conclusion: Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other linkages struggle with, establishing it as a practical drop-in replacement that broadens the hierarchical clustering toolkit for both theory and practice.

Abstract: Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) is a widely-used clustering method based on repeatedly merging the closest pair of clusters, where inter-cluster distances are determined by a linkage function. Unlike many clustering methods, HAC does not optimize a single explicit global objective; clustering quality is therefore primarily evaluated empirically, and the choice of linkage function plays a crucial role in practice. However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice.
  In this paper, we propose \emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision. We argue that Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other popular measures struggle to satisfy. Theoretically, we show that Chamfer-linkage HAC can be implemented in $O(n^2)$ time, matching the efficiency of classical linkage functions. Experimentally, we find that Chamfer-linkage consistently yields higher-quality clusterings than classical linkages such as average-linkage and Ward's method across a diverse collection of datasets. Our results establish Chamfer-linkage as a practical drop-in replacement for classical linkage functions, broadening the toolkit for hierarchical clustering in both theory and practice.

*Seongwon Jin,Hanseul Choi,Sunggu Yang,Sungho Park,Jibum Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers introduce a new ECoG dataset for Parkinson's disease prediction and propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that addresses inter-subject variability and domain generalization challenges, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECoG offers better spatial resolution than EEG for early PD prediction, but ethical constraints in human studies and lack of open benchmark datasets have limited reproducible comparisons. There's a need for standardized datasets and methods that handle high inter-subject variability and domain generalization challenges.

Method: Proposed Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) with three components: (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation by randomly swapping channels between subjects, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias and learn task-relevant shared features.

Result: Method consistently outperformed all baselines across cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings, with most significant improvements in highly variable environments. Achieved superior cross-dataset performance between public EEG benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization from ECoG to EEG data.

Conclusion: The new ECoG dataset provides the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction, and the SAF framework effectively addresses inter-subject variability and domain generalization challenges, showing promising results for both ECoG and EEG-based brain-computer interface applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (ECoG) offers a promising alternative to conventional electrocorticography (EEG) for the early prediction of Parkinson's disease (PD), providing higher spatial resolution and a broader frequency range. However, reproducible comparisons has been limited by ethical constraints in human studies and the lack of open benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings. Our method consistently outperformed all baselines across all settings, showing the most significant improvements in highly variable environments. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved superior cross-dataset performance between public EEG benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization capability not only within ECoG but to EEG data. The new dataset and source code will be made publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: Physics-informed mixture density networks for multimodal conditional modeling in scientific systems with regime switching and non-unique physical mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many scientific systems exhibit multimodal behavior from latent regime switching and non-unique physical mechanisms, but learning full conditional distributions in a physically consistent and interpretable way remains challenging. Current ML generative models don't integrate well with physics constraints when preserving structure or with limited data.

Method: Develops physics-informed multimodal conditional modeling using mixture density networks (MDNs) with explicit, interpretable parameterization of multimodal distributions. Embeds physical knowledge through component-specific regularization terms that penalize violations of governing equations or physical laws.

Result: Evaluated across scientific problems with intrinsic multimodality (nonlinear dynamical system bifurcations, stochastic PDEs, atomistic shock dynamics). Compared with conditional flow matching (CFM), showing MDNs achieve competitive performance with simpler, more interpretable formulation.

Conclusion: MDNs provide effective physics-informed multimodal modeling that accommodates non-uniqueness and stochasticity while remaining computationally efficient and interpretable, offering advantages over more complex generative approaches like CFM.

Abstract: Many scientific and engineering systems exhibit intrinsically multimodal behavior arising from latent regime switching and non-unique physical mechanisms. In such settings, learning the full conditional distribution of admissible outcomes in a physically consistent and interpretable manner remains a challenge. While recent advances in machine learning have enabled powerful multimodal generative modeling, their integration with physics-constrained scientific modeling remains nontrivial, particularly when physical structure must be preserved or data are limited. This work develops a physics-informed multimodal conditional modeling framework based on mixture density representations. Mixture density networks (MDNs) provide an explicit and interpretable parameterization of multimodal conditional distributions. Physical knowledge is embedded through component-specific regularization terms that penalize violations of governing equations or physical laws. This formulation naturally accommodates non-uniqueness and stochasticity while remaining computationally efficient and amenable to conditioning on contextual inputs. The proposed framework is evaluated across a range of scientific problems in which multimodality arises from intrinsic physical mechanisms rather than observational noise, including bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems, stochastic partial differential equations, and atomistic-scale shock dynamics. In addition, the proposed method is compared with a conditional flow matching (CFM) model, a representative state-of-the-art generative modeling approach, demonstrating that MDNs can achieve competitive performance while offering a simpler and more interpretable formulation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a principled method for model upscaling that ensures equivalence between original and widened models, and extends μTransfer theory for efficient hyperparameter tuning in upscaled models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model upscaling methods for transferring knowledge from smaller to larger models are sensitive to hyperparameters that need tuning at target sizes, which is prohibitively expensive. The common workaround of tuning on smaller models and extrapolating via scaling laws may not be reliable with upscaling.

Method: 1) Introduces a general upscaling method inspired by μP and any-dimensional architectures, applicable to diverse architectures and optimizers, with theoretical guarantees of equivalence between original and widened models. 2) Extends μTransfer theory to create a hyperparameter transfer technique specifically for upscaled models.

Result: The method is theoretically backed to ensure model equivalence and enable rigorous analysis of infinite-width limits. Empirically demonstrated to be effective on realistic datasets and architectures for efficient hyperparameter tuning in upscaled models.

Conclusion: The paper provides principled approaches to model upscaling that address the hyperparameter sensitivity problem, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness for transferring knowledge from smaller to larger neural networks efficiently.

Abstract: Modern large-scale neural networks are often trained and released in multiple sizes to accommodate diverse inference budgets. To improve efficiency, recent work has explored model upscaling: initializing larger models from trained smaller ones in order to transfer knowledge and accelerate convergence. However, this method can be sensitive to hyperparameters that need to be tuned at the target upscaled model size, which is prohibitively costly to do directly. It remains unclear whether the most common workaround -- tuning on smaller models and extrapolating via hyperparameter scaling laws -- is still sound when using upscaling. We address this with principled approaches to upscaling with respect to model widths and efficiently tuning hyperparameters in this setting. First, motivated by $μ$P and any-dimensional architectures, we introduce a general upscaling method applicable to a broad range of architectures and optimizers, backed by theory guaranteeing that models are equivalent to their widened versions and allowing for rigorous analysis of infinite-width limits. Second, we extend the theory of $μ$Transfer to a hyperparameter transfer technique for models upscaled using our method and empirically demonstrate that this method is effective on realistic datasets and architectures.

*Brian Hyeongseok Kim,Jacqueline L. Mitchell,Chao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to find counterfactual training datasets (rather than input perturbations) that would change a model's prediction, enabling analysis of how label bias affects predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current counterfactual explanation methods focus on perturbing inputs, but this approach explores how training data bias affects model predictions. The goal is to assess fairness by analyzing how label bias propagates through training to inference.

Method: The method heuristically ranks and modifies a bounded number of training labels to construct counterfactual datasets, retrains models on these altered datasets, and checks if predictions on test cases change. It traces how bias propagates through learning algorithms.

Result: Evaluation on 7 fairness datasets with over 1100 test cases shows the method modifies only small subsets of training labels, pinpointing critical training examples that drive prediction changes. It reveals connections between training examples and test cases.

Conclusion: The counterfactual dataset approach provides an interpretable way to probe dataset bias and assess fairness by directly analyzing how label bias influences training and inference, offering new insights beyond traditional input perturbation methods.

Abstract: Interpreting the inference-time behavior of deep neural networks remains a challenging problem. Existing approaches to counterfactual explanation typically ask: What is the closest alternative input that would alter the model's prediction in a desired way? In contrast, we explore counterfactual datasets. Rather than perturbing the input, our method efficiently finds the closest alternative training dataset, one that differs from the original dataset by changing a few labels. Training a new model on this altered dataset can then lead to a different prediction of a given test instance. This perspective provides a new way to assess fairness by directly analyzing the influence of label bias on training and inference. Our approach can be characterized as probing whether a given prediction depends on biased labels. Since exhaustively enumerating all possible alternate datasets is infeasible, we develop analysis techniques that trace how bias in the training data may propagate through the learning algorithm to the trained network. Our method heuristically ranks and modifies the labels of a bounded number of training examples to construct a counterfactual dataset, retrains the model, and checks whether its prediction on a chosen test case changes. We evaluate our approach on feedforward neural networks across over 1100 test cases from 7 widely-used fairness datasets. Results show that it modifies only a small subset of training labels, highlighting its ability to pinpoint the critical training examples that drive prediction changes. Finally, we demonstrate how our counterfactual datasets reveal connections between training examples and test cases, offering an interpretable way to probe dataset bias.

TL;DR: The paper develops a robust ECG encoder for multimodal medical AI using SigLIP with modified loss functions, achieving improved multi-label ECG classification on real-world hospital data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs like MedGemini have limited ECG performance, and some (MedGemma) don't support ECG data at all. ECG interpretation is challenging and varies by experience, while echocardiography has accessibility limitations. There's a need for robust ECG encoders for multimodal medical AI.

Method: Use SigLIP (CLIP-based model with sigmoid loss) with modified loss function tailored for multi-label ECG data. Incorporate medical knowledge in language model, increase embedding dimensionality, apply random cropping to mitigate data drift, and conduct per-label analysis.

Result: Modified loss function and medical knowledge incorporation significantly improve multi-label ECG classification. Increased embedding dimensionality and random cropping further enhance performance. Per-label analysis reveals which ECG findings are easier/harder to predict.

Conclusion: Provides foundational framework for developing medical models that utilize ECG data, addressing current limitations in multimodal medical AI's ECG capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the development of multimodal medical AI. While models such as MedGemini achieve high accuracy on VQA tasks like USMLE MM, their performance on ECG based tasks remains limited, and some models, such as MedGemma, do not support ECG data at all. Interpreting ECGs is inherently challenging, and diagnostic accuracy can vary depending on the interpreter's experience. Although echocardiography provides rich diagnostic information, it requires specialized equipment and personnel, limiting its availability. In this study, we focus on constructing a robust ECG encoder for multimodal pretraining using real world hospital data. We employ SigLIP, a CLIP based model with a sigmoid based loss function enabling multi label prediction, and introduce a modified loss function tailored to the multi label nature of ECG data. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating medical knowledge in the language model and applying the modified loss significantly improve multi label ECG classification. To further enhance performance, we increase the embedding dimensionality and apply random cropping to mitigate data drift. Finally, per label analysis reveals which ECG findings are easier or harder to predict. Our study provides a foundational framework for developing medical models that utilize ECG data.

TL;DR: MVGR-Net is a two-stage framework for ride-hailing forecasting that learns geospatial representations from POI and mobility patterns, then uses prompt-empowered LLMs with external event integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ride-hailing services have transformed urban mobility, making accurate forecasting crucial for passenger experience and transportation efficiency, but existing methods struggle with geospatial heterogeneity and sensitivity to external events.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Pretraining learns comprehensive geospatial representations by integrating Points-of-Interest and temporal mobility patterns from semantic attribute and temporal mobility views; 2) Forecasting uses prompt-empowered framework to fine-tune Large Language Models while incorporating external events.

Result: Extensive experiments on DiDi's real-world datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in ride-hailing forecasting.

Conclusion: MVGR-Net effectively addresses geospatial heterogeneity and external event challenges in ride-hailing forecasting through multi-view representation learning and LLM integration.

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing services has fundamentally transformed urban mobility patterns, making accurate ride-hailing forecasting crucial for optimizing passenger experience and urban transportation efficiency. However, ride-hailing forecasting faces significant challenges due to geospatial heterogeneity and high susceptibility to external events. This paper proposes MVGR-Net(Multi-View Geospatial Representation Learning), a novel framework that addresses these challenges through a two-stage approach. In the pretraining stage, we learn comprehensive geospatial representations by integrating Points-of-Interest and temporal mobility patterns to capture regional characteristics from both semantic attribute and temporal mobility pattern views. The forecasting stage leverages these representations through a prompt-empowered framework that fine-tunes Large Language Models while incorporating external events. Extensive experiments on DiDi's real-world datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance.

*Sho Sonoda,Shunta Akiyama,Yuya Uezato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretical analysis of LLM-guided theorem proving, showing that hierarchical/cut-aware learners require exponentially less data than flat learners when proofs have reusable structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLM-guided theorem proving works empirically despite worst-case hardness, and to provide theoretical justification for subgoal decomposition in agentic theorem provers.

Method: Model tactic proposal as stochastic policy in finite-horizon deterministic MDP with Lipschitz policies. Analyze problem distributions generated by reference policy with latent proof DAG structure. Derive lower bounds under top-k search with Tsybakov margin conditions.

Result: Main separation result: when cut elimination expands DAG depth D to cut-free tree size Ω(Λ^D) while cut-aware process has size O(λ^D) with λ≪Λ, flat learners require exponentially more data than hierarchical learners.

Conclusion: Provides principled justification for subgoal decomposition in agentic theorem provers, explaining empirical success through theoretical analysis of hierarchical learning benefits.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical analysis of LLM-guided formal theorem proving in interactive proof assistants (e.g., Lean) by modeling tactic proposal as a stochastic policy in a finite-horizon deterministic MDP. To capture modern representation learning, we treat the state and action spaces as general compact metric spaces and assume Lipschitz policies. To explain the gap between worst-case hardness and empirical success, we introduce problem distributions generated by a reference policy $q$, including a latent-variable model in which proofs exhibit reusable cut/lemma/sketch structure represented by a proof DAG. Under a top-$k$ search protocol and Tsybakov-type margin conditions, we derive lower bounds on finite-horizon success probability that decompose into search and learning terms, with learning controlled by sequential Rademacher/covering complexity. Our main separation result shows that when cut elimination expands a DAG of depth $D$ into a cut-free tree of size $Ω(Λ^D)$ while the cut-aware hierarchical process has size $O(λ^D)$ with $λ\llΛ$, a flat (cut-free) learner provably requires exponentially more data than a cut-aware hierarchical learner. This provides a principled justification for subgoal decomposition in recent agentic theorem provers.

TL;DR: PiT-PO is a reinforcement learning framework that evolves LLMs into adaptive generators for symbolic regression, enforcing physical validity and structural parsimony through dual constraints, achieving SOTA performance and discovering novel turbulence models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based symbolic regression approaches treat models as static generators with prompt-level guidance, failing to update internal representations based on search feedback, which leads to physically inconsistent or mathematically redundant expressions.

Method: PiT-PO (Physics-informed Token-regularized Policy Optimization) uses reinforcement learning to evolve LLMs into adaptive generators. It employs a dual-constraint mechanism that enforces hierarchical physical validity while applying token-level penalties to suppress redundant structures.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, successfully discovers novel turbulence models for challenging fluid dynamics problems, and enables small-scale models to outperform closed-source giants.

Conclusion: PiT-PO democratizes access to high-performance scientific discovery by aligning LLMs to produce scientifically consistent and structurally parsimonious equations through adaptive learning with physical constraints.

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to distill mathematical equations from observational data. Recent approaches have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate equation hypotheses, capitalizing on their vast pre-trained scientific priors. However, existing frameworks predominantly treat the LLM as a static generator, relying on prompt-level guidance to steer exploration. This paradigm fails to update the model's internal representations based on search feedback, often yielding physically inconsistent or mathematically redundant expressions. In this work, we propose PiT-PO (Physics-informed Token-regularized Policy Optimization), a unified framework that evolves the LLM into an adaptive generator via reinforcement learning. Central to PiT-PO is a dual-constraint mechanism that rigorously enforces hierarchical physical validity while simultaneously applying fine-grained, token-level penalties to suppress redundant structures. Consequently, PiT-PO aligns LLM to produce equations that are both scientifically consistent and structurally parsimonious. Empirically, PiT-PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and successfully discovers novel turbulence models for challenging fluid dynamics problems. We also demonstrate that PiT-PO empowers small-scale models to outperform closed-source giants, democratizing access to high-performance scientific discovery.

*Williams Jonathan,Tureci Esin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLTT is a reinforcement learning framework that distributes rewards across full latent reasoning trajectories in LoopLMs, overcoming limitations of previous methods that only credit final latent states, leading to significant improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard reinforcement learning objectives like GRPO only assign credit to the final latent state in LoopLMs, creating a fundamental mismatch with the model's internal multi-step reasoning process, which has prevented successful RL-based improvement of LoopLM reasoning capabilities.

Method: RLTT (Reward Latent Thought Trajectories) distributes reward across the full latent reasoning trajectory rather than just the final state, providing dense, trajectory-level credit assignment without requiring external verifiers, and can directly replace GRPO with minimal overhead.

Result: RLTT yields substantial improvements over GRPO on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Ouro-2.6B-Thinking: +14.4% on MATH-500, +16.6% on AIME24, and +10.0% on BeyondAIME. Despite being trained exclusively on mathematics, RLTT also transfers effectively to non-mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Trajectory-level credit assignment through RLTT is an effective reinforcement learning approach for LoopLMs, overcoming the limitations of final-state-only credit assignment and enabling significant improvements in reasoning performance across both mathematical and non-mathematical domains.

Abstract: Looped Language Models (LoopLMs) perform multi-step latent reasoning prior to token generation and outperform conventional LLMs on reasoning benchmarks at smaller parameter budgets. However, attempts to further improve LoopLM reasoning with reinforcement learning have failed - standard objectives such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) only assign credit to the final latent state, creating a fundamental mismatch with the model's internal computation. To resolve this, we introduce RLTT (Reward Latent Thought Trajectories), a reinforcement learning framework which distributes reward across the full latent reasoning trajectory. RLTT provides dense, trajectory-level credit assignment without relying on external verifiers and can directly replace GRPO with negligible overhead. Across extensive experiments with Ouro-2.6B-Thinking under identical training and inference conditions, RLTT yields substantial improvements over GRPO on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving accuracy by +14.4% on MATH-500, +16.6% on AIME24, and +10.0% on BeyondAIME. Despite being trained exclusively on mathematics, RLTT also transfers effectively to non-mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of trajectory-level credit assignment for reinforcement learning in LoopLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAEs balance interpretability and accuracy using mixture of experts with dynamic gating and targeted regularization, achieving better performance than standard GAMs while maintaining feature-level explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard GAMs are interpretable but limited by strict additivity, while adding feature interactions improves accuracy but reduces interpretability. Need a framework that balances both.

Method: Neural Additive Experts (NAEs) use mixture of experts with multiple specialized networks per feature, dynamic gating to integrate information across features, and targeted regularization to reduce variance among expert predictions.

Result: NAEs achieve optimal balance between predictive accuracy and transparent feature-level explanations, outperforming standard GAMs while maintaining interpretability.

Conclusion: NAEs provide a flexible framework that bridges the gap between interpretability and accuracy, enabling smooth transition from additive models to models capturing feature interactions while preserving clear feature attributions.

Abstract: The trade-off between interpretability and accuracy remains a core challenge in machine learning. Standard Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) offer clear feature attributions but are often constrained by their strictly additive nature, which can limit predictive performance. Introducing feature interactions can boost accuracy yet may obscure individual feature contributions. To address these issues, we propose Neural Additive Experts (NAEs), a novel framework that seamlessly balances interpretability and accuracy. NAEs employ a mixture of experts framework, learning multiple specialized networks per feature, while a dynamic gating mechanism integrates information across features, thereby relaxing rigid additive constraints. Furthermore, we propose targeted regularization techniques to mitigate variance among expert predictions, facilitating a smooth transition from an exclusively additive model to one that captures intricate feature interactions while maintaining clarity in feature attributions. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on synthetic data illustrate the model's flexibility, and extensive evaluations on real-world datasets confirm that NAEs achieve an optimal balance between predictive accuracy and transparent, feature-level explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zeroth-order optimization has biological plausibility and handles non-differentiable objectives, but its computational complexity has limited application in deep neural networks. The conventional layer-by-layer gradient propagation paradigm needs improvement.

Method: Hierarchical Zeroth-Order (HZO) optimization, a novel divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the depth dimension of the network, challenging the conventional layer-by-layer gradient propagation paradigm.

Result: HZO reduces query complexity from O(ML²) to O(ML log L) for networks of width M and depth L. Maintains numerical stability near unitary limit (L_lip ≈ 1). Achieves competitive accuracy on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet compared to backpropagation.

Conclusion: HZO represents a significant leap over existing ZO methodologies, making zeroth-order optimization more practical for deep neural networks while maintaining biological plausibility and handling non-differentiable objectives.

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has long been favored for its biological plausibility and its capacity to handle non-differentiable objectives, yet its computational complexity has historically limited its application in deep neural networks. Challenging the conventional paradigm that gradients propagate layer-by-layer, we propose Hierarchical Zeroth-Order (HZO) optimization, a novel divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the depth dimension of the network. We prove that HZO reduces the query complexity from $O(ML^2)$ to $O(ML \log L)$ for a network of width $M$ and depth $L$, representing a significant leap over existing ZO methodologies. Furthermore, we provide a detailed error analysis showing that HZO maintains numerical stability by operating near the unitary limit ($L_{lip} \approx 1$). Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate that HZO achieves competitive accuracy compared to backpropagation.

TL;DR: DAWN addresses value learning bottlenecks in residual RL through data-anchored warmup and normalization, achieving substantial efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Residual RL enables stable online refinement of pretrained policies, but value learning in this framework faces unique challenges that remain poorly understood, particularly cold start pathology and structural scale mismatch.

Method: Proposes DAWN (Data-Anchored Warmup and Normalization) - a minimal approach using base-policy transitions as value anchors for implicit warmup and critic normalization to restore representation sensitivity for discerning value differences.

Result: DAWN demonstrates substantial efficiency gains across diverse benchmarks, policy architectures, and observation modalities by effectively addressing the identified bottlenecks.

Conclusion: Simple yet principled solutions (base-policy transitions as value anchors and critic normalization) suffice to overcome key bottlenecks in residual RL value learning, enabling more efficient online policy refinement.

Abstract: Residual reinforcement learning (RL) enables stable online refinement of expressive pretrained policies by freezing the base and learning only bounded corrections. However, value learning in residual RL poses unique challenges that remain poorly understood. In this work, we identify two key bottlenecks: cold start pathology, where the critic lacks knowledge of the value landscape around the base policy, and structural scale mismatch, where the residual contribution is dwarfed by the base action. Through systematic investigation, we uncover the mechanisms underlying these bottlenecks, revealing that simple yet principled solutions suffice: base-policy transitions serve as an essential value anchor for implicit warmup, and critic normalization effectively restores representation sensitivity for discerning value differences. Based on these insights, we propose DAWN (Data-Anchored Warmup and Normalization), a minimal approach targeting efficient value learning in residual RL. By addressing these bottlenecks, DAWN demonstrates substantial efficiency gains across diverse benchmarks, policy architectures, and observation modalities.

TL;DR: BNRM is a Bayesian non-negative reward modeling framework that uses sparse latent factors to prevent reward hacking and improve robustness in LLM alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models from human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking due to noisy annotations and systematic biases like response length or style, which undermines LLM alignment through reinforcement learning.

Method: Integrates non-negative factor analysis into Bradley-Terry preference model with sparse, non-negative latent factor generative process. Uses instance-specific latent variables for disentangled reward representations and global latent factor sparsity for implicit debiasing. Employs amortized variational inference network conditioned on deep model representations for efficient end-to-end training.

Result: BNRM substantially mitigates reward over-optimization, improves robustness under distribution shifts, and yields more interpretable reward decompositions compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: BNRM provides a principled framework for robust uncertainty-aware reward learning that addresses key vulnerabilities in current reward modeling approaches for LLM alignment.

Abstract: Reward models learned from human preferences are central to aligning large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning from human feedback, yet they are often vulnerable to reward hacking due to noisy annotations and systematic biases such as response length or style. We propose Bayesian Non-Negative Reward Model (BNRM), a principled reward modeling framework that integrates non-negative factor analysis into Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model. BNRM represents rewards through a sparse, non-negative latent factor generative process that operates at two complementary levels: instance-specific latent variables induce disentangled reward representations, while sparsity over global latent factors acts as an implicit debiasing mechanism that suppresses spurious correlations. Together, this disentanglement-then-debiasing structure enables robust uncertainty-aware reward learning. To scale BNRM to modern LLMs, we develop an amortized variational inference network conditioned on deep model representations, allowing efficient end-to-end training. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that BNRM substantially mitigates reward over-optimization, improves robustness under distribution shifts, and yields more interpretable reward decompositions than strong baselines.

TL;DR: A hybrid architecture separates EEG measurement extraction from text generation to achieve clinical-level accuracy in automated EEG reports, overcoming LLM limitations in time-series comprehension and extreme compression requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated EEG monitoring systems using LLMs face two critical limitations: 1) Clinical EEG recordings exceed LLM context windows, requiring extreme compression (400:1+ ratios) that destroys fine temporal precision, and 2) LLMs lack inherent time-series comprehension and rely on statistical associations from compressed representations, causing hallucination of clinically incorrect measurement values. A 0.5 Hz error can distinguish between different epilepsy syndromes, making precision crucial.

Method: A hybrid architecture that separates measurement extraction from text generation. The system: 1) Computes exact clinical values via signal processing before compression, 2) Employs a cross-modal bridge for EEG-to-language translation, 3) Uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning with constrained decoding around frozen slots, and 4) Implements multirate sampling to maintain long-range context while preserving event-level precision.

Result: Evaluation on TUH and CHB-MIT datasets shows 60% fewer false alarms, 50% faster detection, and sub-clinical measurement precision. This represents the first system guaranteeing clinical measurement accuracy in automated EEG reports.

Conclusion: By separating measurement extraction from text generation and using a hybrid architecture with signal processing before compression, the system overcomes fundamental limitations of LLMs for EEG analysis, achieving clinically reliable automated reporting with guaranteed measurement accuracy.

Abstract: Automated EEG monitoring requires clinician-level precision for seizure detection and reporting. Clinical EEG recordings exceed LLM context windows, requiring extreme compression (400:1+ ratios) that destroys fine-grained temporal precision. A 0.5 Hz error distinguishes absence epilepsy from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. LLMs lack inherent time-series comprehension and rely on statistical associations from compressed representations. This dual limitation causes systems to hallucinate clinically incorrect measurement values.
  We separate measurement extraction from text generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes online min-max optimization algorithms using cumulative saddle points, introduces new performance measures (SDual-Gap_T and DSP-Reg_T), and provides regret bounds under various function classes including strong convexity-strong concavity, min-max exponential concavity, and Polyak-Łojasiewicz conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static Nash equilibrium (SNE-Reg_T) is incompatible with individual regrets even for strongly convex-strongly concave functions, motivating the need for alternative performance measures in online min-max optimization beyond convex-concave settings.

Method: Proposes SDual-Gap_T (static duality gap) inspired by OCO framework and DSP-Reg_T (dynamic saddle point regret) as min-max version of dynamic regret. Uses reduction to classic OCO problems to develop algorithms achieving bounds for these measures under various function classes.

Result: Provides regret bounds for SDual-Gap_T and DSP-Reg_T under strong convexity-strong concavity and min-max exponential concavity. Establishes a class of functions satisfying min-max EC that captures two-player portfolio selection. Also derives bounds under two-sided Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition for dynamic regret compatible with individual regrets.

Conclusion: The paper introduces novel performance measures for online min-max optimization, develops algorithms with theoretical guarantees under various function classes, and connects min-max optimization to classic OCO through reduction techniques, expanding the theoretical framework beyond traditional convex-concave settings.

Abstract: We propose and study an online version of min-max optimization based on cumulative saddle points under a variety of performance measures beyond convex-concave settings. After first observing the incompatibility of (static) Nash equilibrium (SNE-Reg$_T$) with individual regrets even for strongly convex-strongly concave functions, we propose an alternate \emph{static} duality gap (SDual-Gap$_T$) inspired by the online convex optimization (OCO) framework. We provide algorithms that, using a reduction to classic OCO problems, achieve bounds for SDual-Gap$_T$~and a novel \emph{dynamic} saddle point regret (DSP-Reg$_T$), which we suggest naturally represents a min-max version of the dynamic regret in OCO. We derive our bounds for SDual-Gap$_T$~and DSP-Reg$_T$~under strong convexity-strong concavity and a min-max notion of exponential concavity (min-max EC), and in addition we establish a class of functions satisfying min-max EC~that captures a two-player variant of the classic portfolio selection problem. Finally, for a dynamic notion of regret compatible with individual regrets, we derive bounds under a two-sided Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VESPO is a new RL method for LLMs that addresses training stability issues by using variational optimization to derive a closed-form reshaping kernel for sequence-level importance weights, enabling stable training under high staleness and asynchronous execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training stability is a major challenge in RL for LLMs due to policy staleness, asynchronous training, and mismatches between training/inference engines, causing behavior policy divergence and risk of training collapse. Existing importance sampling methods suffer from high variance and lack unified theoretical foundation.

Method: VESPO (Variational sEquence-level Soft Policy Optimization) incorporates variance reduction into a variational formulation over proposal distributions, deriving a closed-form reshaping kernel that operates directly on sequence-level importance weights without length normalization.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show VESPO maintains stable training under staleness ratios up to 64x and fully asynchronous execution, and delivers consistent gains across both dense and Mixture-of-Experts models.

Conclusion: VESPO provides a theoretically grounded solution to RL training stability for LLMs, enabling robust training under challenging conditions like high staleness and asynchronous execution while improving performance across different model architectures.

Abstract: Training stability remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs). Policy staleness, asynchronous training, and mismatches between training and inference engines all cause the behavior policy to diverge from the current policy, risking training collapse. Importance sampling provides a principled correction for this distribution shift but suffers from high variance; existing remedies such as token-level clipping and sequence-level normalization lack a unified theoretical foundation. We propose Variational sEquence-level Soft Policy Optimization (VESPO). By incorporating variance reduction into a variational formulation over proposal distributions, VESPO derives a closed-form reshaping kernel that operates directly on sequence-level importance weights without length normalization. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that VESPO maintains stable training under staleness ratios up to 64x and fully asynchronous execution, and delivers consistent gains across both dense and Mixture-of-Experts models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: K-FADE: A novel LLM unlearning method using K-FAC Hessian approximations for efficient distribution erasure with minimal performance degradation on retained data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM training can produce undesirable outputs, and existing unlearning methods degrade model performance on distributions where the trainer wants to retain behavior. There's a need for better trade-off between forgetting unwanted data and preserving desired model behavior.

Method: K-FADE combines uphill Gauss-Newton steps with K-FAC (Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature) Hessian approximations to efficiently compute unlearning updates. It transforms output constraints on the retain set into weight constraints, allowing minimal behavioral changes on retained data.

Result: K-FADE suppresses outputs from forget sets while approximating retraining results without the forget set. It alters outputs on retain sets less than previous methods and allows cheap maintenance of unlearning through reapplicable updates.

Conclusion: K-FADE provides a state-of-the-art, conceptually simple unlearning approach for LLMs that efficiently erases unwanted distributions while preserving model behavior on desired data, with the added benefit of maintainable unlearning updates.

Abstract: Standard large language model training can create models that produce outputs their trainer deems unacceptable in deployment. The probability of these outputs can be reduced using methods such as LLM unlearning. However, unlearning a set of data (called the forget set) can degrade model performance on other distributions where the trainer wants to retain the model's behavior. To improve this trade-off, we demonstrate that using the forget set to compute only a few uphill Gauss-Newton steps provides a conceptually simple, state-of-the-art unlearning approach for LLMs. While Gauss-Newton steps adapt Newton's method to non-linear models, it is non-trivial to efficiently and accurately compute such steps for LLMs. Hence, our approach crucially relies on parametric Hessian approximations such as Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). We call this combined approach K-FADE (K-FAC for Distribution Erasure). Our evaluation on the WMDP and ToFU benchmarks demonstrates that K-FADE suppresses outputs from the forget set and approximates, in output space, the results of retraining without the forget set. Critically, our method does this while altering the outputs on the retain set less than previous methods. This is because K-FADE transforms a constraint on the model's outputs across the entire retain set into a constraint on the model's weights, allowing the algorithm to minimally change the model's behavior on the retain set at each step. Moreover, the unlearning updates computed by K-FADE can be reapplied later if the model undergoes further training, allowing unlearning to be cheaply maintained.

*Qiuran Zhao,Kai Ming Ting,Xinpeng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoGLAD is an interpretable unsupervised framework for graph-level anomaly detection that provides explanations by contrasting anomalies with nearest normal prototype graphs from the dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep GLAD methods are black-box and lack reliable explanations. Current explanation methods either don't reference normal graphs or use abstract latent vectors instead of concrete dataset graphs.

Method: ProtoGLAD uses a point-set kernel to iteratively discover multiple normal prototype graphs and their clusters from the dataset, then identifies graphs distant from all normal clusters as anomalies. Explanations are provided by contrasting each anomaly with its nearest normal prototype graph.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show ProtoGLAD achieves competitive anomaly detection performance compared to state-of-the-art GLAD methods while providing better human-interpretable prototype-based explanations.

Conclusion: ProtoGLAD addresses the interpretability limitations of existing GLAD methods by providing concrete, dataset-based prototype explanations while maintaining competitive detection performance.

Abstract: The task of graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD) is to identify anomalous graphs that deviate significantly from the majority of graphs in a dataset. While deep GLAD methods have shown promising performance, their black-box nature limits their reliability and deployment in real-world applications. Although some recent methods have made attempts to provide explanations for anomaly detection results, they either provide explanations without referencing normal graphs, or rely on abstract latent vectors as prototypes rather than concrete graphs from the dataset. To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (ProtoGLAD), an interpretable unsupervised framework that provides explanation for each detected anomaly by explicitly contrasting with its nearest normal prototype graph. It employs a point-set kernel to iteratively discover multiple normal prototype graphs and their associated clusters from the dataset, then identifying graphs distant from all discovered normal clusters as anomalies. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that ProtoGLAD achieves competitive anomaly detection performance compared to state-of-the-art GLAD methods while providing better human-interpretable prototype-based explanations.

TL;DR: Proposes a control-driven clipping strategy for DP-SGD that adapts clipping threshold using weight-only spectral diagnostics, avoiding per-example gradient statistics and reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptive clipping methods for DP-SGD rely on per-example gradient norm statistics, which adds computational overhead and is sensitive to datasets/architectures. Finding optimal clipping thresholds is challenging - too small causes optimization bias, too large degrades accuracy with noise.

Method: Uses lightweight spectral diagnostic from model parameters: periodically analyzes designated weight matrix via spectral decomposition, estimates heavy-tailed spectral indicator related to training stability. Indicator is smoothed and fed into bounded feedback controller that updates clipping threshold multiplicatively in log domain.

Result: Method produces threshold updates as post-processing (using only parameters from privacy-preserving training), so doesn't increase privacy loss beyond underlying DP optimizer under standard composition accounting.

Conclusion: Proposes a computationally efficient adaptive clipping method that avoids per-example gradient statistics, maintains privacy guarantees, and addresses the clipping threshold optimization problem in DP-SGD.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving training on sensitive data commonly relies on differentially private stochastic optimization with gradient clipping and Gaussian noise. The clipping threshold is a critical control knob: if set too small, systematic over-clipping induces optimization bias; if too large, injected noise dominates updates and degrades accuracy. Existing adaptive clipping methods often depend on per-example gradient norm statistics, adding computational overhead and introducing sensitivity to datasets and architectures. We propose a control-driven clipping strategy that adapts the threshold using a lightweight, weight-only spectral diagnostic computed from model parameters. At periodic probe steps, the method analyzes a designated weight matrix via spectral decomposition and estimates a heavy-tailed spectral indicator associated with training stability. This indicator is smoothed over time and fed into a bounded feedback controller that updates the clipping threshold multiplicatively in the log domain. Because the controller uses only parameters produced during privacy-preserving training, the resulting threshold updates are post-processing and do not increase privacy loss beyond that of the underlying DP optimizer under standard composition accounting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When replacing a source-trained model with one trained on shifted data, performance on the source domain can change unpredictably, making it difficult to understand why performance degrades and whether to deploy the new model.

Method: TRACE decomposes absolute risk change into four factors: two generalization gaps, a model change penalty, and a covariate shift penalty. The covariate shift penalty is estimated via model sensitivity (high-quantile input gradients) and data-shift measures (Optimal Transport or MMD). Model change penalty uses average output distance between models on target samples.

Result: TRACE bound correctly captures scaling of true risk difference with shift magnitude in linear regression. Across synthetic and vision benchmarks, TRACE diagnostics maintain strong monotonic relationship with true performance degradation. Deployment gate score correlates strongly with risk change and achieves high AUROC/AUPRC for gating decisions.

Conclusion: TRACE provides an interpretable, computable diagnostic framework for understanding risk changes under covariate shift, enabling safe and label-efficient model replacement decisions through actionable decomposition of performance degradation factors.

Abstract: When a source-trained model $Q$ is replaced by a model $\tilde{Q}$ trained on shifted data, its performance on the source domain can change unpredictably. To address this, we study the two-model risk change, $ΔR := R_P(\tilde{Q}) - R_P(Q)$, under covariate shift. We introduce TRACE (Theoretical Risk Attribution under Covariate-shift Effects), a framework that decomposes $|ΔR|$ into an interpretable upper bound. This decomposition disentangles the risk change into four actionable factors: two generalization gaps, a model change penalty, and a covariate shift penalty, transforming the bound into a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding why performance has changed. To make TRACE a fully computable diagnostic, we instantiate each term. The covariate shift penalty is estimated via a model sensitivity factor (from high-quantile input gradients) and a data-shift measure; we use feature-space Optimal Transport (OT) by default and provide a robust alternative using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The model change penalty is controlled by the average output distance between the two models on the target sample. Generalization gaps are estimated on held-out data. We validate our framework in an idealized linear regression setting, showing the TRACE bound correctly captures the scaling of the true risk difference with the magnitude of the shift. Across synthetic and vision benchmarks, TRACE diagnostics are valid and maintain a strong monotonic relationship with the true performance degradation. Crucially, we derive a deployment gate score that correlates strongly with $|ΔR|$ and achieves high AUROC/AUPRC for gating decisions, enabling safe, label-efficient model replacement.

TL;DR: Sparsification methods in GNNs improve efficiency for large-scale graph applications like power grid reliability analysis, with adaptive rewiring showing particular promise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high memory usage and computational costs in large-scale graph applications by applying sparsification as regularization in Graph Neural Networks.

Method: Use Network Science and Machine Learning techniques including Erdős-Rényi for model sparsification, explore GCN and GIN with different sparsification/rewiring levels, apply adaptive rewiring with early stopping.

Result: Sparsity improves generalization but excessive sparsity hinders complex pattern learning; adaptive rewiring with early stopping allows models to adapt connectivity structure during training.

Conclusion: Sparsification effectively improves GNN performance and scalability for critical applications like power grid reliability analysis, with adaptive rewiring showing particular promise.

Abstract: This paper explores sparsification methods as a form of regularization in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to address high memory usage and computational costs in large-scale graph applications. Using techniques from Network Science and Machine Learning, including Erdős-Rényi for model sparsification, we enhance the efficiency of GNNs for real-world applications. We demonstrate our approach on N-1 contingency assessment in electrical grids, a critical task for ensuring grid reliability. We apply our methods to three datasets of varying sizes, exploring Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) with different degrees of sparsification and rewiring. Comparison across sparsification levels shows the potential of combining insights from both research fields to improve GNN performance and scalability. Our experiments highlight the importance of tuning sparsity parameters: while sparsity can improve generalization, excessive sparsity may hinder learning of complex patterns. Our adaptive rewiring approach, particularly when combined with early stopping, proves promising by allowing the model to adapt its connectivity structure during training. This research contributes to understanding how sparsity can be effectively leveraged in GNNs for critical applications like power grid reliability analysis.

TL;DR: RI-FedAvg is a federated learning algorithm that uses a Roughness Index regularization to mitigate client drift in non-IID settings, achieving better accuracy and faster convergence than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces challenges in non-IID settings due to client drift, which impairs convergence. Existing methods struggle with heterogeneous data distributions across clients.

Method: RI-FedAvg incorporates a Roughness Index-based regularization term into the local objective function. The RI quantifies the roughness of high-dimensional loss landscapes, adaptively penalizing updates based on local loss fluctuations to mitigate client drift.

Theoretical analysis proves convergence to stationary points for non-convex objectives.

Conclusion: RI-FedAvg effectively enhances robustness and efficiency of federated learning in practical heterogeneous environments by addressing client drift through roughness-aware regularization.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy, yet faces challenges in non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings due to client drift, which impairs convergence. We propose RI-FedAvg, a novel FL algorithm that mitigates client drift by incorporating a Roughness Index (RI)-based regularization term into the local objective, adaptively penalizing updates based on the fluctuations of local loss landscapes. This paper introduces RI-FedAvg, leveraging the RI to quantify the roughness of high-dimensional loss functions, ensuring robust optimization in heterogeneous settings. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for non-convex objectives, establishing that RI-FedAvg converges to a stationary point under standard assumptions. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that RI-FedAvg outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including FedAvg, FedProx, FedDyn, SCAFFOLD, and DP-FedAvg, achieving higher accuracy and faster convergence in non-IID scenarios. Our results highlight RI-FedAvg's potential to enhance the robustness and efficiency of federated learning in practical, heterogeneous environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes nGEM, a natural gradient EM objective that accelerates training of mixture density networks by leveraging information geometry, achieving 10x faster convergence with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard maximum likelihood training of mixture density networks using negative log-likelihood suffers from slow convergence and mode collapse problems, which limits their practical effectiveness.

Method: The authors interpret mixture density networks as deep latent-variable models and analyze them through an expectation maximization framework, revealing connections to natural gradient descent. They then derive the natural gradient expectation maximization (nGEM) objective that integrates information geometry.

Result: Empirical results show nGEM achieves up to 10x faster convergence with almost zero computational overhead, and scales effectively to high-dimensional data where standard NLL training fails.

Conclusion: The proposed nGEM method successfully addresses optimization challenges in mixture density networks by leveraging their information geometry, providing a computationally efficient solution that enables better scaling to complex, high-dimensional problems.

Abstract: Mixture density networks are neural networks that produce Gaussian mixtures to represent continuous multimodal conditional densities. Standard training procedures involve maximum likelihood estimation using the negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective, which suffers from slow convergence and mode collapse. In this work, we improve the optimization of mixture density networks by integrating their information geometry. Specifically, we interpret mixture density networks as deep latent-variable models and analyze them through an expectation maximization framework, which reveals surprising theoretical connections to natural gradient descent. We then exploit such connections to derive the natural gradient expectation maximization (nGEM) objective. We show that empirically nGEM achieves up to 10$\times$ faster convergence while adding almost zerocomputational overhead, and scales well to high-dimensional data where NLL otherwise fails.

*Enrico Ahlers,Daniel Passon,Yannic Noller,Lars Grunske*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FIRE is an inference-time backdoor mitigation approach that neutralizes triggers by reversing their effects in the model's latent feature spaces, outperforming existing runtime defenses with low overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor mitigation strategies are ineffective or inefficient for already deployed vulnerable models, creating a need for runtime defenses that work during inference without model retraining.

Method: FIRE manipulates latent representations by identifying trigger-induced directions in feature spaces between layers and applying them in reverse to neutralize triggers at inference time.

Result: FIRE achieves low computational overhead and outperforms current runtime mitigations across various attacks, datasets, and network architectures in image benchmarks.

Conclusion: FIRE provides an effective inference-time defense against backdoor attacks by leveraging the structured nature of trigger effects in neural network feature spaces.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly present in our everyday lives; as a result, they become targets of adversarial attackers seeking to manipulate the systems we interact with. A well-known vulnerability is a backdoor introduced into a neural network by poisoned training data or a malicious training process. Backdoors can be used to induce unwanted behavior by including a certain trigger in the input. Existing mitigations filter training data, modify the model, or perform expensive input modifications on samples. If a vulnerable model has already been deployed, however, those strategies are either ineffective or inefficient. To address this gap, we propose our inference-time backdoor mitigation approach called FIRE (Feature-space Inference-time REpair). We hypothesize that a trigger induces structured and repeatable changes in the model's internal representation. We view the trigger as directions in the latent spaces between layers that can be applied in reverse to correct the inference mechanism. Therefore, we turn the backdoored model against itself by manipulating its latent representations and moving a poisoned sample's features along the backdoor directions to neutralize the trigger. Our evaluation shows that FIRE has low computational overhead and outperforms current runtime mitigations on image benchmarks across various attacks, datasets, and network architectures.

TL;DR: dnaHNet is a tokenizer-free genomic foundation model that uses adaptive chunking to compress nucleotides, achieving better scaling and biological interpretability than fixed-vocabulary or nucleotide-level models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current genomic models face a fundamental tradeoff: fixed-vocabulary tokenizers fragment biologically meaningful motifs, while nucleotide-level models preserve biological coherence but are computationally prohibitive for long contexts.

Method: dnaHNet uses a differentiable dynamic chunking mechanism to adaptively compress raw nucleotides into latent tokens, balancing compression with predictive accuracy. It's a tokenizer-free autoregressive model that segments and models genomic sequences end-to-end.

Conclusion: dnaHNet establishes a scalable, interpretable framework for next-generation genomic modeling that overcomes the tradeoff between biological coherence and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Genomic foundation models have the potential to decode DNA syntax, yet face a fundamental tradeoff in their input representation. Standard fixed-vocabulary tokenizers fragment biologically meaningful motifs such as codons and regulatory elements, while nucleotide-level models preserve biological coherence but incur prohibitive computational costs for long contexts. We introduce dnaHNet, a state-of-the-art tokenizer-free autoregressive model that segments and models genomic sequences end-to-end. Using a differentiable dynamic chunking mechanism, dnaHNet compresses raw nucleotides into latent tokens adaptively, balancing compression with predictive accuracy. Pretrained on prokaryotic genomes, dnaHNet outperforms leading architectures including StripedHyena2 in scaling and efficiency. This recursive chunking yields quadratic FLOP reductions, enabling $>3 \times$ inference speedup over Transformers.

These results establish dnaHNet as a scalable, interpretable framework for next-generation genomic modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CycFlow replaces diffusion-based heatmap generation with deterministic point transport for TSP, using flow matching to transform coordinates to a circular arrangement for linear-time solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Neural Combinatorial Optimization methods are dominated by diffusion models that treat TSP as quadratic heatmap generation, which is computationally expensive. There's a need for faster solving methods that maintain solution quality.

Method: CycFlow learns an instance-conditioned vector field that continuously transports 2D input coordinates to a canonical circular arrangement. The optimal tour is recovered from this 2N-dimensional representation via angular sorting, using flow matching instead of iterative edge denoising.

Result: CycFlow accelerates solving speed by up to three orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art diffusion baselines while maintaining competitive optimality gaps.

Conclusion: The framework successfully shifts from quadratic edge scoring to linear coordinate dynamics, demonstrating that deterministic point transport can outperform stochastic heatmap generation for TSP solving.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) have been dominated by diffusion models that treat the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a stochastic $N \times N$ heatmap generation task. In this paper, we propose CycFlow, a framework that replaces iterative edge denoising with deterministic point transport. CycFlow learns an instance-conditioned vector field that continuously transports input 2D coordinates to a canonical circular arrangement, where the optimal tour is recovered from this $2N$ dimensional representation via angular sorting. By leveraging data-dependent flow matching, we bypass the quadratic bottleneck of edge scoring in favor of linear coordinate dynamics. This paradigm shift accelerates solving speed by up to three orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art diffusion baselines, while maintaining competitive optimality gaps.

*Nicolás Becerra-Zuniga,Lucas Lacasa,Eusebio Valero,Gonzalo Rubio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINNs face accuracy limits from data-PDE inconsistencies; a "consistency barrier" emerges as an intrinsic error bound when training data doesn't fully match governing equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs are widely used for PDE modeling but often trained with imperfect data (noisy measurements, discretization errors, modeling assumptions). The impact of such data-to-PDE inconsistencies on PINN accuracy and convergence remains poorly understood.

Method: Systematic analysis using 1D viscous Burgers equation with manufactured analytical solution to isolate effects. PINNs trained with datasets of varying numerical accuracy and perfectly consistent analytical data to quantify the "consistency barrier" - an intrinsic error lower bound from data-PDE mismatches.

Result: PDE residual helps PINNs partially mitigate low-fidelity data and recover physical structure, but training saturates at error levels dictated by data inconsistency. With high-fidelity numerical data, PINN solutions match those from analytical data, effectively removing the consistency barrier.

Conclusion: Data quality fundamentally limits PINN accuracy through consistency barriers. The interplay between data fidelity and physics enforcement clarifies practical guidance for constructing and interpreting physics-informed surrogate models.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention as a surrogate modeling strategy for partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in regimes where labeled data are scarce and physical constraints can be leveraged to regularize the learning process. In practice, however, PINNs are frequently trained using experimental or numerical data that are not fully consistent with the governing equations due to measurement noise, discretization errors, or modeling assumptions. The implications of such data-to-PDE inconsistencies on the accuracy and convergence of PINNs remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we systematically analyze how data inconsistency fundamentally limits the attainable accuracy of PINNs. We introduce the concept of a consistency barrier, defined as an intrinsic lower bound on the error that arises from mismatches between the fidelity of the data and the exact enforcement of the PDE residual. To isolate and quantify this effect, we consider the 1D viscous Burgers equation with a manufactured analytical solution, which enables full control over data fidelity and residual errors. PINNs are trained using datasets of progressively increasing numerical accuracy, as well as perfectly consistent analytical data. Results show that while the inclusion of the PDE residual allows PINNs to partially mitigate low-fidelity data and recover the dominant physical structure, the training process ultimately saturates at an error level dictated by the data inconsistency. When high-fidelity numerical data are employed, PINN solutions become indistinguishable from those trained on analytical data, indicating that the consistency barrier is effectively removed. These findings clarify the interplay between data quality and physics enforcement in PINNs providing practical guidance for the construction and interpretation of physics-informed surrogate models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pupillometry alone can compete with EEG for cognitive load classification using interpretable feature-based models, enabling practical wearable monitoring systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cognitive load assessment methods using EEG are resource-intensive and limited in wearability, while deep learning approaches lack interpretability. There's a need for lightweight, practical monitoring solutions for real-world applications in education, healthcare, and neuropsychiatry.

Method: Used OpenNeuro 'Digit Span Task' dataset to compare EEG and pupillometry for cognitive load classification. Employed feature-based approaches using Catch-22 features with classical machine learning models, and compared against deep learning methods. Used SHAP for feature analysis to provide physiologically meaningful insights.

Result: Feature-based approaches with Catch-22 features and classical ML outperformed deep learning in both binary and multiclass tasks. Pupillometry alone could compete with EEG performance, challenging the assumption that EEG is necessary for load detection.

Conclusion: Pupillometry serves as a portable, practical proxy for cognitive load monitoring, enabling development of wearable, affordable systems for real-world applications without the technological demands of EEG.

Abstract: Cognitive load, the mental effort required during working memory, is central to neuroscience, psychology, and human-computer interaction. Accurate assessment is vital for adaptive learning, clinical monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. Physiological signals such as pupillometry and electroencephalography are established biomarkers of cognitive load, but their comparative utility and practical integration as lightweight, wearable monitoring solutions remain underexplored. EEG provides high temporal resolution of neural activity. Although non-invasive, it is technologically demanding and limited in wearability and cost due to its resource-intensive nature, whereas pupillometry is non-invasive, portable, and scalable. Existing studies often rely on deep learning models with limited interpretability and substantial computational expense. This study integrates feature-based and model-driven approaches to advance time-series analysis. Using the OpenNeuro 'Digit Span Task' dataset, this study investigates cognitive load classification from EEG and pupillometry. Feature-based approaches using Catch-22 features and classical machine learning models outperform deep learning in both binary and multiclass tasks. The findings demonstrate that pupillometry alone can compete with EEG, serving as a portable and practical proxy for real-world applications. These results challenge the assumption that EEG is necessary for load detection, showing that pupil dynamics combined with interpretable models and SHAP based feature analysis provide physiologically meaningful insights. This work supports the development of wearable, affordable cognitive monitoring systems for neuropsychiatry, education, and healthcare.

*Fanpu Cao,Lu Dai,Jindong Han,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GTR is a plug-and-play module that enhances multivariate time series forecasting by retrieving global periodic patterns beyond limited historical context, improving performance with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTSF models are limited by short historical context, preventing them from capturing global periodic patterns that span cycles longer than input horizons. Naive solutions like extending historical windows cause overfitting, high computational costs, and redundant information processing.

Method: GTR maintains adaptive global temporal embeddings of entire cycles and dynamically retrieves relevant global segments aligned with input sequences. It uses 2D convolution and residual fusion to jointly model local and global dependencies without altering host model architecture.

Result: Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets show GTR consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios with minimal parameter and computational overhead.

Conclusion: GTR provides an efficient, lightweight, plug-and-play solution for enhancing global periodicity modeling in MTSF tasks, effectively bridging short-term observations with long-term periodic patterns.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in numerous real-world applications, yet existing models remain constrained by their reliance on a limited historical context. This limitation prevents them from effectively capturing global periodic patterns that often span cycles significantly longer than the input horizon - despite such patterns carrying strong predictive signals. Naive solutions, such as extending the historical window, lead to severe drawbacks, including overfitting, prohibitive computational costs, and redundant information processing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Global Temporal Retriever (GTR), a lightweight and plug-and-play module designed to extend any forecasting model's temporal awareness beyond the immediate historical context. GTR maintains an adaptive global temporal embedding of the entire cycle and dynamically retrieves and aligns relevant global segments with the input sequence. By jointly modeling local and global dependencies through a 2D convolution and residual fusion, GTR effectively bridges short-term observations with long-term periodicity without altering the host model architecture. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios, while incurring minimal parameter and computational overhead. These results highlight GTR as an efficient and general solution for enhancing global periodicity modeling in MTSF tasks. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/macovaseas/GTR.

TL;DR: TSFMs show strong zero-shot performance for electricity demand forecasting, outperforming traditional methods with 47% error reduction, stable accuracy with minimal context, and varying calibration quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether Time Series Foundation Models' zero-shot capabilities translate to mission-critical electricity demand forecasting applications where accuracy, calibration, and robustness directly affect grid operations.

Method: Multi-dimensional benchmark evaluating four TSFMs (Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-2, Moirai-2, TinyTimeMixer) alongside Prophet, SARIMA, and Seasonal Naive using ERCOT hourly load data (2020-2024) on consumer-grade hardware. Evaluation spans four axes: context length sensitivity, probabilistic forecast calibration, robustness under distribution shifts, and prescriptive analytics.

Result: Top-performing foundation models achieve MASE values near 0.31 at long context lengths (2048h), a 47% reduction over Seasonal Naive baseline. TSFMs maintain stable accuracy even with minimal context (24h) while Prophet fails when fitting window is shorter than seasonality period. Calibration varies: Chronos-2 produces well-calibrated intervals while Moirai-2 and Prophet exhibit overconfidence.

Conclusion: TSFMs demonstrate practical value for electricity demand forecasting with structural advantages over traditional methods, particularly in handling minimal context and maintaining accuracy. The study provides model selection guidelines and releases benchmark framework for reproducibility.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have introduced zero-shot prediction capabilities that bypass the need for task-specific training. Whether these capabilities translate to mission-critical applications such as electricity demand forecasting--where accuracy, calibration, and robustness directly affect grid operations--remains an open question. We present a multi-dimensional benchmark evaluating four TSFMs (Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-2, Moirai-2, and TinyTimeMixer) alongside Prophet as an industry-standard baseline and two statistical references (SARIMA and Seasonal Naive), using ERCOT hourly load data from 2020 to 2024. All experiments run on consumer-grade hardware (AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, no GPU). The evaluation spans four axes: (1) context length sensitivity from 24 to 2048 hours, (2) probabilistic forecast calibration, (3) robustness under distribution shifts including COVID-19 lockdowns and Winter Storm Uri, and (4) prescriptive analytics for operational decision support. The top-performing foundation models achieve MASE values near 0.31 at long context lengths (C = 2048h, day-ahead horizon), a 47% reduction over the Seasonal Naive baseline. The inclusion of Prophet exposes a structural advantage of pre-trained models: Prophet fails when the fitting window is shorter than its seasonality period (MASE > 74 at 24-hour context), while TSFMs maintain stable accuracy even with minimal context because they recognise temporal patterns learned during pre-training rather than estimating them from scratch. Calibration varies substantially across models--Chronos-2 produces well-calibrated prediction intervals (95% empirical coverage at 90% nominal level) while both Moirai-2 and Prophet exhibit overconfidence (~70% coverage). We provide practical model selection guidelines and release the complete benchmark framework for reproducibility.

*Rustam Zhumagambetov,Niklas Giesa,Sebastian D. Boie,Stefan Haufe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Privacy attacks are ineffective against synthetic clinical time series data when generators are trained on large datasets, and differential privacy mechanisms don't improve privacy but reduce utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical data sharing for ML is restricted by privacy concerns. Synthetic data from genAI models offers a solution, but current privacy mechanisms (k-anonymization, differential privacy) have limitations - either ineffective or reduce data utility. Privacy audits are essential for generative time series models.

Method: Used established privacy attacks to audit state-of-the-art hospital time series models trained on MIMIC-IV dataset. Also used eICU dataset to mount privacy attacks against synthetic data generators trained on MIMIC-IV. Evaluated effectiveness of existing differential privacy mechanisms.

Result: Privacy attacks are ineffective against generated multivariate clinical time series when synthetic data generators are trained on large enough training datasets. Existing DP mechanisms would not improve privacy but only decrease utility for ML prediction tasks.

Conclusion: For large training datasets, current privacy attacks are ineffective against synthetic clinical time series, and implementing differential privacy would reduce utility without meaningful privacy gains. Synthetic data from properly trained generators on large datasets can be privacy-preserving.

Abstract: Sharing medical data for machine learning model training purposes is often impossible due to the risk of disclosing identifying information about individual patients. Synthetic data produced by generative artificial intelligence (genAI) models trained on real data is often seen as one possible solution to comply with privacy regulations. While powerful genAI models for heterogeneous hospital time series have recently been introduced, such modeling does not guarantee privacy protection, as the generated data may still reveal identifying information about individuals in the models' training cohort. Applying established privacy mechanisms to generative time series models, however, proves challenging as post-hoc data anonymization through k-anonymization or similar techniques is limited, while model-centered privacy mechanisms that implement differential privacy (DP) may lead to unstable training, compromising the utility of generated data. Given these known limitations, privacy audits for generative time series models are currently indispensable regardless of the concrete privacy mechanisms applied to models and/or data. In this work, we use a battery of established privacy attacks to audit state-of-the-art hospital time series models, trained on the public MIMIC-IV dataset, with respect to privacy preservation. Furthermore, the eICU dataset was used to mount a privacy attack against the synthetic data generator trained on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Results show that established privacy attacks are ineffective against generated multivariate clinical time series when synthetic data generators are trained on large enough training datasets. Furthermore, we discuss how the use of existing DP mechanisms for these synthetic data generators would not bring desired improvement in privacy, but only a decrease in utility for machine learning prediction tasks.

Integrated with GRPO-based training pipeline.

Result: Consistently outperforms text-based baselines on diverse information-seeking benchmarks. Visual snapshot grounding with information-level credit assignment alleviates credit-assignment bottleneck in open-ended web environments.

Conclusion: Visual-native approach with ICA effectively addresses the credit assignment problem in web information-seeking tasks by leveraging visual layout cues and providing dense learning signals through posterior analysis of retrieved content contributions.

Abstract: Despite the strong performance achieved by reinforcement learning-trained information-seeking agents, learning in open-ended web environments remains severely constrained by low signal-to-noise feedback. Text-based parsers often discard layout semantics and introduce unstructured noise, while long-horizon training typically relies on sparse outcome rewards that obscure which retrieval actions actually matter. We propose a visual-native search framework that represents webpages as visual snapshots, allowing agents to leverage layout cues to quickly localize salient evidence and suppress distractors. To learn effectively from these high-dimensional observations, we introduce Information-Aware Credit Assignment (ICA), a post-hoc method that estimates each retrieved snapshot's contribution to the final outcome via posterior analysis and propagates dense learning signals back to key search turns. Integrated with a GRPO-based training pipeline, our approach consistently outperforms text-based baselines on diverse information-seeking benchmarks, providing evidence that visual snapshot grounding with information-level credit assignment alleviates the credit-assignment bottleneck in open-ended web environments.

TL;DR: CG-BGs combine coarse-grained modeling with Boltzmann Generators to enable scalable, unbiased sampling of molecular systems using learned potentials of mean force and importance sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Boltzmann Generators have limited scalability for large molecular systems, while coarse-grained models often lack proper reweighting to ensure correct statistical sampling from the Boltzmann distribution.

Method: Propose Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators (CG-BGs) that operate in coarse-grained coordinate space, using a learned potential of mean force (PMF) to reweight samples from a flow-based model. The PMF is efficiently learned via force matching from rapidly converged data.

Result: CG-BGs successfully capture complex interactions mediated by explicit solvent within highly reduced representations, demonstrating faithful sampling of molecular configurations.

Conclusion: CG-BGs provide a scalable, principled framework for unbiased sampling of larger molecular systems by unifying reduced-order modeling with exact importance sampling techniques.

Abstract: Sampling equilibrium molecular configurations from the Boltzmann distribution is a longstanding challenge. Boltzmann Generators (BGs) address this by combining exact-likelihood generative models with importance sampling, but their practical scalability is limited. Meanwhile, coarse-grained surrogates enable the modeling of larger systems by reducing effective dimensionality, yet often lack the reweighting process required to ensure asymptotically correct statistics. In this work, we propose Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators (CG-BGs), a principled framework that unifies scalable reduced-order modeling with the exactness of importance sampling. CG-BGs act in a coarse-grained coordinate space, using a learned potential of mean force (PMF) to reweight samples generated by a flow-based model. Crucially, we show that this PMF can be efficiently learned from rapidly converged data via force matching. Our results demonstrate that CG-BGs faithfully capture complex interactions mediated by explicit solvent within highly reduced representations, establishing a scalable pathway for the unbiased sampling of larger molecular systems.

*Xuefeng Xu,Graham Cormode*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedPS is a unified framework for federated data preprocessing using aggregated statistics and data-sketching techniques to enable efficient, privacy-preserving preprocessing in FL systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data preprocessing is critical for model performance but largely overlooked in FL research. Practical FL systems face challenges: privacy constraints prevent centralizing raw data, and communication efficiency requirements complicate distributed preprocessing.

Method: FedPS uses data-sketching techniques to efficiently summarize local datasets while preserving essential statistical information. It designs federated algorithms for feature scaling, encoding, discretization, and missing-value imputation, and extends preprocessing-related models (k-Means, k-NN, Bayesian Linear Regression) to both horizontal and vertical FL settings.

Result: FedPS provides flexible, communication-efficient, and consistent preprocessing pipelines for practical FL deployments, enabling collaborative preprocessing without sharing raw data.

Conclusion: FedPS addresses the critical but overlooked preprocessing stage in FL, offering a unified framework that balances privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and preprocessing effectiveness for real-world FL systems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple parties to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data. However, before training, data must be preprocessed to address missing values, inconsistent formats, and heterogeneous feature scales. This preprocessing stage is critical for model performance but is largely overlooked in FL research. In practical FL systems, privacy constraints prohibit centralizing raw data, while communication efficiency introduces further challenges for distributed preprocessing. We introduce FedPS, a unified framework for federated data preprocessing based on aggregated statistics. FedPS leverages data-sketching techniques to efficiently summarize local datasets while preserving essential statistical information. Building on these summaries, we design federated algorithms for feature scaling, encoding, discretization, and missing-value imputation, and extend preprocessing-related models such as k-Means, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Bayesian Linear Regression to both horizontal and vertical FL settings. FedPS provides flexible, communication-efficient, and consistent preprocessing pipelines for practical FL deployments.

### [176] [Evaluation metrics for temporal preservation in synthetic longitudinal patient data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10643)
*Katariina Perkonoja,Parisa Movahedi,Antti Airola,Kari Auranen,Joni Virta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes metrics for evaluating temporal preservation in synthetic longitudinal patient data, showing that marginal resemblance can hide distortions in covariance and individual trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic data evaluation often focuses on marginal statistics but may miss important temporal characteristics. There's a need for comprehensive metrics to assess how well synthetic data preserves temporal structures in longitudinal patient data.

Method: Developed a set of metrics categorized into four temporal characteristics: marginal, covariance, individual-level, and measurement structures. Analyzed how factors like data quality, measurement frequency, and preprocessing strategies affect temporal preservation.

Result: Strong marginal-level resemblance can conceal distortions in covariance and individual trajectories. Temporal preservation is influenced by original data quality, measurement frequency, and preprocessing. No single metric adequately captures temporal preservation - multidimensional evaluation is needed.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics enable more reliable evaluation and improvement of generative models for creating temporally realistic synthetic longitudinal patient data, providing a comprehensive assessment across multiple temporal characteristics.

Abstract: This study introduces a set of metrics for evaluating temporal preservation in synthetic longitudinal patient data, defined as artificially generated data that mimic real patients' repeated measurements over time. The proposed metrics assess how synthetic data reproduces key temporal characteristics, categorized into marginal, covariance, individual-level and measurement structures. We show that strong marginal-level resemblance may conceal distortions in covariance and disruptions in individual-level trajectories. Temporal preservation is influenced by factors such as original data quality, measurement frequency, and preprocessing strategies, including binning, variable encoding and precision. Variables with sparse or highly irregular measurement times provide limited information for learning temporal dependencies, resulting in reduced resemblance between the synthetic and original data. No single metric adequately captures temporal preservation; instead, a multidimensional evaluation across all characteristics provides a more comprehensive assessment of synthetic data quality. Overall, the proposed metrics clarify how and why temporal structures are preserved or degraded, enabling more reliable evaluation and improvement of generative models and supporting the creation of temporally realistic synthetic longitudinal patient data.

*Aashwin Mishra,Matt Seaberg,Ryan Roussel,Daniel Ratner,Apurva Mehta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Domain knowledge guided Bayesian Optimization uses physical insight to transform coordinates, decoupling high-dimensional parameters and aligning with active subspaces, enabling efficient optimization in challenging needle-in-a-haystack scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Bayesian Optimization struggles with high-dimensional problems where parameters are tightly coupled and objective landscapes are highly asymmetric with sparse rewards. This is particularly problematic for complex scientific instruments like optical systems at X-ray Free Electron Lasers.

Method: Proposes a domain knowledge guided Bayesian Optimization approach that leverages physical insight to transform coordinates, decoupling input features and aligning active subspaces with primary search axes. Combined with reverse annealing exploration strategy.

Result: Successfully optimized a challenging 12-dimensional, 6-crystal Split-and-Delay optical system where conventional methods (standard BO, TuRBO, multi-objective BO) failed. The approach reliably converges to the global optimum by accelerating search through coordinate transformation.

Conclusion: Physical insight can transform high-dimensional, coupled optimization problems into simpler representations, enabling rapid and robust automated tuning while retaining existing optimization algorithms. This provides a generalizable paradigm for complex scientific instrument optimization.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing complex non-linear systems. However, its performance degrades in high-dimensional problems with tightly coupled parameters and highly asymmetric objective landscapes, where rewards are sparse. In such needle-in-a-haystack scenarios, even advanced methods like trust-region BO (TurBO) often lead to unsatisfactory results. We propose a domain knowledge guided Bayesian Optimization approach, which leverages physical insight to fundamentally simplify the search problem by transforming coordinates to decouple input features and align the active subspaces with the primary search axes. We demonstrate this approach's efficacy on a challenging 12-dimensional, 6-crystal Split-and-Delay optical system, where conventional approaches, including standard BO, TuRBO and multi-objective BO, consistently led to unsatisfactory results. When combined with an reverse annealing exploration strategy, this approach reliably converges to the global optimum. The coordinate transformation itself is the key to this success, significantly accelerating the search by aligning input co-ordinate axes with the problem's active subspaces. As increasingly complex scientific instruments, from large telescopes to new spectrometers at X-ray Free Electron Lasers are deployed, the demand for robust high-dimensional optimization grows. Our results demonstrate a generalizable paradigm: leveraging physical insight to transform high-dimensional, coupled optimization problems into simpler representations can enable rapid and robust automated tuning for consistent high performance while still retaining current optimization algorithms.

### [179] [Rotary Positional Embeddings as Phase Modulation: Theoretical Bounds on the RoPE Base for Long-Context Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10959)
*Feilong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RoPE positional embeddings have precision-dependent lower and upper bounds for long contexts - a "Goldilocks zone" between aliasing and numerical precision limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) are widely used but their behavior at long context lengths is poorly understood, especially regarding how base parameters affect positional coherence and numerical stability.

Method: Reinterpret RoPE as phase modulation applied to complex oscillators, enabling analysis through classical signal processing theory. Derive lower bounds (aliasing and DC stability) and upper bounds (floating-point precision) on RoPE base parameters.

Result: Identified precision- and depth-dependent feasibility region for RoPE base parameters. Validated framework on LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek variants, showing observed successes/failures align with predicted bounds. Models violating stability bounds exhibit attention collapse.

Conclusion: RoPE has fundamental limits: lower bounds prevent aliasing and phase drift, upper bounds prevent numerical precision loss. This creates a "Goldilocks zone" for long-context transformers, explaining why scaling beyond ~1M tokens faces a hard precision wall.

Abstract: Rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) are widely used in large language models to encode token positions through multiplicative rotations, yet their behavior at long context lengths remains poorly characterized. In this work, we reinterpret RoPE as phase modulation applied to a bank of complex oscillators, enabling analysis through classical signal processing theory.
  Under this formulation, we derive principled lower bounds on the RoPE base parameter that are necessary to preserve positional coherence over a target context length. These include a fundamental aliasing bound, analogous to a Nyquist limit, and a DC-component stability bound that constrains phase drift in low-frequency positional modes. We further extend this analysis to deep transformers, showing that repeated rotary modulation across layers compounds angular misalignment, tightening the base requirement as depth increases.
  Complementing these results, we derive a precision-dependent upper bound on the RoPE base arising from finite floating-point resolution. Beyond this limit, incremental phase updates become numerically indistinguishable, leading to positional erasure even in the absence of aliasing. Together, the lower and upper bounds define a precision- and depth-dependent feasibility region a Goldilocks zone for long-context transformers.
  We validate the framework through a comprehensive case study of state-of-the-art models, including LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek variants, showing that observed successes, failures, and community retrofits align closely with the predicted bounds. Notably, models that violate the stability bound exhibit attention collapse and long-range degradation, while attempts to scale beyond one million tokens encounter a hard precision wall independent of architecture or training.

*Paweł Lorek,Rafał Topolnicki,Tomasz Trzciński,Maciej Zięba,Aleksandra Krystecka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flow-based model with stratified sampling reduces estimation uncertainty for expectation of functions of random variables, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for estimating expectations of functions of random variables rely on (semi-)parametric distribution assumptions (Gaussian/mixed Gaussian), which can lead to significant estimation uncertainty when assumptions don't hold.

Method: Proposes a flow-based model integrated with stratified sampling that uses parametrized neural networks for flexible modeling of unknown data distributions.

Result: Model shows marked reduction in estimation uncertainty across multiple datasets, including high-dimensional ones (30 and 128 dimensions), outperforming crude Monte Carlo estimators and Gaussian mixture models.

Conclusion: The flow-based approach with stratified sampling provides more flexible distribution modeling and reduces estimation uncertainty compared to traditional parametric methods.

Abstract: Estimating the expectation of a real-valued function of a random variable from sample data is a critical aspect of statistical analysis, with far-reaching implications in various applications. Current methodologies typically assume (semi-)parametric distributions such as Gaussian or mixed Gaussian, leading to significant estimation uncertainty if these assumptions do not hold. We propose a flow-based model, integrated with stratified sampling, that leverages a parametrized neural network to offer greater flexibility in modeling unknown data distributions, thereby mitigating this limitation. Our model shows a marked reduction in estimation uncertainty across multiple datasets, including high-dimensional (30 and 128) ones, outperforming crude Monte Carlo estimators and Gaussian mixture models.

TL;DR: This paper argues that Riemannian geometry should be the foundational framework for graph representation learning, proposing it as a unifying paradigm rather than isolated techniques, and outlines a research agenda to address current limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphs have non-Euclidean structures with complex interactions, but current Riemannian approaches are limited to narrow manifolds (mainly hyperbolic spaces) and use extrinsic formulations. The paper contends that the central mission is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored.

Method: The paper identifies conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outlines a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type (beyond hyperbolic spaces), neural architecture (intrinsic formulations), and learning paradigm. It discusses theoretical foundations and promising directions.

Result: The paper provides a coherent viewpoint that Riemannian geometry offers a principled foundation for graph learning, positioning it as a unifying paradigm. It identifies key gaps and proposes a research framework to advance the field beyond current limitations.

Conclusion: Riemannian geometry should be viewed as a foundational framework for graph representation learning. The paper aims to stimulate broader exploration of this approach and unlock its full potential through addressing identified gaps in manifold types, neural architectures, and learning paradigms.

Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous, and learning on graphs has become a cornerstone in artificial intelligence and data mining communities. Unlike pixel grids in images or sequential structures in language, graphs exhibit a typical non-Euclidean structure with complex interactions among the objects. This paper argues that Riemannian geometry provides a principled and necessary foundation for graph representation learning, and that Riemannian graph learning should be viewed as a unifying paradigm rather than a collection of isolated techniques. While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations. We contend that the central mission of Riemannian graph learning is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored. To advance this perspective, we identify key conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outline a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type, neural architecture, and learning paradigm. We further discuss open challenges, theoretical foundations, and promising directions that are critical for unlocking the full potential of Riemannian graph learning. This paper aims to provide a coherent viewpoint and to stimulate broader exploration of Riemannian geometry as a foundational framework for future graph learning research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SnapMLA is an FP8 MLA decoding framework that optimizes long-context efficiency through hardware-aware algorithm-kernel co-optimization, achieving up to 1.91x throughput improvement with minimal performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FP8 attention shows promise but faces challenges when integrated into DeepSeek MLA decoding: numerical heterogeneity from decoupled positional embeddings, misaligned quantization scales in FP8 PV GEMM, and lack of optimized system-level support.

Method: Three key techniques: 1) RoPE-Aware Per-Token KV Quantization (maintaining RoPE in high precision with per-token granularity), 2) Quantized PV Computation Pipeline Reconstruction (fixing quantization scale misalignment), 3) End-to-End Dataflow Optimization (efficient data workflow with specialized kernels).

Result: Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLA LLMs show SnapMLA achieves up to 1.91x throughput improvement with negligible performance degradation in challenging long-context tasks including mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: SnapMLA successfully addresses FP8 integration challenges in MLA decoding through hardware-aware co-optimization, delivering substantial throughput gains while maintaining accuracy for long-context tasks.

Abstract: While FP8 attention has shown substantial promise in innovations like FlashAttention-3, its integration into the decoding phase of the DeepSeek Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) architecture presents notable challenges. These challenges include numerical heterogeneity arising from the decoupling of positional embeddings, misalignment of quantization scales in FP8 PV GEMM, and the need for optimized system-level support. In this paper, we introduce SnapMLA, an FP8 MLA decoding framework optimized to improve long-context efficiency through the following hardware-aware algorithm-kernel co-optimization techniques: (i) RoPE-Aware Per-Token KV Quantization, where the RoPE part is maintained in high precision, motivated by our comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneous quantization sensitivity inherent to the MLA KV cache. Furthermore, per-token granularity is employed to align with the autoregressive decoding process and maintain quantization accuracy. (ii) Quantized PV Computation Pipeline Reconstruction, which resolves the misalignment of quantization scale in FP8 PV computation stemming from the shared KV structure of the MLA KV cache. (iii) End-to-End Dataflow Optimization, where we establish an efficient data read-and-write workflow using specialized kernels, ensuring efficient data flow and performance gains. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLA LLMs show that SnapMLA achieves up to a 1.91x improvement in throughput, with negligible risk of performance degradation in challenging long-context tasks, including mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks.

*Ammar Ali,Baher Mohammad,Denis Makhov,Dmitriy Shopkhoev,Magauiya Zhussip,Stamatios Lefkimmiatis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ROCKET is a training-free model compression method that uses multi-choice knapsack optimization for layer-wise compression allocation and single-step sparse matrix factorization, achieving state-of-the-art compression (20-50%) with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model compression methods often require extensive training, fine-tuning, or iterative optimization, which is computationally expensive. There's a need for efficient training-free compression that can achieve high compression rates while preserving model performance.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) Formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem to optimally select compression levels per layer while meeting target model size. 2) Introduces single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning - sparsifies weights based on activation-weight sensitivity and updates dictionary via closed-form least squares, bypassing iterative optimization.

Result: Outperforms existing compression methods across different architectures at 20-50% compression rates. Retains over 90% of original performance at 30% compression without fine-tuning. With light fine-tuning (30M tokens), compressing Qwen3-14B to 8B yields performance nearly matching original Qwen3-8B.

Conclusion: ROCKET provides an effective training-free compression approach that achieves state-of-the-art results through optimal layer-wise compression allocation and efficient sparse factorization, enabling significant model size reduction with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: We present ROCKET, a training-free model compression method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with factorization, structured-sparsification and dynamic compression baselines. Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\% of the original model's performance at 30\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B. The code for ROCKET is at github.com/mts-ai/ROCKET/tree/main.

*Seockbean Song,Chenyu Gan,Youngsik Yoon,Siwei Wang,Wei Chen,Jungseul Ok*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CURE-UCB algorithm for Rising Multi-Armed Bandits that explicitly incorporates horizon information to outperform horizon-agnostic strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RMAB models practical scenarios where rewards increase with repeated plays (e.g., robotics, hyperparameter tuning). Horizon-dependent optimality means optimal strategies shift dramatically with budget T, making horizon knowledge highly valuable but underexplored.

Method: Proposed CUmulative Reward Estimation UCB (CURE-UCB) that explicitly integrates the horizon T into the decision-making algorithm.

Result: Rigorous analysis establishes new regret upper bound, proves strict superiority over horizon-agnostic strategies in structured environments like "linear-then-flat" instances, with extensive experiments showing significant superiority over baselines.

Conclusion: Horizon-aware approaches are crucial for RMAB problems, and CURE-UCB effectively leverages horizon information to achieve better performance than existing methods.

Abstract: The Rising Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) framework models environments where expected rewards of arms increase with plays, which models practical scenarios where performance of each option improves with the repeated usage, such as in robotics and hyperparameter tuning. For instance, in hyperparameter tuning, the validation accuracy of a model configuration (arm) typically increases with each training epoch. A defining characteristic of RMAB is em horizon-dependent optimality: unlike standard settings, the optimal strategy here shifts dramatically depending on the available budget $T$. This implies that knowledge of $T$ yields significantly greater utility in RMAB, empowering the learner to align its decision-making with this shifting optimality. However, the horizon-aware setting remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel CUmulative Reward Estimation UCB (CURE-UCB) that explicitly integrates the horizon. We provide a rigorous analysis establishing a new regret upper bound and prove that our method strictly outperforms horizon-agnostic strategies in structured environments like ``linear-then-flat'' instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant superiority over baselines.

*Returaj Burnwal,Nirav Pravinbhai Bhatt,Balaraman Ravindran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OSIL is an offline safe imitation learning algorithm that learns safe and reward-maximizing policies from demonstrations without explicit safety cost or reward labels, using non-preferred trajectories to infer safety constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online learning in real-world domains can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs is difficult. However, collecting trajectories showing undesirable/unsafe behavior (non-preferred trajectories) is often feasible, providing implicit safety information.

Method: Formulates safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates likelihood of non-preferred behavior from demonstrations.

Result: Empirically demonstrates that OSIL can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading reward performance, outperforming several baselines.

Conclusion: OSIL enables agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations without explicit safety cost or reward annotations, using non-preferred trajectories to infer safety constraints.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of offline safe imitation learning (IL), where the goal is to learn safe and reward-maximizing policies from demonstrations that do not have per-timestep safety cost or reward information. In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines.

*Maximilian Plattner,Fabian Paischer,Johannes Brandstetter,Arturs Berzins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 3D diffusion transformers for surface completion suffer from "Meltdown" - small input perturbations cause catastrophic fragmentation. Researchers identify the cause as a single cross-attention activation and develop PowerRemap to stabilize outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable surface completion from sparse point clouds is crucial for content creation and robotics, but state-of-the-art 3D diffusion transformers exhibit a catastrophic failure mode where tiny input perturbations cause output fragmentation.

Method: Used activation-patching from mechanistic interpretability to localize the failure to a single early denoising cross-attention activation. Analyzed its singular-value spectrum to develop a scalar proxy (spectral entropy) that tracks fragmentation. Introduced PowerRemap, a test-time control method to stabilize conditioning.

Result: Identified Meltdown phenomenon across multiple architectures (WaLa, Make-a-Shape), datasets (GSO, SimJEB), and denoising strategies (DDPM, DDIM). PowerRemap achieved up to 98.3% stabilization rate against Meltdown failures.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates how mechanistic analysis of diffusion models can link circuit-level mechanisms (cross-attention) to diffusion dynamics (trajectory bifurcations), enabling effective failure diagnosis and correction through targeted interventions like PowerRemap.

Abstract: Reliable surface completion from sparse point clouds underpins many applications spanning content creation and robotics. While 3D diffusion transformers attain state-of-the-art results on this task, we uncover that they exhibit a catastrophic mode of failure: arbitrarily small on-surface perturbations to the input point cloud can fracture the output into multiple disconnected pieces -- a phenomenon we call Meltdown. Using activation-patching from mechanistic interpretability, we localize Meltdown to a single early denoising cross-attention activation. We find that the singular-value spectrum of this activation provides a scalar proxy: its spectral entropy rises when fragmentation occurs and returns to baseline when patched. Interpreted through diffusion dynamics, we show that this proxy tracks a symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the reverse process. Guided by this insight, we introduce PowerRemap, a test-time control that stabilizes sparse point-cloud conditioning. We demonstrate that Meltdown persists across state-of-the-art architectures (WaLa, Make-a-Shape), datasets (GSO, SimJEB) and denoising strategies (DDPM, DDIM), and that PowerRemap effectively counters this failure with stabilization rates of up to 98.3%. Overall, this work is a case study on how diffusion model behavior can be understood and guided based on mechanistic analysis, linking a circuit-level cross-attention mechanism to diffusion-dynamics accounts of trajectory bifurcations.

*Vaisakh Shaj,Cameron Barker,Aidan Scannell,Andras Szecsenyi,Elliot J. Crowley,Amos Storkey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Kalman Linear Attention (KLA), a new sequence modeling layer that combines the probabilistic state estimation of Kalman filters with parallel training capabilities, outperforming existing state-space models and gated linear attention variants on language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-space language models like Mamba and GLA offer computational efficiency but lack expressivity and robust state-tracking for complex reasoning. There's a need for models that combine efficient parallel training with principled probabilistic state estimation and uncertainty tracking.

Method: The authors reframe sequence modeling through a probabilistic lens using Bayesian filters. They reparameterize the Kalman filter in information form to enable associative scan computation, allowing parallel training. This leads to the Kalman Linear Attention (KLA) layer, which performs time-parallel probabilistic inference while maintaining explicit belief-state uncertainty.

Result: KLA offers strictly more expressive nonlinear updates and gating than GLA variants while retaining computational advantages. On language modeling tasks, KLA matches or outperforms modern SSMs and GLAs across representative discrete token-manipulation and state-tracking benchmarks.

Conclusion: The Kalman Linear Attention layer successfully bridges the gap between efficient parallel training and principled probabilistic state estimation, providing a more expressive alternative to existing state-space models while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: State-space language models such as Mamba and gated linear attention (GLA) offer efficient alternatives to transformers due to their linear complexity and parallel training, but often lack the expressivity and robust state-tracking needed for complex reasoning. We address these limitations by reframing sequence modelling through a probabilistic lens, using Bayesian filters as a core primitive. While classical filters such as Kalman filters provide principled state estimation and uncertainty tracking, they are typically viewed as inherently sequential. We show that reparameterising the Kalman filter in information form enables its updates to be computed via an associative scan, allowing efficient parallel training. Building on this insight, we introduce the Kalman Linear Attention (KLA) layer, a neural sequence-modelling primitive that performs time-parallel probabilistic inference while maintaining explicit belief-state uncertainty. KLA offers strictly more expressive nonlinear updates and gating than GLA variants while retaining their computational advantages. On language modelling tasks, KLA matches or outperforms modern SSMs and GLAs across representative discrete token-manipulation and state-tracking benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GENIUS is a new benchmark for evaluating Generative Fluid Intelligence (GFI) in multimodal models, focusing on pattern induction, constraint execution, and contextual adaptation rather than just recalling learned knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) mainly assess crystallized intelligence (recalling accumulated knowledge), overlooking generative fluid intelligence - the ability to induce patterns, reason through constraints, and adapt to novel scenarios on the fly.

Method: The authors introduce GENIUS benchmark that formalizes GFI as three primitives: 1) Inducing Implicit Patterns (inferring personalized visual preferences), 2) Executing Ad-hoc Constraints (visualizing abstract metaphors), and 3) Adapting to Contextual Knowledge (simulating counter-intuitive physics). They evaluate 12 representative models and propose a training-free attention intervention strategy.

Result: Evaluation of 12 models reveals significant performance deficits in GFI tasks. Diagnostic analysis shows failures stem from limited context comprehension rather than insufficient intrinsic generative capability.

Conclusion: GENIUS establishes a rigorous standard for evaluating Generative Fluid Intelligence, guiding the field beyond knowledge utilization toward dynamic, general-purpose reasoning. The benchmark and code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual generation. Yet, existing benchmarks predominantly assess $\textit{Crystallized Intelligence}$, which relies on recalling accumulated knowledge and learned schemas. This focus overlooks $\textit{Generative Fluid Intelligence (GFI)}$: the capacity to induce patterns, reason through constraints, and adapt to novel scenarios on the fly. To rigorously assess this capability, we introduce $\textbf{GENIUS}$ ($\textbf{GEN}$ Fluid $\textbf{I}$ntelligence Eval$\textbf{U}$ation $\textbf{S}$uite). We formalize $\textit{GFI}$ as a synthesis of three primitives. These include $\textit{Inducing Implicit Patterns}$ (e.g., inferring personalized visual preferences), $\textit{Executing Ad-hoc Constraints}$ (e.g., visualizing abstract metaphors), and $\textit{Adapting to Contextual Knowledge}$ (e.g., simulating counter-intuitive physics). Collectively, these primitives challenge models to solve problems grounded entirely in the immediate context. Our systematic evaluation of 12 representative models reveals significant performance deficits in these tasks. Crucially, our diagnostic analysis disentangles these failure modes. It demonstrates that deficits stem from limited context comprehension rather than insufficient intrinsic generative capability. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free attention intervention strategy. Ultimately, $\textbf{GENIUS}$ establishes a rigorous standard for $\textit{GFI}$, guiding the field beyond knowledge utilization toward dynamic, general-purpose reasoning. Our dataset and code will be released at: $\href{https://github.com/arctanxarc/GENIUS}{https://github.com/arctanxarc/GENIUS}$.

### [189] [Predicting integers from continuous parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10751)
*Bas Maat,Peter Bloem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes modeling integer-valued labels directly with discrete distributions rather than treating them as continuous, introducing novel distributions like Bitwise and discrete Laplace for neural network training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integer labels (like up-vote counts, bike availability) are often modeled as continuous values in regression, but this changes the underlying discrete distribution. Discrete distributions preserve the integer nature and may offer benefits, but need continuous parameters for neural network training via backpropagation.

Method: Investigate several discrete distributions with continuous parameters suitable for neural networks, including existing and novel options. Focus on distributions that can be learned via gradient descent, testing Bitwise (binary representation with Bernoulli per bit) and discrete Laplace (exponentially decaying tails around continuous mean).

Result: Tested on tabular learning, sequential prediction, and image generation tasks. Found that Bitwise and discrete Laplace distributions perform best overall among the investigated options.

Conclusion: Direct modeling of integer labels with discrete distributions is feasible and beneficial, with Bitwise and discrete Laplace distributions showing superior performance for neural network applications requiring gradient-based optimization.

Abstract: We study the problem of predicting numeric labels that are constrained to the integers or to a subrange of the integers. For example, the number of up-votes on social media posts, or the number of bicycles available at a public rental station. While it is possible to model these as continuous values, and to apply traditional regression, this approach changes the underlying distribution on the labels from discrete to continuous. Discrete distributions have certain benefits, which leads us to the question whether such integer labels can be modeled directly by a discrete distribution, whose parameters are predicted from the features of a given instance. Moreover, we focus on the use case of output distributions of neural networks, which adds the requirement that the parameters of the distribution be continuous so that backpropagation and gradient descent may be used to learn the weights of the network. We investigate several options for such distributions, some existing and some novel, and test them on a range of tasks, including tabular learning, sequential prediction and image generation. We find that overall the best performance comes from two distributions: Bitwise, which represents the target integer in bits and places a Bernoulli distribution on each, and a discrete analogue of the Laplace distribution, which uses a distribution with exponentially decaying tails around a continuous mean.

### [190] [Collaborative Threshold Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10765)
*Tameem Bakr,Anish Ambreth,Nils Lukas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes (t,K)-threshold watermarking for federated learning where clients collaboratively embed a shared watermark, requiring at least t clients to verify it, preventing individual clients from removing watermarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In federated learning, clients need to prove model provenance but existing watermarking approaches either don't scale well with many clients (watermarks dilute) or give individual clients too much power to verify/remove watermarks.

Method: Introduces (t,K)-threshold watermarking where clients collaboratively embed a shared watermark during training. Uses secret-sharing of watermark key τ so that only coalitions of at least t clients can reconstruct it. Verification can be performed without revealing τ in clear. Instantiated in white-box setting for image classification.

Result: Watermark remains detectable at scale (K=128 clients) with minimal accuracy loss. Stays above detection threshold (z≥4) under attacks including adaptive fine-tuning using up to 20% of training data.

Conclusion: Threshold watermarking provides scalable, secure provenance verification for federated learning models while preventing individual clients from compromising the watermark.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), $K$ clients jointly train a model without sharing raw data. Because each participant invests data and compute, clients need mechanisms to later prove the provenance of a jointly trained model. Model watermarking embeds a hidden signal in the weights, but naive approaches either do not scale with many clients as per-client watermarks dilute as $K$ grows, or give any individual client the ability to verify and potentially remove the watermark. We introduce $(t,K)$-threshold watermarking: clients collaboratively embed a shared watermark during training, while only coalitions of at least $t$ clients can reconstruct the watermark key and verify a suspect model. We secret-share the watermark key $τ$ so that coalitions of fewer than $t$ clients cannot reconstruct it, and verification can be performed without revealing $τ$ in the clear. We instantiate our protocol in the white-box setting and evaluate on image classification. Our watermark remains detectable at scale ($K=128$) with minimal accuracy loss and stays above the detection threshold ($z\ge 4$) under attacks including adaptive fine-tuning using up to 20% of the training data.

*Frank Xiao,Santiago Aranguri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Activation-based data attribution traces model behavior changes to specific training datapoints using activation differences and cosine similarity, enabling identification and mitigation of harmful behaviors like distractor-triggered compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for tracing behavioral changes in post-trained language models back to responsible training datapoints, enabling causal validation and addressing harmful emergent behaviors that arise from contaminated preference data rather than deliberate injection.

Method: Compute activation-difference vectors for test prompts and preference pairs, rank datapoints by cosine similarity, validate attributions causally by retraining with modified data, and cluster behavior-datapoint similarity matrices for unsupervised discovery of emergent behaviors.

Result: Applied to OLMo 2's DPO training, discovered "distractor-triggered compliance" - harmful behavior where model complies with dangerous requests when benign formatting instructions are appended. Filtering top-ranked datapoints reduces this behavior by 63%, while switching their labels achieves 78% reduction. Method outperforms gradient-based attribution and LLM-judge baselines while being over 10 times cheaper.

Conclusion: Activation-based data attribution provides an effective, efficient method for identifying and mitigating harmful model behaviors by tracing them to specific training datapoints, offering a realistic benchmark for safety techniques through in-the-wild model organisms emerging from contaminated preference data.

Abstract: We propose activation-based data attribution, a method that traces behavioral changes in post-trained language models to responsible training datapoints. By computing activation-difference vectors for both test prompts and preference pairs and ranking by cosine similarity, we identify datapoints that cause specific behaviors and validate these attributions causally by retraining with modified data. Clustering behavior-datapoint similarity matrices also enables unsupervised discovery of emergent behaviors. Applying this to OLMo 2's production DPO training, we surfaced distractor-triggered compliance: a harmful behavior where the model complies with dangerous requests when benign formatting instructions are appended. Filtering top-ranked datapoints reduces this behavior by 63% while switching their labels achieves 78%. Our method outperforms gradient-based attribution and LLM-judge baselines while being over 10 times cheaper than both. This in-the-wild model organism - emerging from contaminated preference data rather than deliberate injection - provides a realistic benchmark for safety techniques.

*Yuheng Luo,Shuyan Li,Zhong Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRASP is a new feature selection method for medical prediction that combines SHAP importance scores with group L21 regularization to select compact, non-redundant features while maintaining predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature selection methods like LASSO lack robustness and interpretability in medical prediction tasks. There's a need for methods that can extract compact, non-redundant feature sets while maintaining predictive performance.

Method: GRASP couples Shapley value (SHAP) driven attribution with group L21 regularization. It first distills group-level importance scores from a pretrained tree model using SHAP, then enforces structured sparsity through group L21 regularized logistic regression to select stable and interpretable features.

Result: GRASP consistently delivers comparable or superior predictive accuracy compared to LASSO, SHAP, and deep learning methods, while identifying fewer, less redundant, and more stable features.

Conclusion: GRASP provides a robust and interpretable feature selection framework for medical prediction that addresses limitations of existing methods by combining SHAP attribution with structured regularization.

Abstract: Feature selection remains a major challenge in medical prediction, where existing approaches such as LASSO often lack robustness and interpretability. We introduce GRASP, a novel framework that couples Shapley value driven attribution with group $L_{21}$ regularization to extract compact and non-redundant feature sets. GRASP first distills group level importance scores from a pretrained tree model via SHAP, then enforces structured sparsity through group $L_{21}$ regularized logistic regression, yielding stable and interpretable selections. Extensive comparisons with LASSO, SHAP, and deep learning based methods show that GRASP consistently delivers comparable or superior predictive accuracy, while identifying fewer, less redundant, and more stable features.

### [193] [General Flexible $f$-divergence for Challenging Offline RL Datasets with Low Stochasticity and Diverse Behavior Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11087)
*Jianxun Wang,Grant C. Forbes,Leonardo Villalobos-Arias,David L. Roberts*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a flexible f-divergence formulation for offline RL that adaptively constrains learning objectives based on dataset characteristics, balancing RL optimization with behavior policy constraints for challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical offline datasets often have limited diversity, limited exploration, and come from multiple behavior policies with varying expertise. This makes standard offline RL approaches either too conservative (when constraining to diverse policies) or unable to properly estimate Q/V values (due to limited exploration).

Method: 1) Identifies connection between f-divergence and Bellman residual constraints through a general Linear Programming form for RL and convex conjugate analysis. 2) Introduces flexible f-divergence formulation that adaptively constrains learning objectives based on dataset characteristics. 3) Applies this to compatible constrained optimization algorithms.

Result: Experiments on MuJoCo, Fetch, and AdroitHand environments show: 1) Correctness of the proposed LP form, and 2) The flexible f-divergence improves performance when learning from challenging datasets.

Conclusion: The flexible f-divergence formulation provides an effective way to balance RL objectives with behavior policy constraints for offline RL, particularly beneficial for datasets with limited exploration and diverse behavior policies.

Abstract: Offline RL algorithms aim to improve upon the behavior policy that produces the collected data while constraining the learned policy to be within the support of the dataset. However, practical offline datasets often contain examples with little diversity or limited exploration of the environment, and from multiple behavior policies with diverse expertise levels. Limited exploration can impair the offline RL algorithm's ability to estimate \textit{Q} or \textit{V} values, while constraining towards diverse behavior policies can be overly conservative. Such datasets call for a balance between the RL objective and behavior policy constraints. We first identify the connection between $f$-divergence and optimization constraint on the Bellman residual through a more general Linear Programming form for RL and the convex conjugate. Following this, we introduce the general flexible function formulation for the $f$-divergence to incorporate an adaptive constraint on algorithms' learning objectives based on the offline training dataset. Results from experiments on the MuJoCo, Fetch, and AdroitHand environments show the correctness of the proposed LP form and the potential of the flexible $f$-divergence in improving performance for learning from a challenging dataset when applied to a compatible constrained optimization algorithm.

### [194] [Direct Learning of Calibration-Aware Uncertainty for Neural PDE Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11090)
*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cross-regularized uncertainty learning framework for neural PDE surrogates that optimizes uncertainty parameters on a held-out regularization split to reduce train-test mismatch, yielding regime-adaptive uncertainty without per-regime tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural PDE surrogates need calibrated uncertainty in data-limited or partially observed regimes where downstream decisions depend on reliable uncertainty estimates, but existing approaches rely on ensemble replication, fixed stochastic noise, or post hoc calibration which may not adapt to different regimes.

Method: Cross-regularized uncertainty learning uses a held-out regularization split during training. The predictor is optimized on the training split for fit, while low-dimensional uncertainty controls are optimized on the regularization split to reduce train-test mismatch. The framework can learn continuous noise levels at output heads, within hidden features, or within operator-specific components like spectral modes. Implemented in Fourier Neural Operators.

Result: Evaluated on APEBench sweeps over observed fraction and training-set size. Across these sweeps, the learned predictive distributions show better calibration on held-out splits, and the resulting uncertainty fields concentrate in high-error regions in one-step spatial diagnostics.

Conclusion: Cross-regularized uncertainty learning provides regime-adaptive uncertainty for neural PDE surrogates without per-regime noise tuning, improving calibration and concentrating uncertainty in high-error regions.

Abstract: Neural PDE surrogates are often deployed in data-limited or partially observed regimes where downstream decisions depend on calibrated uncertainty in addition to low prediction error. Existing approaches obtain uncertainty through ensemble replication, fixed stochastic noise such as dropout, or post hoc calibration. Cross-regularized uncertainty learns uncertainty parameters during training using gradients routed through a held-out regularization split. The predictor is optimized on the training split for fit, while low-dimensional uncertainty controls are optimized on the regularization split to reduce train-test mismatch, yielding regime-adaptive uncertainty without per-regime noise tuning. The framework can learn continuous noise levels at the output head, within hidden features, or within operator-specific components such as spectral modes. We instantiate the approach in Fourier Neural Operators and evaluate on APEBench sweeps over observed fraction and training-set size. Across these sweeps, the learned predictive distributions are better calibrated on held-out splits and the resulting uncertainty fields concentrate in high-error regions in one-step spatial diagnostics.

### [195] [Weight Decay Improves Language Model Plasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11137)
*Tessa Han,Sebastian Bordt,Hanlin Zhang,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Weight decay during pretraining improves model plasticity - models with larger weight decay adapt better to downstream tasks despite potentially worse base performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM development focuses on base model validation loss but ignores downstream adaptability. Need to study pretraining from perspective of model plasticity - ability to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning.

Method: Systematic experiments studying the role of weight decay during pretraining, focusing on how it affects model plasticity and downstream task performance after fine-tuning.

Result: Models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, showing larger performance gains when fine-tuned. Counterintuitive trade-offs: base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Weight decay encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting.

Conclusion: Importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization. Single optimization hyperparameter (weight decay) plays multifaceted role in shaping model behavior and downstream adaptability.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm in large language model (LLM) development is to pretrain a base model, then perform further training to improve performance and model behavior. However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that a single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior.

### [196] [PRISM: Parallel Residual Iterative Sequence Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10796)
*Jie Jiang,Ke Cheng,Xin Xu,Mengyang Pang,Tianhao Lu,Jiaheng Li,Yue Liu,Yuan Wang,Jun Zhang,Huan Yu,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM is a parallelizable sequence model that combines Transformer expressivity with linear model efficiency using solver-inspired iterative refinement in a parallelizable form, achieving 174x higher throughput than explicit optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a fundamental tension between the expressivity of Transformers (which are powerful but inefficient) and the efficiency of linear sequence models (which are fast but theoretically limited). Existing efficient architectures are bounded by shallow, single-step linear updates, while powerful iterative methods like Test-Time Training break hardware parallelism due to state-dependent gradients.

Method: PRISM introduces a solver-inspired inductive bias with Write-Forget Decoupling that isolates non-linearity within the injection operator. It uses a two-stage proxy architecture: short-convolution anchors the initial residual using local history energy, while a learned predictor estimates refinement updates directly from input. This distills structural patterns of iterative correction into a parallelizable feedforward operator.

Result: Theoretically, PRISM achieves Rank-L accumulation, expanding beyond the single-step Rank-1 bottleneck. Empirically, it achieves comparable performance to explicit optimization methods while achieving 174x higher throughput.

Conclusion: PRISM resolves the tension between expressivity and efficiency in generative sequence modeling by capturing multi-step refinement properties in a parallelizable form, offering both theoretical advantages and practical speed improvements.

Abstract: Generative sequence modeling faces a fundamental tension between the expressivity of Transformers and the efficiency of linear sequence models. Existing efficient architectures are theoretically bounded by shallow, single-step linear updates, while powerful iterative methods like Test-Time Training (TTT) break hardware parallelism due to state-dependent gradients. We propose PRISM (Parallel Residual Iterative Sequence Model) to resolve this tension. PRISM introduces a solver-inspired inductive bias that captures key structural properties of multi-step refinement in a parallelizable form. We employ a Write-Forget Decoupling strategy that isolates non-linearity within the injection operator. To bypass the serial dependency of explicit solvers, PRISM utilizes a two-stage proxy architecture: a short-convolution anchors the initial residual using local history energy, while a learned predictor estimates the refinement updates directly from the input. This design distills structural patterns associated with iterative correction into a parallelizable feedforward operator. Theoretically, we prove that this formulation achieves Rank-$L$ accumulation, structurally expanding the update manifold beyond the single-step Rank-$1$ bottleneck. Empirically, it achieves comparable performance to explicit optimization methods while achieving 174x higher throughput.

*Linxuan Xia,Xiaolong Yang,Yongyuan Chen,Enyue Zhao,Deng Cai,Yasheng Wang,Boxi Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePO (Rephrasing Policy Optimization) is a new RL method that improves domain-specific LLM alignment by having models rephrase off-policy knowledge into on-policy trajectories, balancing knowledge absorption with training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for aligning LLMs on domain-specific data have trade-offs: SFT degrades generality, on-policy RL can't handle hard samples, and off-policy RL suffers from training instability due to distribution shift.

Method: RePO prompts the policy model to first comprehend off-policy knowledge, then rephrase it into trajectories matching its own stylistic and parametric distribution. These rephrased high-quality trajectories replace low-reward rollouts while preserving on-policy training dynamics.

Result: RePO improves hard-sample utilization and outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: RePO successfully reconciles effective off-policy knowledge absorption with on-policy RL stability, providing a better approach for domain-specific LLM alignment.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific data remains a fundamental challenge. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers a straightforward way to inject domain knowledge but often degrades the model's generality. In contrast, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) preserves generality but fails to effectively assimilate hard samples that exceed the model's current reasoning level. Recent off-policy RL attempts improve hard sample utilization, yet they suffer from severe training instability due to the forced distribution shift toward off-policy knowledge. To reconcile effective off-policy knowledge absorption with the stability of on-policy RL, we propose Rephrasing Policy Optimization (RePO). In RePO, the policy model is prompted to first comprehend off-policy knowledge and then rephrase it into trajectories that conform to its own stylistic and parametric distribution. RePO dynamically replaces low-reward rollouts with these rephrased, high-quality trajectories. This strategy guides the model toward correct reasoning paths while strictly preserving on-policy training dynamics. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that RePO improves hard-sample utilization and outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

### [198] [Adaptive Sampling for Private Worst-Case Group Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10820)
*Max Cairney-Leeming,Amartya Sanyal,Christoph H. Lampert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASC algorithm provides differentially private worst-case group optimization with adaptive sampling and clipping, ensuring consistent privacy across groups while improving worst-case accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard models often fail on minority/hard-to-learn groups. Existing worst-case group optimization methods create privacy issues with differential privacy, leading to weaker privacy for minority groups due to unequal data weighting.

Method: ASC (Adaptively Sampled and Clipped Worst-case Group Optimization) algorithm that adaptively controls both sampling rate and clipping threshold for each group, allowing harder-to-learn groups to be sampled more often while maintaining consistent privacy guarantees.

Result: ASC achieves lower-variance gradients, tighter privacy guarantees, and substantially higher worst-case group accuracy without sacrificing overall average accuracy compared to prior work.

Conclusion: ASC successfully addresses the privacy-fairness trade-off in worst-case group optimization by providing adaptive sampling and clipping that ensures consistent privacy protection while improving performance on minority groups.

Abstract: Models trained by minimizing the average loss often fail to be accurate on small or hard-to-learn groups of the data. Various methods address this issue by optimizing a weighted objective that focuses on the worst-performing groups. However, this approach becomes problematic when learning with differential privacy, as unequal data weighting can result in inhomogeneous privacy guarantees, in particular weaker privacy for minority groups. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for differentially private worst-case group optimization called ASC (Adaptively Sampled and Clipped Worst-case Group Optimization). It adaptively controls both the sampling rate and the clipping threshold of each group. Thereby, it allows for harder-to-learn groups to be sampled more often while ensuring consistent privacy guarantees across all groups. Comparing ASC to prior work, we show that it results in lower-variance gradients, tighter privacy guarantees, and substantially higher worst-case group accuracy without sacrificing overall average accuracy.

Result: Even the strongest LLM achieved only 21.5% pass rate on physical simulation tasks, demonstrating significant difficulty. Training with SimuScene data improved physical simulation via code while substantially enhancing general code generation performance.

Conclusion: Physical simulation via code is challenging for current LLMs, but can be improved through targeted training with visual rewards. The SimuScene benchmark provides a systematic framework for evaluating and advancing LLMs' physical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively studied for tasks like math competitions, complex coding, and scientific reasoning, yet their ability to accurately represent and simulate physical scenarios via code remains underexplored. We propose SimuScene, the first systematic study that trains and evaluates LLMs on simulating physical scenarios across five physics domains and 52 physical concepts. We build an automatic pipeline to collect data, with human verification to ensure quality. The final dataset contains 7,659 physical scenarios with 334 human-verified examples as the test set. We evaluated 10 contemporary LLMs and found that even the strongest model achieves only a 21.5% pass rate, demonstrating the difficulty of the task. Finally, we introduce a reinforcement learning pipeline with visual rewards that uses a vision-language model as a judge to train textual models. Experiments show that training with our data improves physical simulation via code while substantially enhancing general code generation performance.

TL;DR: Near-dimensional-invariant sample complexity for learning n-dimensional CDFs with one-bit feedback: O(1/ε³ * log(1/ε)^O(n)) samples needed for uniform ε-approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend multivariate DKW inequality from full feedback to bandit feedback setting, where only minimal one-bit observations are available. Study sample complexity of learning CDFs under limited feedback.

Method: Analyze learning of n-dimensional cumulative distribution functions with one-bit feedback, establishing sample complexity bounds for uniform approximation over arbitrary fine grids.

Result: Main result shows near-dimensional-invariance: sample complexity is O(1/ε³ * log(1/ε)^O(n)), where dimensionality n only affects logarithmic terms. Provides tight bounds for learning fixed-price mechanisms in small markets.

Conclusion: Dimensionality has minimal impact on sample complexity under bandit feedback, enabling efficient learning of CDFs and applications to mechanism design like bilateral trade settings.

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of learning a uniform approximation of an $n$-dimensional cumulative distribution function (CDF) within an error $ε> 0$, when observations are restricted to a minimal one-bit feedback. This serves as a counterpart to the multivariate DKW inequality under ''full feedback'', extending it to the setting of ''bandit feedback''. Our main result shows a near-dimensional-invariance in the sample complexity: we get a uniform $ε$-approximation with a sample complexity $\frac{1}{ε^3}{\log\left(\frac 1 ε\right)^{\mathcal{O}(n)}}$ over a arbitrary fine grid, where the dimensionality $n$ only affects logarithmic terms. As direct corollaries, we provide tight sample complexity bounds and novel regret guarantees for learning fixed-price mechanisms in small markets, such as bilateral trade settings.

TL;DR: NHGD is a new bilevel optimization method that uses empirical Fisher information as a Hessian surrogate, enabling parallel optimization with reduced computational overhead while maintaining theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational bottleneck in bilevel optimization is hypergradient estimation, which requires computing or approximating Hessian inverses. Current methods are computationally expensive, limiting scalability in large-scale machine learning settings.

Method: NHGD exploits the statistical structure of inner optimization problems by using empirical Fisher information matrix as an asymptotically consistent surrogate for the Hessian. This enables a parallel optimize-and-approximate framework where Hessian-inverse approximation updates synchronously with stochastic inner optimization, reusing gradient information at negligible additional cost.

Result: Theoretical analysis establishes high-probability error bounds and sample complexity guarantees matching state-of-the-art optimize-then-approximate methods. Empirical evaluations on representative bilevel learning tasks demonstrate practical advantages, including scalability and effectiveness in large-scale settings.

Conclusion: NHGD provides an efficient solution to bilevel optimization that significantly reduces computational time overhead while maintaining theoretical guarantees, making it suitable for large-scale machine learning applications.

Abstract: In this work, we propose Natural Hypergradient Descent (NHGD), a new method for solving bilevel optimization problems. To address the computational bottleneck in hypergradient estimation--namely, the need to compute or approximate Hessian inverse--we exploit the statistical structure of the inner optimization problem and use the empirical Fisher information matrix as an asymptotically consistent surrogate for the Hessian. This design enables a parallel optimize-and-approximate framework in which the Hessian-inverse approximation is updated synchronously with the stochastic inner optimization, reusing gradient information at negligible additional cost. Our main theoretical contribution establishes high-probability error bounds and sample complexity guarantees for NHGD that match those of state-of-the-art optimize-then-approximate methods, while significantly reducing computational time overhead.

### [203] [Tuning the burn-in phase in training recurrent neural networks improves their performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10911)
*Julian D. Schiller,Malte Heinrich,Victor G. Lopez,Matthias A. Müller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Truncated BPTT for RNNs reduces computational overhead but requires careful burn-in phase tuning to maintain performance, with theoretical bounds showing up to 60% error reduction when properly configured.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard BPTT for RNNs is computationally expensive with long sequences, so truncated BPTT over shorter segments offers a practical alternative, but its theoretical performance guarantees need investigation.

Method: The paper establishes theoretical bounds on accuracy and performance loss when optimizing RNNs over subsequences instead of full sequences, focusing on the burn-in phase as a key tuning parameter, and validates through experiments on system identification and time series forecasting benchmarks.

Result: Theoretical analysis reveals burn-in phase significantly impacts performance guarantees, with experiments showing proper tuning can reduce prediction error by over 60% on both training and test data across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Truncated BPTT is a viable alternative to full BPTT for RNN training, but careful tuning of the burn-in phase is crucial for achieving optimal performance, with theoretical bounds providing guidance for practical implementation.

Abstract: Training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with standard backpropagation through time (BPTT) can be challenging, especially in the presence of long input sequences. A practical alternative to reduce computational and memory overhead is to perform BPTT repeatedly over shorter segments of the training data set, corresponding to truncated BPTT. In this paper, we examine the training of RNNs when using such a truncated learning approach for time series tasks. Specifically, we establish theoretical bounds on the accuracy and performance loss when optimizing over subsequences instead of the full data sequence. This reveals that the burn-in phase of the RNN is an important tuning knob in its training, with significant impact on the performance guarantees. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on standard benchmarks from the fields of system identification and time series forecasting. In all experiments, we observe a strong influence of the burn-in phase on the training process, and proper tuning can lead to a reduction of the prediction error on the training and test data of more than 60% in some cases.

*Qian Zuo,Zhiyong Wang,Fengxiang He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlexDOME algorithm achieves near-constant strong constraint violation with sublinear strong regret and non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence in safe online RL for CMDPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing primal-dual methods for safe online RL in CMDPs either incur growing strong constraint violation or are restricted to average-iterate convergence due to oscillations, creating limitations for practical applications requiring strict safety guarantees.

Method: FlexDOME algorithm incorporates time-varying safety margins and regularization terms into the primal-dual framework, using a novel term-wise asymptotic dominance strategy where safety margins are scheduled to asymptotically majorize functional decay rates of optimization and statistical errors.

Result: FlexDOME is the first algorithm to provably achieve near-constant Õ(1) strong constraint violation alongside sublinear strong regret and non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence, with experimental validation.

Conclusion: The proposed FlexDOME algorithm successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by achieving both strong safety guarantees (near-constant violation) and optimization performance (sublinear regret) with last-iterate convergence, advancing safe online RL theory.

Abstract: We study safe online reinforcement learning in Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under strong regret and violation metrics, which forbid error cancellation over time. Existing primal-dual methods that achieve sublinear strong reward regret inevitably incur growing strong constraint violation or are restricted to average-iterate convergence due to inherent oscillations. To address these limitations, we propose the Flexible safety Domain Optimization via Margin-regularized Exploration (FlexDOME) algorithm, the first to provably achieve near-constant $\tilde{O}(1)$ strong constraint violation alongside sublinear strong regret and non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence. FlexDOME incorporates time-varying safety margins and regularization terms into the primal-dual framework. Our theoretical analysis relies on a novel term-wise asymptotic dominance strategy, where the safety margin is rigorously scheduled to asymptotically majorize the functional decay rates of the optimization and statistical errors, thereby clamping cumulative violations to a near-constant level. Furthermore, we establish non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees via a policy-dual Lyapunov argument. Experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.

*Vasilii Starikov,Ruslan Kozliak,Georgii Kontsevik,Sergey Mityagin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SM imputer tool combines morphological clustering with spatial methods to reconstruct missing FSI/GSI values at city block level, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate reconstruction of missing morphological indicators (FSI and GSI) is crucial for urban planning and data-driven analysis, but existing methods may not fully capture both global morphological patterns and local spatial context.

Method: Combines data-driven morphological clustering (global priors from city-scale patterns) with neighborhood-based spatial methods (IDW and sKNN) for context-dependent interpolation, inspired by SpaceMatrix framework.

Result: SM alone captures meaningful morphological structure, but its combination with IDW or sKNN provides superior performance compared to existing SOTA models. Composite methods show complementary advantages of morphological and spatial approaches.

Conclusion: The spatial-morphological imputer effectively reconstructs missing urban morphological indicators by combining global morphological patterns with local spatial information, demonstrating that hybrid approaches outperform single-method solutions.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of missing morphological indicators of a city is crucial for urban planning and data-driven analysis. This study presents the spatial-morphological (SM) imputer tool, which combines data-driven morphological clustering with neighborhood-based methods to reconstruct missing values of the floor space index (FSI) and ground space index (GSI) at the city block level, inspired by the SpaceMatrix framework. This approach combines city-scale morphological patterns as global priors with local spatial information for context-dependent interpolation. The evaluation shows that while SM alone captures meaningful morphological structure, its combination with inverse distance weighting (IDW) or spatial k-nearest neighbor (sKNN) methods provides superior performance compared to existing SOTA models. Composite methods demonstrate the complementary advantages of combining morphological and spatial approaches.

*Riccardo Barbano,Alexander Denker,Zeljko Kereta,Runchang Li,Francisco Vargas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a cooperative Stochastic Optimal Control framework for compositional generation with multiple pre-trained diffusion models, treating them as interacting agents rather than combining probability densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to controlling composition of multiple pre-trained models treat composition as algebraic combination of probability densities, which assumes explicit knowledge of target distribution - rarely the case. Need a different paradigm for compositional generation.

Method: Formulates compositional generation as cooperative Stochastic Optimal Control problem. Treats pre-trained diffusion models as interacting agents whose diffusion trajectories are jointly steered via optimal control toward shared objective defined on aggregated output.

Result: Validated on conditional MNIST generation. Compared against naive inference-time DPS-style baseline that replaces learned cooperative control with per-step gradient guidance.

Conclusion: Proposes novel paradigm shift from algebraic composition of probability densities to cooperative optimal control of interacting diffusion agents for compositional generation.

Abstract: Continuous-time generative models have achieved remarkable success in image restoration and synthesis. However, controlling the composition of multiple pre-trained models remains an open challenge. Current approaches largely treat composition as an algebraic composition of probability densities, such as via products or mixtures of experts. This perspective assumes the target distribution is known explicitly, which is almost never the case. In this work, we propose a different paradigm that formulates compositional generation as a cooperative Stochastic Optimal Control problem. Rather than combining probability densities, we treat pre-trained diffusion models as interacting agents whose diffusion trajectories are jointly steered, via optimal control, toward a shared objective defined on their aggregated output. We validate our framework on conditional MNIST generation and compare it against a naive inference-time DPS-style baseline replacing learned cooperative control with per-step gradient guidance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Temporal attention mechanisms suffer from diagonal attention sink bias, where attention focuses excessively on early tokens. The paper analyzes this theoretically and proposes regularization methods to address it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatio-temporal models are prone to information degeneration across space and time. Prior work shows over-squashing in causal attention or temporal convolutions creates bias toward first tokens. The authors want to investigate if similar bias exists in temporal attention mechanisms.

Method: Derived sensitivity bounds on the expected value of the Jacobian of a temporal attention layer. Theoretically analyzed how off-diagonal attention scores depend on sequence length. Showed temporal attention matrices suffer from diagonal attention sink. Proposed regularization methods to address this issue.

Result: Theoretical analysis demonstrates that temporal attention mechanisms indeed suffer from diagonal attention sink bias, where attention focuses excessively on early tokens. This bias depends on sequence length. The proposed regularization methods are experimentally shown to be effective.

Conclusion: Temporal attention mechanisms exhibit diagonal attention sink bias similar to other spatio-temporal models. This theoretical understanding enables the development of regularization techniques to mitigate the bias and improve model performance.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal models analyze spatial structures and temporal dynamics, which makes them prone to information degeneration among space and time. Prior literature has demonstrated that over-squashing in causal attention or temporal convolutions creates a bias on the first tokens. To analyze whether such a bias is present in temporal attention mechanisms, we derive sensitivity bounds on the expected value of the Jacobian of a temporal attention layer. We theoretically show how off-diagonal attention scores depend on the sequence length, and that temporal attention matrices suffer a diagonal attention sink. We suggest regularization methods, and experimentally demonstrate their effectiveness.

*Yupu Gu,Rongzhe Wei,Andy Zhu,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoEEdit: First routing-stable knowledge editing framework for sparse Mixture-of-Experts LLMs that prevents routing distribution shifts through null-space projections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge editing methods are designed for dense LLM architectures and don't work well for sparse MoE models, which are increasingly prevalent in scalable LLMs. Naive adaptation causes routing distribution shifts that undermine stability and consistency.

Method: Reparameterizes expert updates via per-expert null-space projections to keep router inputs invariant, suppressing routing shifts. Uses block coordinate descent solver for efficient block-structured optimization.

Result: MoEEdit achieves state-of-the-art efficacy and generalization while preserving high specificity and routing stability, with superior compute and memory efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Establishes robust foundation for scalable, precise knowledge editing in sparse LLMs and underscores importance of routing-stable interventions for MoE models.

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) enables precise modifications to factual content in large language models (LLMs). Existing KE methods are largely designed for dense architectures, limiting their applicability to the increasingly prevalent sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models that underpin modern scalable LLMs. Although MoEs offer strong efficiency and capacity scaling, naively adapting dense-model editors is both computationally costly and prone to routing distribution shifts that undermine stability and consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce MoEEdit, the first routing-stable framework for parameter-modifying knowledge editing in MoE LLMs. Our method reparameterizes expert updates via per-expert null-space projections that keep router inputs invariant and thereby suppress routing shifts. The resulting block-structured optimization is solved efficiently with a block coordinate descent (BCD) solver. Experiments show that MoEEdit attains state-of-the-art efficacy and generalization while preserving high specificity and routing stability, with superior compute and memory efficiency. These results establish a robust foundation for scalable, precise knowledge editing in sparse LLMs and underscore the importance of routing-stable interventions.

*Sanghwa Kim,Junghyun Lee,Se-Young Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HCW-GLB-OMD algorithm for heteroskedastic generalized linear bandits with adversarial corruptions achieves near-optimal regret with O(1) space/time complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address heteroskedastic generalized linear bandits with adversarial corruptions, which subsumes important bandit settings like heteroskedastic linear bandits and logistic/Poisson bandits, where existing methods may not handle both heteroskedasticity and corruption robustness efficiently.

Method: Propose HCW-GLB-OMD algorithm combining online mirror descent (OMD)-based estimator with Hessian-based confidence weights for corruption robustness. The method is computationally efficient with O(1) space and time complexity per iteration.

Result: Achieves regret bound of Õ(d√∑g(τ_t)μ̇_{t,⋆} + d²g_maxκ + dκC) under self-concordance assumption, with matching lower bound of Ω̃(d√∑g(τ_t)μ̇_{t,⋆} + dC), showing instance-wise minimax optimality up to κ-factor in corruption term.

Conclusion: The algorithm achieves near-optimal performance across various heteroskedastic GLB instances with adversarial corruptions, unifying previous problem-specific results and providing efficient computation with minimal space/time requirements.

Abstract: We consider the problem of heteroskedastic generalized linear bandits (GLBs) with adversarial corruptions, which subsumes various stochastic contextual bandit settings, including heteroskedastic linear bandits and logistic/Poisson bandits. We propose HCW-GLB-OMD, which consists of two components: an online mirror descent (OMD)-based estimator and Hessian-based confidence weights to achieve corruption robustness. This is computationally efficient in that it only requires ${O}(1)$ space and time complexity per iteration. Under the self-concordance assumption on the link function, we show a regret bound of $\tilde{O}\left( d \sqrt{\sum_t g(τ_t) \dotμ_{t,\star}} + d^2 g_{\max} κ+ d κC \right)$, where $\dotμ_{t,\star}$ is the slope of $μ$ around the optimal arm at time $t$, $g(τ_t)$'s are potentially exogenously time-varying dispersions (e.g., $g(τ_t) = σ_t^2$ for heteroskedastic linear bandits, $g(τ_t) = 1$ for Bernoulli and Poisson), $g_{\max} = \max_{t \in [T]} g(τ_t)$ is the maximum dispersion, and $C \geq 0$ is the total corruption budget of the adversary. We complement this with a lower bound of $\tildeΩ(d \sqrt{\sum_t g(τ_t) \dotμ_{t,\star}} + d C)$, unifying previous problem-specific lower bounds. Thus, our algorithm achieves, up to a $κ$-factor in the corruption term, instance-wise minimax optimality simultaneously across various instances of heteroskedastic GLBs with adversarial corruptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Joint Self-Improvement: A joint generative-predictive model with self-improving sampling for efficient molecular optimization under limited evaluation budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative molecular optimization faces two key challenges: (1) sample efficiency is crucial since optimized candidates are rare and expensive to evaluate, and (2) surrogate models suffer from distribution shift as optimization drives candidates increasingly out-of-distribution.

Method: Introduces Joint Self-Improvement with two components: (i) a joint generative-predictive model that aligns the generator with the surrogate to alleviate distribution shift, and (ii) a self-improving sampling scheme that biases the generative part using the predictive model to efficiently generate optimized molecules at inference-time.

Result: Experiments across offline and online molecular optimization benchmarks show that Joint Self-Improvement outperforms state-of-the-art methods under limited evaluation budgets.

Conclusion: Joint Self-Improvement effectively addresses sample efficiency and distribution shift challenges in molecular optimization by combining joint modeling with self-improving sampling, demonstrating superior performance in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Generative molecular optimization aims to design molecules with properties surpassing those of existing compounds. However, such candidates are rare and expensive to evaluate, yielding sample efficiency essential. Additionally, surrogate models introduced to predict molecule evaluations, suffer from distribution shift as optimization drives candidates increasingly out-of-distribution. To address these challenges, we introduce Joint Self-Improvement, which benefits from (i) a joint generative-predictive model and (ii) a self-improving sampling scheme. The former aligns the generator with the surrogate, alleviating distribution shift, while the latter biases the generative part of the joint model using the predictive one to efficiently generate optimized molecules at inference-time. Experiments across offline and online molecular optimization benchmarks demonstrate that Joint Self-Improvement outperforms state-of-the-art methods under limited evaluation budgets.

### [211] [TVCACHE: A Stateful Tool-Value Cache for Post-Training LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10986)
*Abhishek Vijaya Kumar,Bhaskar Kataria,Byungsoo Oh,Emaad Manzoor,Rachee Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TVCACHE is a stateful tool-value cache for LLM agent post-training that reduces idle GPU time by caching tool outputs only when full tool-call sequences match, achieving up to 70% cache hit rates and 6.9X speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tool calls in RL post-training of LLM agents take seconds/minutes, leaving GPUs idle and inflating costs. While many tool invocations repeat across parallel rollouts, naive caching is incorrect because tool outputs depend on environment state from prior interactions.

Method: TVCACHE maintains a tree of observed tool-call sequences and performs longest-prefix matching for cache lookups. A cache hit occurs only when the agent's full tool history matches a previously executed sequence, guaranteeing identical environment state.

Result: On three diverse workloads (terminal-based tasks, SQL generation, and video understanding), TVCACHE achieves cache hit rates of up to 70% and reduces median tool call execution time by up to 6.9X, with no degradation in post-training reward accumulation.

Conclusion: TVCACHE effectively reduces post-training time and cost by intelligently caching tool outputs while maintaining correctness through state-aware sequence matching, making LLM agent post-training more efficient.

Abstract: In RL post-training of LLM agents, calls to external tools take several seconds or even minutes, leaving allocated GPUs idle and inflating post-training time and cost. While many tool invocations repeat across parallel rollouts and could in principle be cached, naively caching their outputs for reuse is incorrect since tool outputs depend on the environment state induced by prior agent interactions. We present TVCACHE, a stateful tool-value cache for LLM agent post-training. TVCACHE maintains a tree of observed tool-call sequences and performs longest-prefix matching for cache lookups: a hit occurs only when the agent's full tool history matches a previously executed sequence, guaranteeing identical environment state. On three diverse workloads-terminal-based tasks, SQL generation, and video understanding. TVCACHE achieves cache hit rates of up to 70% and reduces median tool call execution time by up to 6.9X, with no degradation in post-training reward accumulation.

*Rui Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies multi-view learning and adversarial robustness for next-day gold price prediction using OHLCV charts and technical indicators, finding that late fusion works best and systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve financial prediction by leveraging multi-view representations (price charts and technical indicators) while addressing label noise and evaluating adversarial robustness in real-world trading scenarios.

Method: Construct OHLCV-rendered price charts and technical indicator matrices from SGE gold data (2005-2025). Use leakage-resistant time-block splits with embargo. Apply minimum-movement filter to reduce label ambiguity. Compare early fusion (channel stacking) vs late fusion (dual encoders + fusion head) with cross-view consistency regularization. Evaluate adversarial robustness using FGSM and PGD attacks under view-constrained and joint attack scenarios.

Result: Results depend on label-noise regime with non-monotonic data-noise trade-off. Late fusion provides dominant clean-performance gains while early fusion shows negative transfer. Cross-view regularization has secondary effects. Systems show severe vulnerability to tiny adversarial budgets with strong view asymmetry. Late fusion improves robustness under view-constrained attacks but joint attacks remain challenging.

Conclusion: Multi-view learning with late fusion effectively captures predictive signal in financial data, but adversarial robustness remains a critical concern requiring specialized defenses against view-constrained and joint attacks.

Abstract: We study same-source multi-view learning and adversarial robustness for next-day direction prediction with financial image representations. On Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) spot gold data (2005-2025), we construct two window-aligned views from each rolling window: an OHLCV-rendered price/volume chart and a technical-indicator matrix. To ensure reliable evaluation, we adopt leakage-resistant time-block splits with embargo and use Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). We find that results depend strongly on the label-noise regime: we apply an ex-post minimum-movement filter that discards samples with realized next-day absolute return below tau to define evaluation subsets with reduced near-zero label ambiguity. This induces a non-monotonic data-noise trade-off that can reveal predictive signal but eventually increases variance as sample size shrinks; the filter is used for offline benchmark construction rather than an inference-time decision rule. In the stabilized subsets, fusion is regime dependent: early fusion by channel stacking can exhibit negative transfer, whereas late fusion with dual encoders and a fusion head provides the dominant clean-performance gains; cross-view consistency regularization has secondary, backbone-dependent effects. We further evaluate test-time L-infinity perturbations using FGSM and PGD under two threat scenarios: view-constrained attacks that perturb one view and joint attacks that perturb both. We observe severe vulnerability at tiny budgets with strong view asymmetry. Late fusion consistently improves robustness under view-constrained attacks, but joint attacks remain challenging and can still cause substantial worst-case degradation.

*Efe Kahraman,Giulio Tosato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers tested page ordering methods on shuffled Dutch FOI documents using page embeddings, finding specialized pairwise ranking models work best for documents up to 15 pages, while seq2seq transformers fail on longer documents due to different required ordering strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of automatically ordering shuffled pages in heterogeneous document collections (emails, legal texts, spreadsheets) compiled into single PDFs, where traditional semantic ordering signals are unreliable. This is important for reconstructing the original order of documents released under freedom of information laws.

Method: The study uses page embeddings from 5,461 shuffled WOO (Dutch freedom of information) documents. Five methods are compared: pointer networks, seq2seq transformers, and specialized pairwise ranking models. The research includes ablation studies on positional encodings, attention pattern analysis, and experiments with curriculum learning versus direct training.

Result: The best performing approach successfully reorders documents up to 15 pages, with Kendall's tau ranging from 0.95 for short documents (2-5 pages) to 0.72 for 15 page documents. Seq2seq transformers fail catastrophically on long documents (tau drops from 0.918 to 0.014). Curriculum learning underperforms direct training by 39% on long documents. Model specialization improves performance on longer documents by +0.21 tau.

Conclusion: Specialized pairwise ranking models are most effective for document page ordering, while seq2seq transformers fail on longer documents due to fundamentally different ordering strategies required for short vs. long documents. Attention pattern analysis reveals these different strategies, explaining why curriculum learning fails. Learned positional encodings contribute to seq2seq failure, but multiple interacting causes exist.

Abstract: We investigate document page ordering on 5,461 shuffled WOO documents (Dutch freedom of information releases) using page embeddings. These documents are heterogeneous collections such as emails, legal texts, and spreadsheets compiled into single PDFs, where semantic ordering signals are unreliable. We compare five methods, including pointer networks, seq2seq transformers, and specialized pairwise ranking models. The best performing approach successfully reorders documents up to 15 pages, with Kendall's tau ranging from 0.95 for short documents (2-5 pages) to 0.72 for 15 page documents. We observe two unexpected failures: seq2seq transformers fail to generalize on long documents (Kendall's tau drops from 0.918 on 2-5 pages to 0.014 on 21-25 pages), and curriculum learning underperforms direct training by 39% on long documents. Ablation studies suggest learned positional encodings are one contributing factor to seq2seq failure, though the degradation persists across all encoding variants, indicating multiple interacting causes. Attention pattern analysis reveals that short and long documents require fundamentally different ordering strategies, explaining why curriculum learning fails. Model specialization achieves substantial improvements on longer documents (+0.21 tau).

TL;DR: Pram is the first ML-based method using multimodal language models to solve multi-commodity flow problems, achieving near-optimal solutions with 1-2 orders of magnitude speedup while maintaining strong robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid expansion of allocation systems has created challenges for existing optimization engines in balancing optimality and tractability, creating a trade-off dilemma that service providers need to address.

Method: Pram divides the original MCF problem into local subproblems solved by an MLM-powered agent, then ensures global consistency through multi-agent reinforcement learning. Theoretically, it learns to perform gradient descent in context.

Result: Pram achieves performance comparable to linear programming solvers (very close to optimal), with 1-2 orders of magnitude faster runtimes. It shows strong robustness (<10% performance degradation under failures) and generalization to unforeseen events.

Conclusion: Pram provides a practical, scalable, objective-agnostic solution that seamlessly integrates with mainstream allocation systems, demonstrating MLMs' potential for solving complex optimization problems in future networks.

Abstract: The multi-commodity flow (MCF) problem is a fundamental topic in network flow and combinatorial optimization, with broad applications in transportation, communication, and logistics, etc. Nowadays, the rapid expansion of allocation systems has posed challenges for existing optimization engines in balancing optimality and tractability. In this paper, we present Pram, the first ML-based method that leverages the reasoning power of multimodal language models (MLMs) for addressing the trade-off dilemma -- a great need of service providers. As part of our proposal, Pram (i) quickly computes high-quality allocations by dividing the original problem into local subproblems, which are then resolved by an MLM-powered "agent", and (ii) ensures global consistency by harmonizing these subproblems via a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Theoretically, we show that Pram, which learns to perform gradient descent in context, provably converges to the optimum within the family of MCF problems. Empirically, on real-world datasets and public topologies, Pram achieves performance comparable to, and in some cases even surpassing, linear programming solvers (very close to the optimal solution), and substantially lower runtimes (1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster). Moreover, Pram exhibits strong robustness (<10\% performance degradation under link failures or flow bursts), demonstrating MLM's generalization ability to unforeseen events. Pram is objective-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with mainstream allocation systems, providing a practical and scalable solution for future networks.

TL;DR: MoToRec uses discrete semantic tokenization with sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE to address item cold-start in multimodal recommendation by creating disentangled, interpretable representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data sparsity and item cold-start problems impair GNN-based recommender systems, especially for new items with limited interaction history. While multimodal content offers potential, existing methods produce suboptimal representations due to noise and entanglement in sparse data.

Method: Transforms multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization using MoToRec framework with three components: (1) sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE for disentangled representations, (2) adaptive rarity amplification for prioritized cold-start item learning, and (3) hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios.

Conclusion: Discrete tokenization provides an effective and scalable alternative for mitigating the long-standing cold-start challenge in recommender systems.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized recommender systems by effectively modeling complex user-item interactions, yet data sparsity and the item cold-start problem significantly impair performance, particularly for new items with limited or no interaction history. While multimodal content offers a promising solution, existing methods result in suboptimal representations for new items due to noise and entanglement in sparse data. To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios. Our work validates that discrete tokenization provides an effective and scalable alternative for mitigating the long-standing cold-start challenge.

TL;DR: Synthetic motion data pretraining improves HAR generalization when mixed with real data or scaled sufficiently, but large-scale motion-capture pretraining has limited gains due to domain mismatch with wearable signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world motion data collection for wearable-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is infeasible at scale, but synthetic motion data generated from motion-capture representations offers a potential solution. However, models pretrained on synthetic data often fail to transfer reliably to deployment settings.

Method: Pretrain motion time-series models using synthetic motion data generated from motion-capture-derived representations, then evaluate transfer performance across diverse downstream HAR tasks.

Result: Synthetic pretraining improves generalization when mixed with real data or scaled sufficiently. Large-scale motion-capture pretraining yields only marginal gains due to domain mismatch between motion-capture data and wearable sensor signals.

Conclusion: The study clarifies key sim-to-real challenges in HAR and identifies both the limits and opportunities of synthetic motion data for developing transferable HAR representations, highlighting the importance of addressing domain mismatch between synthetic and wearable signal domains.

Abstract: Synthetic data offers a compelling path to scalable pretraining when real-world data is scarce, but models pretrained on synthetic data often fail to transfer reliably to deployment settings. We study this problem in full-body human motion, where large-scale data collection is infeasible but essential for wearable-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), and where synthetic motion can be generated from motion-capture-derived representations. We pretrain motion time-series models using such synthetic data and evaluate their transfer across diverse downstream HAR tasks. Our results show that synthetic pretraining improves generalisation when mixed with real data or scaled sufficiently. We also demonstrate that large-scale motion-capture pretraining yields only marginal gains due to domain mismatch with wearable signals, clarifying key sim-to-real challenges and the limits and opportunities of synthetic motion data for transferable HAR representations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for remote change detection in LLMs are either too expensive for large-scale deployment or require access to model internals (white-box weights or grey-box log probabilities). There's a need for both low-cost and strictly black-box operation that only observes output tokens.

Method: Proposes Black-Box Border Input Tracking (B3IT) scheme based on border inputs - specific inputs where there exists more than one output top token. Statistical analysis shows these inputs enable powerful change detection tests based on the model's Jacobian and Fisher information of output distribution, especially in low-temperature regimes.

Result: Border inputs are easily found for non-reasoning tested endpoints. B3IT achieves performance on par with the best available grey-box approaches while reducing costs by 30x compared to existing methods, operating in a strict black-box setting.

Conclusion: B3IT provides an effective, low-cost solution for black-box change detection in LLMs by leveraging border inputs, enabling practical large-scale monitoring without access to model internals.

Abstract: Remote change detection in LLMs is a difficult problem. Existing methods are either too expensive for deployment at scale, or require initial white-box access to model weights or grey-box access to log probabilities. We aim to achieve both low cost and strict black-box operation, observing only output tokens.
  Our approach hinges on specific inputs we call Border Inputs, for which there exists more than one output top token. From a statistical perspective, optimal change detection depends on the model's Jacobian and the Fisher information of the output distribution. Analyzing these quantities in low-temperature regimes shows that border inputs enable powerful change detection tests.
  Building on this insight, we propose the Black-Box Border Input Tracking (B3IT) scheme. Extensive in-vivo and in-vitro experiments show that border inputs are easily found for non-reasoning tested endpoints, and achieve performance on par with the best available grey-box approaches. B3IT reduces costs by $30\times$ compared to existing methods, while operating in a strict black-box setting.

Abstract: Identifying where quantum models may offer practical benefits in near term quantum machine learning (QML) requires moving beyond isolated algorithmic proposals toward systematic and empirical exploration across models, datasets, and hardware constraints. We introduce MerLin, an open source framework designed as a discovery engine for photonic and hybrid quantum machine learning. MerLin integrates optimized strong simulation of linear optical circuits into standard PyTorch and scikit learn workflows, enabling end to end differentiable training of quantum layers. MerLin is designed around systematic benchmarking and reproducibility. As an initial contribution, we reproduce eighteen state of the art photonic and hybrid QML works spanning kernel methods, reservoir computing, convolutional and recurrent architectures, generative models, and modern training paradigms. These reproductions are released as reusable, modular experiments that can be directly extended and adapted, establishing a shared experimental baseline consistent with empirical benchmarking methodologies widely adopted in modern artificial intelligence. By embedding photonic quantum models within established machine learning ecosystems, MerLin allows practitioners to leverage existing tooling for ablation studies, cross modality comparisons, and hybrid classical quantum workflows. The framework already implements hardware aware features, allowing tests on available quantum hardware while enabling exploration beyond its current capabilities, positioning MerLin as a future proof co design tool linking algorithms, benchmarks, and hardware.

*David A. Barajas-Solano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINNs for IBVPs analyzed from statistical learning perspective, treating physics penalty as infinite indirect data source rather than regularization, showing PINNs as singular learning problem with implications for uncertainty quantification and extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a statistical learning theory foundation for understanding physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) when solving initial and boundary value problems, moving beyond the conventional view of physics constraints as regularization.

Method: Reformulate PINN parameter estimation as statistical learning problem with hard initial/boundary constraints. Treat physics penalty as fitting PINN residual distribution to true data-generating distribution via KL divergence minimization. Apply singular learning theory tools (Local Learning Coefficient) to analyze PINN parameter estimates for heat equation IBVP.

Result: Physics-informed learning with PINNs is identified as a singular learning problem. The physics penalty is better understood as an infinite source of indirect data rather than regularization. Analysis provides framework for understanding PINN parameter estimation via stochastic optimization.

Conclusion: Statistical learning perspective offers new insights into PINNs: physics constraints as infinite data source, singular learning nature, with implications for predictive uncertainty quantification and extrapolation capacity analysis.

Abstract: We study the training and performance of physics-informed learning for initial and boundary value problems (IBVP) with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) from a statistical learning perspective. Specifically, we restrict ourselves to parameterizations with hard initial and boundary condition constraints and reformulate the problem of estimating PINN parameters as a statistical learning problem. From this perspective, the physics penalty on the IBVP residuals can be better understood not as a regularizing term bus as an infinite source of indirect data, and the learning process as fitting the PINN distribution of residuals $p(y \mid x, t, w) q(x, t) $ to the true data-generating distribution $δ(0) q(x, t)$ by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true and PINN distributions. Furthermore, this analysis show that physics-informed learning with PINNs is a singular learning problem, and we employ singular learning theory tools, namely the so-called Local Learning Coefficient (Lau et al., 2025) to analyze the estimates of PINN parameters obtained via stochastic optimization for a heat equation IBVP. Finally, we discuss implications of this analysis on the quantification of predictive uncertainty of PINNs and the extrapolation capacity of PINNs.

TL;DR: MKNA is a language-driven AI agent that translates natural language scientific queries into automated materials discovery workflows, successfully identifying high-Debye-temperature ceramics including novel Be-C-rich compounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional materials discovery relies heavily on expert intuition and computationally expensive simulations, creating bottlenecks in finding high-performance materials for energy, electronics, and aerospace applications.

Method: Materials Knowledge Navigation Agent (MKNA) - a language-driven system that translates natural-language scientific intent into executable actions for database retrieval, property prediction, structure generation, and stability evaluation. It autonomously extracts quantitative thresholds and chemically meaningful design motifs from literature and database evidence.

Result: MKNA successfully identified a literature-supported screening criterion (Theta_D > 800 K), rediscovered canonical ultra-stiff materials (diamond, SiC, SiN, BeO), and proposed thermodynamically stable, previously unreported Be-C-rich compounds in the sparsely explored 1500-1700 K regime.

Conclusion: MKNA demonstrates autonomous, language-guided materials exploration that not only finds stable candidates but also reconstructs interpretable design heuristics, establishing a generalizable platform for accelerating materials discovery.

Abstract: Accelerating the discovery of high-performance materials remains a central challenge across energy, electronics, and aerospace technologies, where traditional workflows depend heavily on expert intuition and computationally expensive simulations. Here we introduce the Materials Knowledge Navigation Agent (MKNA), a language-driven system that translates natural-language scientific intent into executable actions for database retrieval, property prediction, structure generation, and stability evaluation. Beyond automating tool invocation, MKNA autonomously extracts quantitative thresholds and chemically meaningful design motifs from literature and database evidence, enabling data-grounded hypothesis formation. Applied to the search for high-Debye-temperature ceramics, the agent identifies a literature-supported screening criterion (Theta_D > 800 K), rediscovers canonical ultra-stiff materials such as diamond, SiC, SiN, and BeO, and proposes thermodynamically stable, previously unreported Be-C-rich compounds that populate the sparsely explored 1500-1700 K regime. These results demonstrate that MKNA not only finds stable candidates but also reconstructs interpretable design heuristics, establishing a generalizable platform for autonomous, language-guided materials exploration.

### [221] [The Offline-Frontier Shift: Diagnosing Distributional Limits in Generative Multi-Objective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11126)
*Stephanie Holly,Alexandru-Ciprian Zăvoianu,Siegfried Silber,Sepp Hochreiter,Werner Zellinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generative methods for offline multi-objective optimization underperform evolutionary alternatives on metrics like generational distance due to offline-frontier shift, which limits their ability to sample out-of-distribution in objective space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why generative methods (like diffusion models) perform well on hypervolume but poorly on other MOO metrics, and to identify the fundamental limitations in offline MOO that cause these performance gaps.

Method: The paper analyzes generative vs. evolutionary methods in offline MOO, identifies the "offline-frontier shift" phenomenon, and uses integral probability metrics to measure out-of-distribution sampling capability in objective space.

Result: Generative methods systematically underperform evolutionary alternatives on metrics like generational distance, remain conservatively close to offline objective distribution, and fail to overcome the offline-frontier shift limitation.

Conclusion: Offline MOO is fundamentally limited by distribution shift (offline-frontier shift), and generative methods' failure to sample out-of-distribution in objective space explains their poor performance on certain MOO metrics.

Abstract: Offline multi-objective optimization (MOO) aims to recover Pareto-optimal designs given a finite, static dataset. Recent generative approaches, including diffusion models, show strong performance under hypervolume, yet their behavior under other established MOO metrics is less understood. We show that generative methods systematically underperform evolutionary alternatives with respect to other metrics, such as generational distance. We relate this failure mode to the offline-frontier shift, i.e., the displacement of the offline dataset from the Pareto front, which acts as a fundamental limitation in offline MOO. We argue that overcoming this limitation requires out-of-distribution sampling in objective space (via an integral probability metric) and empirically observe that generative methods remain conservatively close to the offline objective distribution. Our results position offline MOO as a distribution-shift--limited problem and provide a diagnostic lens for understanding when and why generative optimization methods fail.

### [222] [Asymmetric Prompt Weighting for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11128)
*Reinhard Heckel,Mahdi Soltanolkotabi,Christos Thramboulidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes asymmetric prompt weighting for RL in LLMs, favoring low-success prompts to accelerate training, especially in from-scratch scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, RLOO) focus on ambiguous prompts and downgrade very easy/hard prompts, but this may not be optimal for from-scratch training where low-success prompts contain valuable learning signals.

Method: Proposes asymmetric prompt weighting that assigns higher weights to prompts with low or zero empirical success probability, with theoretical analysis to characterize optimal weights that minimize time to reach target accuracy under fixed update budget.

Result: Asymmetric weighting particularly benefits from-scratch RL (like R1-Zero) where training covers wide accuracy range, less beneficial for post-SFT RL where model already starts at high accuracy. Optimal weights become asymmetric in low-success regimes where informative responses are rare.

Conclusion: Asymmetric prompt weighting accelerates effective-time convergence in low-success regimes by upweighting low-success prompts, making it particularly valuable for from-scratch RL training where response cost dominates and informative responses are rare.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has driven recent advances in LLM post-training, in particular for reasoning. Policy optimization algorithms generate a number of responses for a given prompt and then effectively weight the corresponding gradients depending on the rewards. The most popular algorithms including GRPO, DAPO, and RLOO focus on ambiguous prompts, i.e., prompts with intermediate success probability, while downgrading gradients with very easy and very hard prompts. In this paper, we consider asymmetric prompt weightings that assign higher weights to prompts with low, or even zero, empirical success probability. We find that asymmetric weighting particularly benefits from-scratch RL (as in R1-Zero), where training traverses a wide accuracy range, and less so in post-SFT RL where the model already starts at high accuracy. We also provide theory that characterizes prompt weights which minimize the time needed to raise success probability from an initial level to a target accuracy under a fixed update budget. In low-success regimes, where informative responses are rare and response cost dominates, these optimal weights become asymmetric, upweighting low success probabilities and thereby accelerating effective-time convergence.

TL;DR: Training-free token-level early stopping for diffusion language models that identifies convergence independently at each position, reducing computational cost while preserving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models are computationally inefficient because many tokens reach stability long before the final denoising step, wasting computation on already-converged tokens.

Method: Introduces a training-free, token-level early stopping approach that uses lightweight signals from model predictions and local context to dynamically determine when individual tokens can be finalized, enabling adaptive per-token freezing without task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art efficiency gains across diverse benchmarks (mathematical reasoning, general QA, scientific understanding) while preserving generation quality, substantially reducing total diffusion steps required.

Conclusion: Token-level early stopping provides an effective way to improve computational efficiency of diffusion language models without compromising output quality, offering a practical solution to the inefficiency problem in iterative text generation.

Abstract: Diffusion language models generate text through iterative refinement, a process that is often computationally inefficient because many tokens reach stability long before the final denoising step. We introduce a training-free, token-level early stopping approach that identifies convergence independently at each position. Our method leverages lightweight signals derived from the model's predictions and local context to dynamically determine when individual tokens can be finalized. This yields adaptive per-token freezing without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the total number of diffusion steps required. Across diverse benchmarks, spanning mathematical reasoning, general question answering, and scientific understanding, our approach achieves state-of-the-art efficiency gains while preserving generation quality.

Motivation: Tabular foundation models have recently surpassed gradient-boosted trees in predictive benchmarks, showing the value of in-context learning for tabular data. The authors aim to create an even better model that can handle larger datasets more efficiently while maintaining superior performance.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) novel synthetic data generation engine for high pretraining diversity, (2) architectural improvements including a new scalable softmax in attention for better generalization to larger datasets, and (3) optimized pretraining protocols replacing AdamW with the Muon optimizer.

Conclusion: TabICLv2 establishes a new state-of-the-art for tabular foundation models, demonstrating that improved synthetic data generation, architectural innovations, and optimized training protocols can create models that outperform heavily tuned and ensembled alternatives while being more computationally efficient.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models, such as TabPFNv2 and TabICL, have recently dethroned gradient-boosted trees at the top of predictive benchmarks, demonstrating the value of in-context learning for tabular data. We introduce TabICLv2, a new state-of-the-art foundation model for regression and classification built on three pillars: (1) a novel synthetic data generation engine designed for high pretraining diversity; (2) various architectural innovations, including a new scalable softmax in attention improving generalization to larger datasets without prohibitive long-sequence pretraining; and (3) optimized pretraining protocols, notably replacing AdamW with the Muon optimizer. On the TabArena and TALENT benchmarks, TabICLv2 without any tuning surpasses the performance of the current state of the art, RealTabPFN-2.5 (hyperparameter-tuned, ensembled, and fine-tuned on real data). With only moderate pretraining compute, TabICLv2 generalizes effectively to million-scale datasets under 50GB GPU memory while being markedly faster than RealTabPFN-2.5. We provide extensive ablation studies to quantify these contributions and commit to open research by first releasing inference code and model weights at https://github.com/soda-inria/tabicl, with synthetic data engine and pretraining code to follow.

Conclusion: The models demonstrate effectiveness in production environments where retrieval quality and efficiency are critical at scale, validating their practical utility for real-world, large-scale search scenarios.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce pplx-embed, a family of multilingual embedding models that employ multi-stage contrastive learning on a diffusion-pretrained language model backbone for web-scale retrieval. By leveraging bidirectional attention through diffusion-based pretraining, our models capture comprehensive bidirectional context within passages, enabling the use of mean pooling and a late chunking strategy to better preserve global context across long documents. We release two model types: pplx-embed-v1 for standard retrieval, and pplx-embed-context-v1 for contextualized embeddings that incorporate global document context into passage representations. pplx-embed-v1 achieves competitive performance on the MTEB(Multilingual, v2), MTEB(Code), MIRACL, BERGEN, and ToolRet retrieval benchmarks, while pplx-embed-context-v1 sets new records on the ConTEB benchmark. Beyond public benchmarks, pplx-embed-v1 demonstrates strong performance on our internal evaluation suite, which focuses on real-world, large-scale search scenarios over tens of millions of documents.

*Jijia Tian,Junting Chen,Pooi-Yuen Kam*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A predictive UAV downlink framework splits semantic content into structure and texture streams with differentiated error protection, achieving 5.6 dB PSNR gain over single-stream baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV downlink transmission for time-sensitive visual applications faces bandwidth scarcity and dynamic channel impairments. Conventional DeepJSCC methods transmit coupled feature streams, causing global reconstruction failure when specific time slots experience deep fading due to rapid A2G link fluctuations.

Method: Decouples semantic content into deterministic structure and stochastic texture components. Develops a predictive transmission framework with split-stream variational codec and channel-aware scheduler to prioritize structural layout delivery over reliable transmission slots.

Result: Achieves 5.6 dB gain in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) over single-stream baselines. Maintains structural fidelity under significant prediction mismatch of future channel quality.

Conclusion: Differentiated error protection strategies aligned with channel reliability through content decoupling significantly improves UAV visual transmission performance in dynamic channel conditions.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) downlink transmission facilitates critical time-sensitive visual applications but is fundamentally constrained by bandwidth scarcity and dynamic channel impairments. The rapid fluctuation of the air-to-ground (A2G) link creates a regime where reliable transmission slots are intermittent and future channel quality can only be predicted with uncertainty. Conventional deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) methods transmit coupled feature streams, causing global reconstruction failure when specific time slots experience deep fading. Decoupling semantic content into a deterministic structure component and a stochastic texture component enables differentiated error protection strategies aligned with channel reliability. A predictive transmission framework is developed that utilizes a split-stream variational codec and a channel-aware scheduler to prioritize the delivery of structural layout over reliable slots. Experimental evaluations indicate that this approach achieves a 5.6 dB gain in peak signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio over single-stream baselines and maintains structural fidelity under significant prediction mismatch.

### [227] [Predictive-State Communication: Innovation Coding and Reconciliation under Delay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10542)
*Ozgur Ercetin,Mohaned Chraiti*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces Predictive-State Communication (PSC), a new communication paradigm where endpoints with strong predictors use the channel primarily for conveying innovations/corrections rather than literal symbol transport, replacing entropy-rate with cross-entropy accounting and creating bounded perception-capacity bands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Shannon theory assumes literal symbol transport, but modern endpoints (like large language models) possess strong predictive capabilities. This creates an opportunity to shift from transporting symbols to conveying only the innovations needed to reconcile predictive states between transmitter and receiver.

Method: Proposes Predictive-State Communication (PSC) where transmitter and receiver maintain explicit shared predictive states. The physical channel conveys innovations - corrective information to reconcile receiver's provisional trajectory with transmitter's realized trajectory. Introduces cross-entropy accounting under model mismatch instead of entropy-rate accounting.

Result: PSC introduces feasibility constraints that depend jointly on capacity, delay, and perceptual continuity requirements, resulting in a bounded perception-capacity band rather than a one-sided threshold. The paper outlines protocol/architectural implications including state identifiers, anchors, bounded rollback, and patch-based updates.

Conclusion: When endpoints have strong predictors, communication can shift from literal symbol transport to innovation-based predictive-state communication, fundamentally changing the operational regime from capacity thresholds to bounded perception-capacity bands with new architectural requirements.

Abstract: Shannon theory models communication as the reliable transfer of symbol sequences, with performance governed by capacity and rate-distortion limits. When both endpoints possess strong predictors -- as in modern large language models and related generative priors -- literal symbol transport is no longer the only operational regime. We propose predictive-state communication (PSC), in which the transmitter and receiver maintain an explicit shared predictive state, and the physical channel is used primarily to convey innovations, i.e., corrective information that reconciles the receiver's provisional trajectory with the transmitter's realized trajectory. This viewpoint replaces entropy-rate accounting by cross-entropy accounting under model mismatch, and it introduces feasibility constraints that depend jointly on capacity, delay, and perceptual continuity requirements; the resulting operating set is typically a bounded perception-capacity band rather than a one-sided threshold. We outline the protocol and architectural implications (state identifiers, anchors, bounded rollback, and patch-based updates) and provide a stylized illustrative example to visualize the induced feasibility region and its dependence on predictive quality.

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework using PPO to jointly optimize TN power and antenna tilt for protecting NTN links in FR3 bands, reducing interference by up to 8 dB while maintaining terrestrial network performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Terrestrial networks (TN) and non-terrestrial networks (NTN) in FR3 upper mid-band face severe interference issues where dense TN deployments degrade NTN downlink performance. Existing solutions require accurate CSI and static coordination, making them unsuitable for dynamic NTN scenarios.

Method: Developed an optimization framework that jointly controls TN downlink power, uplink power, and antenna downtilt to protect NTN links. Used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning to address the non-convex coupling between TN and NTN parameters, creating adaptive power and tilt control strategies.

Result: Simulation results show up to 8 dB reduction in median interference-to-noise ratio (INR) while maintaining over 87% TN basestation activity, outperforming conventional baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed PPO-based reinforcement learning strategy effectively enables FR3 coexistence by adaptively managing interference between terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks without requiring static coordination or accurate CSI.

Abstract: The coexistence of terrestrial networks (TN) and non-terrestrial networks (NTN) in the frequency range 3 (FR3) upper mid-band presents considerable interference concerns, as dense TN deployments can severely degrade NTN downlink performance. Existing studies rely on interference-nulling beamforming, precoding, or exclusion zones that require accurate channel state information (CSI) and static coordination, making them unsuitable for dynamic NTN scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we develop an optimization framework that jointly controls TN downlink power, uplink power, and antenna downtilt to protect NTN links while preserving terrestrial performance. The resultant non-convex coupling between TN and NTN parameters is addressed by a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning method that develops adaptive power and tilt control strategies. Simulation results demonstrate a reduction up to 8 dB in the median interference-to-noise ratio (INR) while maintaining over 87% TN basestation activity, outperforming conventional baseline methods and validating the feasibility of the proposed strategy for FR3 coexistence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DIA (Degree of Information Abstraction), a metric to quantify how well representations compress data while preserving task-relevant semantics, and demonstrates its effectiveness in LLM-guided video transmission with 99.75% volume reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological systems like the human brain achieve high energy efficiency through hierarchical information abstraction, while AI and communication systems waste energy transmitting low-level data without proper abstraction. There's a lack of formal computational theory for information abstraction.

Method: Developed DIA (Degree of Information Abstraction) as a general metric with tractable information-theoretic formulation. Created a DIA-based information abstraction framework and applied it to LLM-guided video transmission as a case study.

Result: In the LLM-guided video transmission task, abstraction-aware encoding achieved 99.75% reduction in transmission volume while maintaining semantic fidelity. The framework shows promise for energy-efficient intelligent systems.

Conclusion: DIA provides a principled tool for balancing energy and information in intelligent systems, opening new directions in neural network design, neuromorphic computing, semantic communication, and joint sensing-communication architectures.

Abstract: Biological systems, particularly the human brain, achieve remarkable energy efficiency by abstracting information across multiple hierarchical levels. In contrast, modern artificial intelligence and communication systems often consume significant energy overheads in transmitting low-level data, with limited emphasis on abstraction. Despite its implicit importance, a formal and computational theory of information abstraction remains absent. In this work, we introduce the Degree of Information Abstraction (DIA), a general metric that quantifies how well a representation compresses input data while preserving task-relevant semantics. We derive a tractable information-theoretic formulation of DIA and propose a DIA-based information abstraction framework. As a case study, we apply DIA to a large language model (LLM)-guided video transmission task, where abstraction-aware encoding significantly reduces transmission volume by $99.75\%$, while maintaining semantic fidelity. Our results suggest that DIA offers a principled tool for rebalancing energy and information in intelligent systems and opens new directions in neural network design, neuromorphic computing, semantic communication, and joint sensing-communication architectures.

TL;DR: E-FAS enables new wireless communication by using intelligent surfaces as multi-functional EM interfaces that route surface waves and emit space waves, with analytical models showing preserved diversity order and improved coding gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide analytical performance characterization of E-FAS-enabled wireless links, which represent a new architectural paradigm where intelligent surfaces are repurposed from passive reflectors into multi-functional EM interfaces that enable new forms of signal propagation.

Method: Developed a physics-consistent end-to-end channel model coupling surface-impedance wave formulation with small-scale fading; derived closed-form expressions for outage probability and ergodic capacity for single-user cases; derived SINR distribution and tractable approximations for ergodic sum-rate for multiuser cases with ZF precoding.

Result: E-FAS preserves the diversity order dictated by small-scale fading while improving coding gain enabled by cylindrical surface-wave propagation; provides enhanced average power capturing surface-wave attenuation and junction losses; quantifies E-FAS gain over purely space-wave propagation.

Conclusion: E-FAS represents a promising new wireless architectural paradigm that enables new signal propagation modes while maintaining diversity benefits and providing coding gain improvements through surface-wave propagation.

Abstract: Enormous fluid antenna systems (E-FAS), the system concept that utilizes position reconfigurability in the large scale, have emerged as a new architectural paradigm where intelligent surfaces are repurposed from passive smart reflectors into multi-functional electromagnetic (EM) interfaces that can route guided surface waves over walls, ceilings, and building facades, as well as emit space waves to target receivers. This expanded functionality introduces a new mode of signal propagation, enabling new forms of wireless communication. In this paper, we provide an analytical performance characterization of an E-FAS-enabled wireless link. We first develop a physics-consistent end-to-end channel model that couples a surface-impedance wave formulation with small-scale fading on both the base station (BS)-surface and launcher-user segments. We illustrate that the resulting effective BS-user channel remains circularly symmetric complex Gaussian, with an enhanced average power that explicitly captures surface-wave attenuation and junction losses. For single-user cases with linear precoding, we derive the outage probability and ergodic capacity in closed forms, together with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotics that quantify the gain of E-FAS over purely space-wave propagation. For the multiuser case with zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we derive the distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and obtain tractable approximations for the ergodic sum-rate, explicitly revealing how the E-FAS macro-gain interacts with the BS spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). In summary, our analysis shows that E-FAS preserves the diversity order dictated by small-scale fading while improving the coding gain enabled by cylindrical surface-wave propagation.

*Caroline Wang,Daniel Kasenberg,Kim Stachenfeld,Pablo Samuel Castro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaEvolve discovers interpretable models of human vs LLM strategic behavior in games, revealing LLMs can exhibit deeper strategic thinking than humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in social/strategic scenarios, we need to understand how their behavior differs from humans. Existing behavioral game theory models don't fully capture idiosyncratic human behavior or black-box LLM behavior.

Method: Use AlphaEvolve (program discovery tool) to directly discover interpretable models of human and LLM behavior from data, enabling open-ended discovery of structural factors driving behavior. Analyze iterated rock-paper-scissors game.

Result: Frontier LLMs can be capable of deeper strategic behavior than humans in iterated rock-paper-scissors. The approach provides interpretable models that reveal structural differences in strategic thinking.

Conclusion: The method provides a foundation for understanding structural differences driving human vs LLM behavior in strategic interactions, with implications for deploying LLMs in social scenarios.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in social and strategic scenarios, it becomes critical to understand where and why their behavior diverges from that of humans. While behavioral game theory (BGT) provides a framework for analyzing behavior, existing models do not fully capture the idiosyncratic behavior of humans or black-box, non-human agents like LLMs. We employ AlphaEvolve, a cutting-edge program discovery tool, to directly discover interpretable models of human and LLM behavior from data, thereby enabling open-ended discovery of structural factors driving human and LLM behavior. Our analysis on iterated rock-paper-scissors reveals that frontier LLMs can be capable of deeper strategic behavior than humans. These results provide a foundation for understanding structural differences driving differences in human and LLM behavior in strategic interactions.

### [233] [LiveMedBench: A Contamination-Free Medical Benchmark for LLMs with Automated Rubric Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10367)
*Zhiling Yan,Dingjie Song,Zhe Fang,Yisheng Ji,Xiang Li,Quanzheng Li,Lichao Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LiveMedBench is a continuously updated, contamination-free medical benchmark using real-world clinical cases with automated rubric-based evaluation to address data contamination and temporal misalignment issues in LLM evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical benchmarks suffer from data contamination (test data leaking into training) and temporal misalignment (not capturing rapid medical knowledge evolution), while current evaluation metrics (ROUGE or LLM-as-a-Judge) are inadequate for verifying clinical correctness.

Method: 1) LiveMedBench: weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities with strict temporal separation from training data. 2) Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework: filters noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based principles. 3) Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework: decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria for objective assessment.

Result: Benchmark includes 2,756 real-world cases across 38 specialties and multiple languages with 16,702 unique evaluation criteria. Evaluation of 38 LLMs shows best model achieves only 39.2% performance, and 84% of models degrade on post-cutoff cases, confirming data contamination risks. Error analysis reveals contextual application (35-48% of failures) is the dominant bottleneck, not factual knowledge.

Conclusion: LiveMedBench provides a robust, contamination-free benchmark that reveals significant limitations in current LLMs for clinical applications, particularly in contextual application of medical knowledge to patient-specific constraints, highlighting the need for more rigorous evaluation frameworks in medical AI.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical settings demands rigorous and reliable evaluation. However, existing medical benchmarks remain static, suffering from two critical limitations: (1) data contamination, where test sets inadvertently leak into training corpora, leading to inflated performance estimates; and (2) temporal misalignment, failing to capture the rapid evolution of medical knowledge. Furthermore, current evaluation metrics for open-ended clinical reasoning often rely on either shallow lexical overlap (e.g., ROUGE) or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, both inadequate for verifying clinical correctness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LiveMedBench, a continuously updated, contamination-free, and rubric-based benchmark that weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities, ensuring strict temporal separation from model training data. We propose a Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework that filters raw data noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based medical principles. For evaluation, we develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria, achieving substantially stronger alignment with expert physicians than LLM-as-a-Judge. To date, LiveMedBench comprises 2,756 real-world cases spanning 38 medical specialties and multiple languages, paired with 16,702 unique evaluation criteria. Extensive evaluation of 38 LLMs reveals that even the best-performing model achieves only 39.2%, and 84% of models exhibit performance degradation on post-cutoff cases, confirming pervasive data contamination risks. Error analysis further identifies contextual application-not factual knowledge-as the dominant bottleneck, with 35-48% of failures stemming from the inability to tailor medical knowledge to patient-specific constraints.

### [234] [Found-RL: foundation model-enhanced reinforcement learning for autonomous driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10458)
*Yansong Qu,Zihao Sheng,Zilin Huang,Jiancong Chen,Yuhao Luo,Tianyi Wang,Yiheng Feng,Samuel Labi,Sikai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Found-RL is a platform that efficiently integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Reinforcement Learning for autonomous driving, using asynchronous batch inference to overcome VLM latency issues and novel supervision mechanisms to distill VLM knowledge into lightweight RL policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL is dominant for autonomous driving but suffers from sample inefficiency and lack of semantic interpretability. VLMs offer rich context-aware knowledge but their high inference latency prevents integration into high-frequency RL training loops.

Method: 1) Asynchronous batch inference framework decouples heavy VLM reasoning from simulation loop; 2) Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to distill VLM action suggestions; 3) High-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping with Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment to address CLIP's dynamic blindness.

Result: Lightweight RL model achieves near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (~500 FPS). The platform provides end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration.

Conclusion: Found-RL successfully bridges the gap between RL and foundation models for autonomous driving, enabling efficient knowledge distillation from VLMs to lightweight RL policies while maintaining real-time performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving (AD). However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS). Code, data, and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/ys-qu/found-rl.

### [235] [MERIT Feedback Elicits Better Bargaining in LLM Negotiators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10467)
*Jihwan Oh,Murad Aghazada,Yooju Shin,Se-Young Yun,Taehyeon Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgoraBench: A new benchmark for evaluating LLMs in complex bargaining scenarios with utility-based metrics and human preference alignment


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with bargaining due to limited strategic depth and difficulty adapting to complex human factors, and existing benchmarks fail to capture these limitations

Method: Created AgoraBench with nine challenging bargaining settings, developed utility-based metrics (agent utility, negotiation power, acquisition ratio), and built a human preference dataset with learning pipeline for both prompting and finetuning

Result: Baseline LLM strategies often diverge from human preferences, while the proposed mechanism substantially improves negotiation performance with deeper strategic behavior and stronger opponent awareness

Conclusion: The utility feedback centric framework with human-aligned metrics and training pipeline significantly enhances LLMs' bargaining capabilities, addressing current limitations in strategic negotiation

Abstract: Bargaining is often regarded as a logical arena rather than an art or a matter of intuition, yet Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to navigate it due to limited strategic depth and difficulty adapting to complex human factors. Current benchmarks rarely capture this limitation. To bridge this gap, we present an utility feedback centric framework. Our contributions are: (i) AgoraBench, a new benchmark spanning nine challenging settings (e.g., deception, monopoly) that supports diverse strategy modeling; (ii) human-aligned, economically grounded metrics derived from utility theory. This is operationalized via agent utility, negotiation power, and acquisition ratio that implicitly measure how well the negotiation aligns with human preference and (iii) a human preference grounded dataset with learning pipeline that strengthens LLMs' bargaining ability through both prompting and finetuning. Empirical results indicate that baseline LLM strategies often diverge from human preferences, while our mechanism substantially improves negotiation performance, yielding deeper strategic behavior and stronger opponent awareness.

*Zhenhe Cui,Huaxiang Xia,Hangjun Shen,Kailun Luo,Yong He,Wei Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can generate QNP abstractions for generalized planning when guided by automated debugging methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can serve as Qualitative Numerical Planning (QNP) abstraction generators for generalized planning problems and develop methods to fix abstraction errors automatically.

Method: Proposed a prompt protocol where LLMs are given GP domains and training tasks to generate abstract features and QNP problems, combined with automated debugging to detect and fix abstraction errors.

Result: Experiments show that with proper guidance from automated debugging, some LLMs can generate useful QNP abstractions for generalized planning.

Conclusion: LLMs can function as QNP abstraction generators when supported by automated debugging techniques, enabling them to create useful abstractions for generalized planning problems.

Abstract: Qualitative Numerical Planning (QNP) serves as an important abstraction model for generalized planning (GP), which aims to compute general plans that solve multiple instances at once. Recent works show that large language models (LLMs) can function as generalized planners. This work investigates whether LLMs can serve as QNP abstraction generators for GP problems and how to fix abstractions via automated debugging. We propose a prompt protocol: input a GP domain and training tasks to LLMs, prompting them to generate abstract features and further abstract the initial state, action set, and goal into QNP problems. An automated debugging method is designed to detect abstraction errors, guiding LLMs to fix abstractions. Experiments demonstrate that under properly guided by automated debugging, some LLMs can generate useful QNP abstractions.

### [237] [Flow of Spans: Generalizing Language Models to Dynamic Span-Vocabulary via GFlowNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10583)
*Bo Xue,Yunchong Song,Fanghao Shao,Xuekai Zhu,Lin Chen,Luoyi Fu,Xinbing Wang,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FoSS introduces a GFlowNets framework for span generation that creates dynamic span vocabularies from retrieved text, enabling exploration of DAG-structured state spaces for more diverse and higher-quality text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard autoregressive models are limited by fixed vocabularies and tree-structured state spaces, while recent dynamic vocabulary approaches overlook the DAG nature of span composition, restricting exploration and introducing bias.

Method: Flow of SpanS (FoSS) uses GFlowNets with dynamic span vocabularies created by flexibly segmenting retrieved text, ensuring DAG-structured state spaces that allow exploration of diverse compositional paths.

Result: FoSS improves MAUVE scores by up to 12.5% over Transformer on text generation and achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FoSS demonstrates that GFlowNets with dynamic span vocabularies and DAG-structured state spaces enable more diverse, high-quality text generation and better generalization, with scaling benefits from larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora.

Abstract: Standard autoregressive language models generate text token-by-token from a fixed vocabulary, inducing a tree-structured state space when viewing token sampling as an action, which limits flexibility and expressiveness. Recent work introduces dynamic vocabulary by sampling retrieved text spans but overlooks that the same sentence can be composed of spans of varying lengths, lacking explicit modeling of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) state space. This leads to restricted exploration of compositional paths and is biased toward the chosen path. Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful for efficient exploring and generalizing over state spaces, particularly those with a DAG structure. However, prior GFlowNets-based language models operate at the token level and remain confined to tree-structured spaces, limiting their potential. In this work, we propose Flow of SpanS (FOSS), a principled GFlowNets framework for span generation. FoSS constructs a dynamic span vocabulary by segmenting the retrieved text flexibly, ensuring a DAG-structured state space, which allows GFlowNets to explore diverse compositional paths and improve generalization. With specialized reward models, FoSS generates diverse, high-quality text. Empirically, FoSS improves MAUVE scores by up to 12.5% over Transformer on text generation and achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Scaling experiments further demonstrate FoSS benefits from larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora, retaining its advantage over strong baselines.

### [238] [Neuro-symbolic Action Masking for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10598)
*Shuai Han,Mehdi Dastani,Shihan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NSAM is a neuro-symbolic framework that automatically learns symbolic models from high-dimensional states to mask infeasible actions during DRL training, improving sample efficiency and reducing constraint violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRL approaches require manually specified action masking and assume consistent symbolic representations, which limits their practicality. There's a need for automatic learning of symbolic models that align with domain constraints in high-dimensional states.

Method: NSAM learns symbolic models from high-dimensional states in a minimally supervised manner during DRL training. It uses these learned symbolic models to create action masks that filter out infeasible actions, enabling end-to-end integration of symbolic reasoning with deep policy optimization.

Result: NSAM significantly improves sample efficiency of DRL agents while substantially reducing constraint violations across multiple domains with constraints.

Conclusion: The framework enables mutual reinforcement between symbolic grounding and policy learning, providing an effective approach for constraint-aware DRL without requiring manual symbolic specification.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) may explore infeasible actions during training and execution. Existing approaches assume a symbol grounding function that maps high-dimensional states to consistent symbolic representations and a manually specified action masking techniques to constrain actions. In this paper, we propose Neuro-symbolic Action Masking (NSAM), a novel framework that automatically learn symbolic models, which are consistent with given domain constraints of high-dimensional states, in a minimally supervised manner during the DRL process. Based on the learned symbolic model of states, NSAM learns action masks that rules out infeasible actions. NSAM enables end-to-end integration of symbolic reasoning and deep policy optimization, where improvements in symbolic grounding and policy learning mutually reinforce each other. We evaluate NSAM on multiple domains with constraints, and experimental results demonstrate that NSAM significantly improves sample efficiency of DRL agent while substantially reducing constraint violations.

### [239] [To Think or Not To Think, That is The Question for Large Reasoning Models in Theory of Mind Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10625)
*Nanxu Gong,Haotian Li,Sixun Dong,Jianxun Lian,Yanjie Fu,Xing Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reasoning models don't consistently outperform non-reasoning models on Theory of Mind tasks, revealing limitations in transferring formal reasoning skills to social cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the reasoning capabilities developed in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) for mathematics and coding transfer to socio-cognitive skills like Theory of Mind, which is essential for natural social interaction.

Method: Systematic study of nine advanced LLMs comparing reasoning vs. non-reasoning models on three ToM benchmarks, with fine-grained analysis of reasoning patterns, option matching effects, and intervention approaches (Slow-to-Fast adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match shortcut prevention).

Result: Reasoning models don't consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. Key findings: 1) Slow thinking collapses with longer responses, 2) Moderate/adaptive reasoning helps, 3) Models rely on option matching shortcuts rather than genuine deduction.

Conclusion: Advancements in LRMs for formal reasoning (math, code) don't fully transfer to ToM tasks. Achieving robust Theory of Mind requires developing unique capabilities beyond existing reasoning methods.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) assesses whether models can infer hidden mental states such as beliefs, desires, and intentions, which is essential for natural social interaction. Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction. We also design two intervention approaches: Slow-to-Fast (S2F) adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match (T2M) shortcut prevention to further verify and mitigate the problems. With all results, our study highlights the advancement of LRMs in formal reasoning (e.g., math, code) cannot be fully transferred to ToM, a typical task in social reasoning. We conclude that achieving robust ToM requires developing unique capabilities beyond existing reasoning methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARPO is a new RL method that balances learning across heterogeneous behavioral tasks and samples to develop a unified social behavior foundation model called Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, which outperforms existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches model human behavioral dimensions in isolation, which increases training costs and limits generalization. Recent reasoning RL methods don't explicitly address learning across heterogeneous behavioral data.

Method: Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO) - an RL method that modulates advantages to ensure no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization, balancing learning across heterogeneous tasks and samples.

Result: Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves strongest performance across behavioral tasks with gains up to +16.85% on multitask and +9.37% on held-out settings, producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces. HARPO outperforms recent RL methods across behavioral tasks.

Conclusion: HARPO successfully addresses the gap in learning across heterogeneous behavioral data, enabling development of a superior foundation model for social behavior processing that generalizes better across diverse behavioral settings.

Abstract: To develop socially intelligent AI, existing approaches typically model human behavioral dimensions (e.g., affective, cognitive, or social attributes) in isolation. Although useful, task-specific modeling often increases training costs and limits generalization across behavioral settings. Recent reasoning RL methods facilitate training a single unified model across multiple behavioral tasks, but do not explicitly address learning across different heterogeneous behavioral data. To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces. We also validate HARPO against recent RL methods, where it achieves the most consistently strong performance across behavioral tasks.

*Jie Jiang,Yangru Huang,Zeyu Wang,Changping Wang,Yuling Xiong,Jun Zhang,Huan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: V-STAR addresses probability-reward mismatch in RL-finetuned generative recommendation by combining value-guided decoding with sibling-relative advantage computation to improve exploration and learning signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning generative recommendation models with RL suffers from probability-reward mismatch: conventional decoding has myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, causing insufficient exploration (high-reward items in low-probability branches get pruned) and advantage compression (trajectories sharing prefixes get correlated rewards with low variance).

Method: V-STAR framework with two synergistic components: 1) Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) identifies decisive nodes and selectively deepens high-potential prefixes for better exploration without exhaustive search; 2) Sibling-GRPO exploits tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages, concentrating learning signals on decisive branching decisions.

Result: Extensive experiments on offline and online datasets show V-STAR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior accuracy and candidate-set diversity under strict latency constraints.

Conclusion: V-STAR effectively addresses the probability-reward mismatch in RL-finetuned generative recommendation through a self-evolving loop of value-guided sampling and tree-structured advantage reinforcement, improving both exploration efficiency and learning signal quality.

Abstract: Generative recommendation via autoregressive models has unified retrieval and ranking into a single conditional generation framework. However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions. Extensive experiments on both offline and online datasets demonstrate that V-STAR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior accuracy and candidate-set diversity under strict latency constraints.

TL;DR: Study examines GenAI perceptions in ITEE disciplines, revealing programming support interest and concerns about quality, privacy, and integrity, leading to a framework for responsible integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GenAI adoption in higher education is growing but perceptions are divided, and EU AI Act requires regulatory compliance, creating need for stakeholder-informed integration approaches.

Method: Mixed-method approach surveying 61 staff and 37 students at Faculty of ITEE, University of Oulu to understand GenAI perceptions in specific disciplinary contexts.

Result: Revealed shared and discipline-specific themes: strong interest in programming support, concerns about response quality, privacy, and academic integrity, with disciplinary differences in perceptions.

Conclusion: Proposes high-level requirements and conceptual framework for responsible GenAI integration emphasizing stakeholder engagement, addressing concerns, and ensuring regulatory compliance in higher education.

Abstract: Many staff and students in higher education have adopted generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools in their work and study. GenAI is expected to enhance cognitive systems by enabling personalized learning and streamlining educational services. However, stakeholders perceptions of GenAI in higher education remain divided, shaped by cultural, disciplinary, and institutional contexts. In addition, the EU AI Act requires universities to ensure regulatory compliance when deploying cognitive systems. These developments highlight the need for institutions to engage stakeholders and tailor GenAI integration to their needs while addressing concerns. This study investigates how GenAI is perceived within the disciplines of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE). Using a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 61 staff and 37 students at the Faculty of ITEE, University of Oulu. The results reveal both shared and discipline-specific themes, including strong interest in programming support from GenAI and concerns over response quality, privacy, and academic integrity. Drawing from these insights, the study identifies a set of high-level requirements and proposes a conceptual framework for responsible GenAI integration. Disciplinary-specific requirements reinforce the importance of stakeholder engagement when integrating GenAI into higher education. The high-level requirements and the framework provide practical guidance for universities aiming to harness GenAI while addressing stakeholder concerns and ensuring regulatory compliance.

*Xingyi Zhang,Yulei Ye,Kaifeng Huang,Wenhao Li,Xiangfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ScratchWorld benchmark evaluates multimodal GUI agents on Scratch programming tasks, revealing a reasoning-acting gap where agents have strong planning but poor fine-grained GUI manipulation skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI agents for block-based programming environments like Scratch lack comprehensive evaluation on GUI-based program construction tasks, creating a need for benchmarks that assess both reasoning and visuomotor control capabilities.

Method: Developed ScratchWorld benchmark with 83 tasks across Create, Debug, Extend, and Compute categories based on Use-Modify-Create framework. Uses two interaction modes: primitive mode for fine-grained drag-and-drop manipulation, and composite mode with semantic APIs to separate reasoning from GUI execution. Implements execution-based evaluation through browser runtime tests.

Result: Experiments with state-of-the-art multimodal models and GUI agents show significant reasoning-acting gap - agents demonstrate strong program planning capabilities but struggle with fine-grained GUI manipulation and execution.

Conclusion: ScratchWorld provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal GUI agents in Scratch programming, revealing persistent challenges in fine-grained GUI manipulation despite advances in program reasoning, highlighting the need for improved visuomotor control in AI agents.

Abstract: Block-based programming environments such as Scratch play a central role in low-code education, yet evaluating the capabilities of AI agents to construct programs through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) remains underexplored. We introduce ScratchWorld, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal GUI agents on program-by-construction tasks in Scratch. Grounded in the Use-Modify-Create pedagogical framework, ScratchWorld comprises 83 curated tasks spanning four distinct problem categories: Create, Debug, Extend, and Compute. To rigorously diagnose the source of agent failures, the benchmark employs two complementary interaction modes: primitive mode requires fine-grained drag-and-drop manipulation to directly assess visuomotor control, while composite mode uses high-level semantic APIs to disentangle program reasoning from GUI execution. To ensure reliable assessment, we propose an execution-based evaluation protocol that validates the functional correctness of the constructed Scratch programs through runtime tests within the browser environment. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art multimodal language models and GUI agents reveal a substantial reasoning--acting gap, highlighting persistent challenges in fine-grained GUI manipulation despite strong planning capabilities.

TL;DR: SynergyKGC is an adaptive KGC framework that resolves structural resolution mismatch by using cross-modal synergy experts and density-dependent identity anchoring to handle heterogeneous graph densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGC methods suffer from "structural resolution mismatch" - they fail to reconcile divergent representational demands across varying graph densities, causing structural noise interference in dense clusters and catastrophic representation collapse in sparse regions.

Method: SynergyKGC advances traditional neighbor aggregation to an active Cross-Modal Synergy Expert via relation-aware cross-attention and semantic-intent-driven gating. It couples a density-dependent Identity Anchoring strategy with a Double-tower Coherent Consistency architecture.

Result: Systematic evaluations on two public benchmarks validate the superiority of SynergyKGC in significantly boosting KGC hit rates, providing empirical evidence for resilient information integration in non-homogeneous structured data.

Conclusion: SynergyKGC effectively reconciles topological heterogeneity while ensuring representational stability across training and inference phases, establishing a generalized principle for handling non-homogeneous structured data.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) fundamentally hinges on the coherent fusion of pre-trained entity semantics with heterogeneous topological structures to facilitate robust relational reasoning. However, existing paradigms encounter a critical "structural resolution mismatch," failing to reconcile divergent representational demands across varying graph densities, which precipitates structural noise interference in dense clusters and catastrophic representation collapse in sparse regions. We present SynergyKGC, an adaptive framework that advances traditional neighbor aggregation to an active Cross-Modal Synergy Expert via relation-aware cross-attention and semantic-intent-driven gating. By coupling a density-dependent Identity Anchoring strategy with a Double-tower Coherent Consistency architecture, SynergyKGC effectively reconciles topological heterogeneity while ensuring representational stability across training and inference phases. Systematic evaluations on two public benchmarks validate the superiority of our method in significantly boosting KGC hit rates, providing empirical evidence for a generalized principle of resilient information integration in non-homogeneous structured data.

*Leheng Sheng,Wenchang Ma,Ruixin Hong,Xiang Wang,An Zhang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLCER is a self-evolving reinforcement learning method that rewards chain-of-thought reasoning using automatically generated and evolving rubrics, eliminating the need for human annotation while outperforming outcome-centric approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CoT reward methods face challenges: human labeling is expensive, static reward models can't adapt to evolving CoT distributions, and they're vulnerable to reward hacking. The paper seeks an autonomous approach that requires no human annotation and can evolve gradually.

Method: RLCER (Reinforcement Learning with CoT Supervision via Self-Evolving Rubrics) enhances outcome-centric RLVR by rewarding CoTs with self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics. The system autonomously generates evaluation rubrics and evolves them over time to provide reliable CoT supervision signals.

Result: Self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics provide reliable CoT supervision even without outcome rewards, enabling RLCER to outperform outcome-centric RLVR. When used as in-prompt hints, these self-proposed rubrics further improve inference-time performance.

Conclusion: RLCER demonstrates that autonomous, self-evolving rubrics can effectively supervise CoT reasoning in LLMs, overcoming limitations of human-annotated reward models and offering a scalable approach to improving reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Despite chain-of-thought (CoT) playing crucial roles in LLM reasoning, directly rewarding it is difficult: training a reward model demands heavy human labeling efforts, and static RMs struggle with evolving CoT distributions and reward hacking. These challenges motivate us to seek an autonomous CoT rewarding approach that requires no human annotation efforts and can evolve gradually. Inspired by recent self-evolving training methods, we propose \textbf{RLCER} (\textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{C}oT Supervision via Self-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{R}ubrics), which enhances the outcome-centric RLVR by rewarding CoTs with self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics. We show that self-proposed and self-evolving rubrics provide reliable CoT supervision signals even without outcome rewards, enabling RLCER to outperform outcome-centric RLVR. Moreover, when used as in-prompt hints, these self-proposed rubrics further improve inference-time performance.

### [246] [Can LLMs Cook Jamaican Couscous? A Study of Cultural Novelty in Recipe Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10964)
*F. Carichon,R. Rampa,G. Farnadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs fail to produce culturally representative recipe adaptations, showing no correlation with cultural distance unlike humans, due to weak cultural representation and misunderstanding of creativity/tradition concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for cultural content creation but exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and erasure of culturally specific expressions. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond dominant ones remains a critical challenge.

Method: Study cultural adaptation in LLMs through cooking recipes using the GlobalFusion dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to cultural distance measures. Generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs using the same country pairs, enabling direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation.

Result: LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. Cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, models inflate novelty by misunderstanding creativity and tradition concepts, and they fail to identify adaptation with associated countries and ground it in culturally salient elements like ingredients.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have fundamental limitations for culturally oriented generation, with important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications. The findings highlight that LLMs cannot meaningfully adapt to diverse cultural contexts despite their fluency and generative capacity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications.

TL;DR: CLI-Gym: A pipeline for scalable derivation of environment-intensive tasks by simulating environment histories using Dockerfile analogy, creating 1,655 tasks and fine-tuning LiberCoder model achieving +21.1% improvement on Terminal-Bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic coding requires effective interaction with runtime environments (CLI) for tasks like dependency resolution and system fixes, but there's a lack of scalable methods to obtain environment-intensive tasks to enhance agents' capabilities.

Method: Based on analogy between Dockerfile and agentic tasks, agents simulate and explore environment histories guided by execution feedback. By tracing histories of healthy environments, states are inverted to earlier buggy versions, then tasks are derived by packing buggy states with error messages.

Result: Generated 1,655 environment-intensive tasks (largest collection of its kind). Fine-tuned LiberCoder model achieved +21.1% absolute improvement (to 46.1%) on Terminal-Bench, outperforming various strong baselines.

Conclusion: CLI-Gym presents the first public pipeline for scalable derivation of environment-intensive tasks, enabling significant performance improvements for agentic coding systems through large-scale task generation and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Agentic coding requires agents to effectively interact with runtime environments, e.g., command line interfaces (CLI), so as to complete tasks like resolving dependency issues, fixing system problems, etc. But it remains underexplored how such environment-intensive tasks can be obtained at scale to enhance agents' capabilities. To address this, based on an analogy between the Dockerfile and the agentic task, we propose to employ agents to simulate and explore environment histories, guided by execution feedback. By tracing histories of a healthy environment, its state can be inverted to an earlier one with runtime failures, from which a task can be derived by packing the buggy state and the corresponding error messages. With our method, named CLI-Gym, a total of 1,655 environment-intensive tasks are derived, being the largest collection of its kind. Moreover, with curated successful trajectories, our fine-tuned model, named LiberCoder, achieves substantial absolute improvements of +21.1% (to 46.1%) on Terminal-Bench, outperforming various strong baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first public pipeline for scalable derivation of environment-intensive tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GameDevBench is the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal coding agents on complex game development tasks, featuring 132 tasks requiring significant code and asset manipulation with multimodal understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal coding agents lag behind text-only coding agents due to lack of evaluation testbeds that combine software development complexity with deep multimodal understanding. Game development provides an ideal testbed as it requires navigating large codebases while manipulating multimodal assets like shaders, sprites, and animations.

Method: Created GameDevBench with 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and complex code changes. Introduced two simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms for agents to improve multimodal capability.

Result: GameDevBench tasks are 3x more complex than prior software benchmarks. Current agents struggle, with best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. Success rates drop from 46.9% on gameplay tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks. Simple multimodal feedback improved Claude Sonnet 4.5 from 33.3% to 47.7% performance.

Conclusion: GameDevBench addresses the gap in multimodal agent evaluation and demonstrates that game development is a challenging but valuable testbed. Simple multimodal feedback mechanisms can significantly improve agent performance, highlighting the importance of multimodal understanding for complex software tasks.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress on coding agents, progress on their multimodal counterparts has lagged behind. A key challenge is the scarcity of evaluation testbeds that combine the complexity of software development with the need for deep multimodal understanding. Game development provides such a testbed as agents must navigate large, dense codebases while manipulating intrinsically multimodal assets such as shaders, sprites, and animations within a visual game scene. We present GameDevBench, the first benchmark for evaluating agents on game development tasks. GameDevBench consists of 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and are complex -- the average solution requires over three times the amount of lines of code and file changes compared to prior software development benchmarks. Agents still struggle with game development, with the best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. We find a strong correlation between perceived task difficulty and multimodal complexity, with success rates dropping from 46.9% on gameplay-oriented tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks. To improve multimodal capability, we introduce two simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms for agents. Despite their simplicity, these methods consistently improve performance, with the largest change being an increase in Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance from 33.3% to 47.7%. We release GameDevBench publicly to support further research into agentic game development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neuro-symbolic framework called Formal-of-Thought that uses LLMs to translate natural language requirements into formal specifications for verifying agent safety, achieving 16.6% improvement over LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents operate in high-stakes domains requiring behavioral safety, but current LLM-as-a-Judge oversight faces a fundamental dilemma: probabilistic systems cannot reliably supervise other probabilistic systems without inheriting their failure modes. Formal verification offers a principled solution but is hindered by the bottleneck of translating natural language requirements to formal specifications.

Method: Proposes Formal-of-Thought, a neuro-symbolic framework with bidirectional architecture: LLMs serve as specification compilers that top-down decompose high-level human intent into atomic, verifiable constraints, then bottom-up prove compliance using Dafny specifications and Z3 SMT solving to produce mathematical guarantees rather than probabilistic scores.

Result: Achieves average 16.6% improvement over LLM-as-a-Judge baselines across three benchmarks (behavioral safety, multi-domain constraint adherence, agentic upward deception detection). Enables weak-to-strong generalization where a 7B judge achieves over 90% accuracy detecting deception from 72B agents. Provides near-linear safety improvement through iterative refinement.

Conclusion: Formal-of-Thought bridges the critical gap between natural language requirements and formal specifications, offering mathematically guaranteed safety verification for LLM-based agents, overcoming the limitations of probabilistic supervision approaches.

Abstract: As LLM-based agents increasingly operate in high-stakes domains with real-world consequences, ensuring their behavioral safety becomes paramount. The dominant oversight paradigm, LLM-as-a-Judge, faces a fundamental dilemma: how can probabilistic systems reliably supervise other probabilistic systems without inheriting their failure modes? We argue that formal verification offers a principled escape from this dilemma, yet its adoption has been hindered by a critical bottleneck: the translation from natural language requirements to formal specifications. This paper bridges this gap by proposing , a neuro-symbolic framework that employs a bidirectional Formal-of-Thought architecture: LLMs serve as specification compilers that top-down decompose high-level human intent into atomic, verifiable constraints, then bottom-up prove compliance using Dafny specifications and Z3 Satisfiability modulo theories solving, which produces mathematical guarantees rather than probabilistic scores. We validate across three benchmarks spanning behavioral safety, multi-domain constraint adherence, and agentic upward deception detection. Experiments on 7 agent models demonstrate that achieves an average improvement of 16.6% over LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, enables weak-to-strong generalization where a 7B judge achieves over 90% accuracy detecting deception from 72B agents, and provides near-linear safety improvement through iterative refinement.

### [250] [Boiling flow parameter estimation from boundary layer data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10394)
*Jeffrey W. Utley,Gregery T. Buzzard,Charles A. Bouman,Matthew R. Kemnetz*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Researchers developed a method to estimate boiling flow simulation parameters from measured aero-optic phase aberration data, achieving reasonable temporal statistics fit but poor spatial statistics match.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical experiments for studying atmospheric turbulence and aero-optic effects on light propagation are expensive and time-intensive. Existing simulation methods like boiling flow require physical parameters that aren't well-defined for aero-optic effects, creating a need for parameter estimation from measured data.

Method: Developed an algorithm to estimate boiling flow parameters by fitting spatial and temporal statistics of measured aero-optic phase aberration data. The method is computationally efficient and estimates parameters to match both spatial structure and temporal power spectral density.

Result: The temporal power spectral density of synthetic phase screens matched measured data reasonably well (8-9% error) for two turbulent boundary layer datasets. However, the spatial structure function showed poor match (above 28% error), indicating boiling flow can fit temporal statistics but not complex spatial statistics of aero-optic phase aberrations.

Conclusion: While boiling flow parameters can be estimated to reasonably fit temporal statistics of convective aero-optic data, the method fails to capture the complex spatial statistics, suggesting limitations of boiling flow for modeling aero-optic phase aberrations despite its computational efficiency.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence and aero-optic effects cause phase aberrations in propagating light waves, thereby reducing effectiveness in transmitting and receiving coherent light from an aircraft. Existing optical sensors can measure the resulting phase aberrations, but the physical experiments required to induce these aberrations are expensive and time-intensive. Simulation methods could provide a less expensive alternative. For example, an existing simulation algorithm called boiling flow, which generalizes the Taylor frozen-flow method, can generate synthetic phase aberration data (i.e., phase screens) induced by atmospheric turbulence. However, boiling flow depends on physical parameters, such as the Fried coherence length r0, which are not well-defined for aero-optic effects. In this paper, we introduce a method to estimate the parameters of boiling flow from measured aero-optic phase aberration data. Our algorithm estimates these parameters to fit the spatial and temporal statistics of the measured data. This method is computationally efficient and our experiments show that the temporal power spectral density of the slopes of the synthetic phase screens reasonably matches that of the measured phase aberrations from two turbulent boundary layer data sets, with errors between 8-9%. However, the Kolmogorov spatial structure function of the phase screens does not match that of the measured phase aberrations, with errors above 28%. This suggests that, while the parameters of boiling flow can reasonably fit the temporal statistics of highly convective data, they cannot fit the complex spatial statistics of aero-optic phase aberrations.

Motivation: Visual perception struggles with liquid level estimation due to specular/refraction effects and lighting variability in robotic pouring tasks.

Method: Real-time mmWave radar pipeline with high-resolution range-angle beamforming for sensing, plus physics-informed mid-pour tracker to suppress multipath and maintain lock on liquid surface.

Result: Achieves 0.35 cm median absolute height error at 0.62 ms per update, outperforming vision and ultrasound baselines in real-robot water-pouring experiments.

Conclusion: RadarEye provides robust, low-latency liquid level estimation for robotic pouring by overcoming limitations of visual perception through mmWave radar processing.

Abstract: Transparent liquid manipulation in robotic pouring remains challenging for perception systems: specular/refraction effects and lighting variability degrade visual cues, undermining reliable level estimation. To address this challenge, we introduce RadarEye, a real-time mmWave radar signal processing pipeline for robust liquid level estimation and tracking during the whole pouring process. RadarEye integrates (i) a high-resolution range-angle beamforming module for liquid level sensing and (ii) a physics-informed mid-pour tracker that suppresses multipath to maintain lock on the liquid surface despite stream-induced clutter and source container reflections. The pipeline delivers sub-millisecond latency. In real-robot water-pouring experiments, RadarEye achieves a 0.35 cm median absolute height error at 0.62 ms per update, substantially outperforming vision and ultrasound baselines.

TL;DR: Proposed a nonparametric Bayesian learning framework for OTFS channel estimation that captures structured sparsity and clustering characteristics of realistic CDL channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OTFS channel estimation methods overlook structured sparsity and clustering characteristics of realistic clustered delay line (CDL) channels, leading to degraded performance in practical high-mobility 6G systems.

Method: Novel nonparametric Bayesian learning framework using stick-breaking process to automatically infer multipath components and assign paths to clusters, modeling channel coefficients with Gaussian mixture distributions, and implementing pruning criteria to eliminate spurious components.

Result: Simulation results show superior performance in normalized mean squared error compared to existing methods, with enhanced estimation accuracy and reduced computational complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed NPBL framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing OTFS channel estimation methods by capturing realistic channel characteristics, making it suitable for high-mobility 6G networks.

Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has demonstrated significant advantages in high-mobility scenarios in future 6G networks. However, existing channel estimation methods often overlook the structured sparsity and clustering characteristics inherent in realistic clustered delay line (CDL) channels, leading to degraded performance in practical systems. To address this issue, we propose a novel nonparametric Bayesian learning (NPBL) framework for OTFS channel estimation. Specifically, a stick-breaking process is introduced to automatically infer the number of multipath components and assign each path to its corresponding cluster. The channel coefficients within each cluster are modeled by a Gaussian mixture distribution to capture complex fading statistics. Furthermore, an effective pruning criterion is designed to eliminate spurious multipath components, thereby enhancing estimation accuracy and reducing computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in terms of normalized mean squared error compared to existing methods.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive review of clutter characterization and suppression techniques for wideband MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems, covering both cold and hot clutter types, and discusses proactive transceiver co-design approaches for clutter avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clutter (both cold from environmental backscatter and hot from external interference) is a fundamental bottleneck for reliable sensing in wideband ISAC systems, especially in scattering-rich environments where weak target reflections are dominated by clutter.

Method: Develops a unified wideband MIMO-OFDM signal model capturing both clutter types across space, time, and frequency domains. Reviews clutter characterization at multiple levels (amplitude statistics, SIRV modeling, structured covariance), receiver-side suppression methods (temporal/spatial domains, STAP/SFTAP), and clutter-aware transceiver co-design with beamforming/waveform optimization under QoS constraints.

Result: Provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing clutter in ISAC systems, including guidance on technique selection under different waveform and interference conditions, and proactive approaches to clutter avoidance through transceiver co-design.

Conclusion: The paper establishes foundations for clutter-resilient ISAC and identifies open challenges toward environment-adaptive systems for next-generation networks, emphasizing the need to move beyond reactive suppression to proactive clutter-aware design.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can substantially improve spectral, hardware, and energy efficiency by unifying radar sensing and data communications. In wideband and scattering-rich environments, clutter often dominates weak target reflections and becomes a fundamental bottleneck for reliable sensing. Practical ISAC clutter includes "cold" clutter arising from environmental backscatter of the probing waveform, and "hot" clutter induced by external interference and reflections from the environment whose statistics can vary rapidly over time. In this article, we develop a unified wideband multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) signal model that captures both clutter types across the space, time, and frequency domains. Building on this model, we review clutter characterization at multiple levels, including amplitude statistics, robust spherically invariant random vector (SIRV) modeling, and structured covariance representations suitable for limited-snapshot regimes. We then summarize receiver-side suppression methods in the temporal and spatial domains, together with extensions to space-time adaptive processing (STAP) and space-frequency-time adaptive processing (SFTAP), and we provide guidance on selecting techniques under different waveform and interference conditions. To move beyond reactive suppression, we discuss clutter-aware transceiver co-design that couples beamforming and waveform optimization with practical communication quality-of-service (QoS) constraints to enable proactive clutter avoidance. We conclude with open challenges and research directions toward environment-adaptive and clutter-resilient ISAC for next-generation networks.

Conclusion: The proposed transfer learning framework effectively addresses the domain gap between ground and aerial data, enabling high-fidelity route-level radio map prediction for UAV communication planning with limited real measurements.

Abstract: The expansion of the low-altitude economy is contingent on reliable cellular connectivity for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A key challenge in pre-flight planning is predicting communication link quality along proposed and pre-defined routes, a task hampered by sparse measurements that render existing radio map methods ineffective. This paper introduces a transfer learning framework for high-fidelity route-level radio map prediction. Our key insight is to leverage abundant crowdsourced ground signals as auxiliary supervision. To bridge the significant domain gap between ground and aerial data and address spatial sparsity, our framework learns general propagation priors from simulation, performs adversarial alignment of the feature spaces, and is fine-tuned on limited real UAV measurements. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from Meituan show that our method achieves over 50% higher accuracy in predicting Route RSRP compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: Active RIS-assisted satellite downlink design with stochastic reliability framework addressing interference, amplifier noise, and regulatory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active RIS can mitigate double-fading in satellite downlinks but faces limitations from random co-channel interference, gain-dependent amplifier noise, and emission constraints.

Method: Develops stochastic reliability framework modeling channels and noise as random variables. Formulates chance-constrained max-SINR design with binary RIS configuration and common amplification gain optimization. Uses sample-average approximation and solves as mixed-integer second-order cone program with bisection search.

Result: Derives SINR envelopes with eigenvalue and l1-norm bounds that tightly bound simulated SINR and reproduce saturation behavior. Achieves reliability targets validated through out-of-sample Monte Carlo testing under realistic constraints.

Conclusion: Provides solver-ready, reliability-targeting design methodology for active RIS-assisted satellite downlinks that handles practical hardware constraints and validates achieved reliability through comprehensive testing.

Abstract: Active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can mitigate the double-fading loss of passive reflection in satellite downlinks. However, their gains are limited by random co-channel interference, gain-dependent amplifier noise, and regulatory emission constraints. This paper develops a stochastic reliability framework for active RIS-assisted satellite downlinks by modeling the desired and interfering channels, receiver noise, and RIS amplifier noise as random variables. The resulting instantaneous signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) model explicitly captures folded cascaded amplifier noise and reveals a finite high-gain SINR ceiling.
  To guarantee a target outage level, we formulate a chance-constrained max-SINR design that jointly optimizes the binary RIS configuration and a common amplification gain. The chance constraint is handled using a sample-average approximation (SAA) with a violation budget. The resulting feasibility problem is solved as a mixed-integer second-order cone program (MISOCP) within a bisection search over the SINR threshold. Practical implementation is enforced by restricting the gain to an admissible range determined by small-signal stability and effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) limits.
  We also derive realization-wise SINR envelopes based on eigenvalue and l1-norm bounds, which provide interpretable performance limits and fast diagnostics. Monte Carlo results show that these envelopes tightly bound the simulated SINR, reproduce the predicted saturation behavior, and quantify performance degradation as interference increases. Overall, the paper provides a solver-ready, reliability-targeting design methodology whose achieved reliability is validated through out-of-sample Monte Carlo testing under realistic randomness and hardware constraints.

TL;DR: This paper develops a maximum-likelihood Gaussian-phase approximate (ML-G) detector for single-carrier systems with Nakagami-m interference, and designs interference-aware constellations that outperform conventional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional detection methods based on Gaussian noise models are suboptimal for Nakagami-m interference, which has random amplitude and non-uniform phase that fundamentally affects symbol-level performance and optimal decision regions.

Method: Developed the ML-G detector that incorporates interference statistics and induces non-conventional decision regions. Also formulated constellation design optimization to minimize symbol error probability under average energy constraints, resulting in numerically obtained asymmetric constellations.

Result: Simulation results show clear symbol error probability gains over benchmark schemes across interference conditions, especially with dominant additive interference. The resulting constellations adapt to interference environment with non-standard asymmetric structures.

Conclusion: The proposed ML-G detector and interference-aware constellation design effectively address detection mismatch in Nakagami-m interference environments, providing practical implementation advantages over conventional Euclidean distance-based approaches.

Abstract: This paper investigates symbol detection for single-carrier communication systems operating in the presence of additive interference with Nakagami-m statistics. Such interference departs from the assumptions underlying conventional detection methods based on Gaussian noise models and leads to detection mismatch that fundamentally affects symbol-level performance. In particular, the presence of random interference amplitude and non-uniform phase alters the structure of the optimal decision regions and renders standard Euclidean distance-based detectors suboptimal. To address this challenge, we develop the maximum-likelihood Gaussian-phase approximate (ML-G) detector, a low-complexity detection rule that accurately approximates maximum-likelihood detection while remaining suitable for practical implementation. The proposed detector explicitly incorporates the statistical properties of the interference and induces decision regions that differ significantly from those arising under conventional metrics. Building on the ML-G framework, we further investigate constellation design under interference-aware detection and formulate an optimization problem that seeks symbol placements that minimize the symbol error probability subject to an average energy constraint. The resulting constellations are obtained numerically and adapt to the interference environment, exhibiting non-standard and asymmetric structures as interference strength increases. Simulation results demonstrate clear symbol error probability gains over established benchmark schemes across a range of interference conditions, particularly in scenarios with dominant additive interference.

TL;DR: DiG: A Bayesian framework for signal component decomposition using Gibbs sampling with plug-and-play diffusion priors that draws samples from posterior distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world sensing data often contains noisy linear mixtures of multiple components, requiring effective component estimation as a crucial pre-processing step in signal processing.

Method: Combines Gibbs sampling with plug-and-play diffusion priors in a Bayesian framework, allowing model-driven and data-driven prior knowledge to be incorporated into diffusion priors. Component priors can be learned separately and flexibly combined without retraining.

Result: The DiG sampler provably produces samples from posterior distribution under suitable assumptions, better exploits measurement model structure for certain sensing operators, and demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: DiG provides a unified Bayesian framework for signal component decomposition that effectively combines model-driven and data-driven priors, offers theoretical guarantees, and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: In signal processing, the data collected from sensing devices is often a noisy linear superposition of multiple components, and the estimation of components of interest constitutes a crucial pre-processing step. In this work, we develop a Bayesian framework for signal component decomposition, which combines Gibbs sampling with plug-and-play (PnP) diffusion priors to draw component samples from the posterior distribution. Unlike many existing methods, our framework supports incorporating model-driven and data-driven prior knowledge into the diffusion prior in a unified manner. Moreover, the proposed posterior sampler allows component priors to be learned separately and flexibly combined without retraining. Under suitable assumptions, the proposed DiG sampler provably produces samples from the posterior distribution. We also show that DiG can be interpreted as an extension of a class of recently proposed diffusion-based samplers, and that, for suitable classes of sensing operators, DiG better exploits the structure of the measurement model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method over existing approaches.

Result: Common simplified models are sufficient for basic beamfocusing applications, but fail to accurately predict sidelobes and the frequency dependence of reflecting structures.

Conclusion: While existing simplified models work for basic beamfocusing, a more physically consistent model is needed for accurate prediction of sidelobes and frequency-dependent behavior in near-field multi-antenna systems.

Abstract: Near-field multi-antenna wireless communication has attracted growing research interest in recent years. Despite this development, most of the current literature on antennas and reflecting structures relies on simplified models, whose validity for real systems remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce a physically consistent near-field model, which we use to evaluate commonly used models. Our results indicate that common models are sufficient for basic beamfocusing, but fail to accurately predict the sidelobes and frequency dependence of reflecting structures.

Motivation: Future networks need joint support for connectivity, power delivery, and environmental awareness through same infrastructure. Current systems face challenges with near-far disparities and multi-signal interference between tags and targets.

Method: Formulated transmit-power minimization problem optimizing BS beamformers, sensing covariance matrix, reader beamformers, tag reflection coefficients, and fluid-antenna positions. Used alternating-optimization block-coordinate framework with semidefinite relaxation, majorization-minimization, and successive convex approximation.

Result: Numerical results show consistent transmit-power savings: about 13.7% reduction over fixed-position antennas and 54.5% reduction over zero-forcing baselines.

Conclusion: Fluid antennas provide additional spatial degrees of freedom to reshape multi-hop channels, effectively mitigating near-far disparities and multi-signal interference in integrated sensing and communication systems.

Abstract: This paper studies a fluid-antenna-enabled integrated bistatic sensing and backscatter communication system for future networks where connectivity, power delivery, and environmental awareness are jointly supported by the same infrastructure. A multi-antenna base station (BS) with transmitting fluid antennas serves downlink users, energizes passive tags, and illuminates radar targets, while a spatially separated multi-antenna reader decodes tag backscatter and processes radar echoes to avoid the strong self-interference that would otherwise obscure weak returns at the BS. The coexistence of tags and targets, however, induces severe near--far disparities and multi-signal interference, which can be mitigated by fluid antennas through additional spatial degrees of freedom that reshape the multi-hop channels. We formulate a transmit-power minimization problem that jointly optimizes the BS information beamformers, sensing covariance matrix, reader receive beamformers, tag reflection coefficients, and fluid-antenna (FA) positions under heterogeneous quality of service constraints for communication, backscatter, and sensing, as well as energy-harvesting and FA geometry requirements. To tackle the resulting non-convex problem, we develop an alternating-optimization block-coordinate framework that solves four tractable subproblems using semidefinite relaxation, majorization--minimization, and successive convex approximation. Numerical results show consistent transmit-power savings over fixed-position antennas and zero-forcing baselines, achieving about 13.7% and 54.5% reductions, respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data transmission from superconducting SFQ logic to CMOS circuits suffers from bit errors due to flux trapping, process parameter variations, and fabrication defects, requiring error correction.

Method: Design and implementation of a Reed-Muller RM(1,3) encoder using SFQ digital logic (MIT-LL SFQ5ee process, SuperTools/ColdFlux library) with simulation framework combining JoSIM and MATLAB for automated analysis.

Result: The encoder improves probability of no bit errors by 6.7% compared to encoder-less design under ±20% PPV, and corrects all errors with ≥99.1% probability at ±15% or lower PPV. Also studied impact of fabrication defects like open circuit faults.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight RM(1,3) encoder effectively mitigates errors in SFQ-to-CMOS data transmission, demonstrating significant improvement in reliability under process variations and providing a framework for defect analysis.

Abstract: Data transmission from superconducting digital electronics such as single flux quantum (SFQ) logic to semiconductor (CMOS) circuits is subject to bit errors due to, e.g., flux trapping, process parameter variations (PPV), and fabrication defects. In this paper, a lightweight hardware-efficient error-correction code encoder is designed and analyzed. Particularly, a Reed-Muller code RM(1,3) encoder is implemented with SFQ digital logic. The proposed RM(1,3) encoder converts a 4-bit message into an 8-bit codeword and can detect and correct up to 3- and 1-bit errors, respectively. This encoder circuit is designed using MIT-LL SFQ5ee process and SuperTools/ColdFlux RSFQ cell library. A simulation framework integrating JoSIM simulator and MATLAB script for automated data collection and analysis, is proposed to study the performance of RM(1,3) encoder. The proposed encoder improves the probability of having no bit errors by 6.7% as compared to an encoder-less design under $\pm20\%$ PPV. With $\pm15\%$ and lower PPV, the proposed encoder could correct all errors with at least 99.1% probability. The impact of fabrication defects such as open circuit faults on the encoder circuit is also studied using the proposed framework.

TL;DR: Real-time autonomous driving framework using conditional flow matching for joint trajectory prediction and planning, with adaptive inference steps and convex post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like diffusion models have high latency (hundreds of denoising steps), while consistency models require expensive retraining for noise schedule tuning. Need real-time, multimodal trajectory generation for autonomous driving.

Method: Conditional flow matching framework that jointly predicts surrounding agent motions and plans ego trajectory. Includes lightweight variance estimator for adaptive inference steps (no retraining needed) and convex quadratic program post-processing for ride quality.

Result: Achieves 20 Hz update rate on NVIDIA RTX 3070 GPU, handles maneuvers like lane changes, cruise control, and unprotected left turns without scenario-specific tuning. Outperforms transformer, diffusion, and consistency models in trajectory smoothness and dynamic constraint adherence.

Conclusion: Proposed flow matching framework enables real-time autonomous driving with adaptive inference, eliminating retraining needs while maintaining performance and computational efficiency suitable for online deployment.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires reasoning about interactions with surrounding traffic. A prevailing approach is large-scale imitation learning on expert driving datasets, aimed at generalizing across diverse real-world scenarios. For online trajectory generation, such methods must operate at real-time rates. Diffusion models require hundreds of denoising steps at inference, resulting in high latency. Consistency models mitigate this issue but rely on carefully tuned noise schedules to capture the multimodal action distributions common in autonomous driving. Adapting the schedule, typically requires expensive retraining. To address these limitations, we propose a framework based on conditional flow matching that jointly predicts future motions of surrounding agents and plans the ego trajectory in real time. We train a lightweight variance estimator that selects the number of inference steps online, removing the need for retraining to balance runtime and imitation learning performance. To further enhance ride quality, we introduce a trajectory post-processing step cast as a convex quadratic program, with negligible computational overhead. Trained on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, the framework performs maneuvers such as lane changes, cruise control, and navigating unprotected left turns without requiring scenario-specific tuning. Our method maintains a 20 Hz update rate on an NVIDIA RTX 3070 GPU, making it suitable for online deployment. Compared to transformer, diffusion, and consistency model baselines, we achieve improved trajectory smoothness and better adherence to dynamic constraints.

*Rohan Banerjee,Krishna Palempalli,Bohan Yang,Jiaying Fang,Alif Abdullah,Tom Silver,Sarah Dean,Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A human-in-the-loop failure-recovery framework for modular robotic policies that uses module-level uncertainty and human intervention cost models to decide when and which module to query, improving recovery success while reducing user workload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots in unstructured human environments often fail, especially in caregiving scenarios. While humans can help robots recover, excessive or poorly targeted queries impose unnecessary cognitive and physical workload on human partners.

Method: A modular policy framework with calibrated module-level uncertainty estimates and human intervention cost models. Separates module selection (identifying most likely failed module) from querying decisions (when to solicit human input vs. autonomous action). Evaluated multiple module-selection strategies and querying algorithms.

Result: Framework improves recovery success while reducing user workload in robot-assisted bite acquisition system studies with individuals having emulated and real mobility limitations. Synthetic experiments reveal trade-offs between recovery efficiency, robustness, and user workload.

Conclusion: Explicitly reasoning about both robot uncertainty and human effort enables more efficient and user-centered failure recovery in collaborative robots, balancing recovery success with reduced cognitive/physical burden on human partners.

Abstract: Robots operating in unstructured human environments inevitably encounter failures, especially in robot caregiving scenarios. While humans can often help robots recover, excessive or poorly targeted queries impose unnecessary cognitive and physical workload on the human partner. We present a human-in-the-loop failure-recovery framework for modular robotic policies, where a policy is composed of distinct modules such as perception, planning, and control, any of which may fail and often require different forms of human feedback. Our framework integrates calibrated estimates of module-level uncertainty with models of human intervention cost to decide which module to query and when to query the human. It separates these two decisions: a module selector identifies the module most likely responsible for failure, and a querying algorithm determines whether to solicit human input or act autonomously. We evaluate several module-selection strategies and querying algorithms in controlled synthetic experiments, revealing trade-offs between recovery efficiency, robustness to system and user variables, and user workload. Finally, we deploy the framework on a robot-assisted bite acquisition system and demonstrate, in studies involving individuals with both emulated and real mobility limitations, that it improves recovery success while reducing the workload imposed on users. Our results highlight how explicitly reasoning about both robot uncertainty and human effort can enable more efficient and user-centered failure recovery in collaborative robots.

*Nick Gorman,Gage MacLin,Maxwell Hammond,Venanzio Cichella*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Trajectory planning using composite Bernstein polynomials for autonomous systems in complex environments, with continuous paths, obstacle avoidance via cost surfaces, and efficient symbolic optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for efficient trajectory planning for autonomous systems (ground, aerial, underwater, space) in complex environments with obstacles, requiring continuous paths, precise control, and computational efficiency for limited onboard resources.

Method: Composite Bernstein polynomials in symbolic optimization framework; trajectories planned over continuous cost surfaces encoding obstacles as fields; three constraint types: Gaussian surface inequality for obstacle clearance, geodesic equations for efficient paths, and boundary constraints for start/end conditions.

Result: Efficient generation of smooth, collision-free paths in multi-obstacle scenarios; maintains clearance without extensive sampling/post-processing; enables continuous, dynamically feasible trajectories with high numerical efficiency for various applications.

Conclusion: Method provides efficient trajectory planning using composite Bernstein polynomials with symbolic optimization, suitable as standalone planner or initializer for complex motion planning problems across diverse autonomous systems.

Abstract: This work presents a trajectory planning method based on composite Bernstein polynomials for autonomous systems navigating complex environments. The method is implemented in a symbolic optimization framework that enables continuous paths and precise control over trajectory shape. Trajectories are planned over a cost surface that encodes obstacles as continuous fields rather than discrete boundaries. Regions near obstacles are assigned higher costs, naturally encouraging the trajectory to maintain a safe distance while still allowing efficient routing through constrained spaces. The use of composite Bernstein polynomials preserves continuity while enabling fine control over local curvature to satisfy geodesic constraints. The symbolic representation supports exact derivatives, improving optimization efficiency. The method applies to both two- and three-dimensional environments and is suitable for ground, aerial, underwater, and space systems. In spacecraft trajectory planning, for example, it enables the generation of continuous, dynamically feasible trajectories with high numerical efficiency, making it well suited for orbital maneuvers, rendezvous and proximity operations, cluttered gravitational environments, and planetary exploration missions with limited onboard computational resources. Demonstrations show that the approach efficiently generates smooth, collision-free paths in scenarios with multiple obstacles, maintaining clearance without extensive sampling or post-processing. The optimization incorporates three constraint types: (1) a Gaussian surface inequality enforcing minimum obstacle clearance; (2) geodesic equations guiding the path along locally efficient directions on the cost surface; and (3) boundary constraints enforcing fixed start and end conditions. The method can serve as a standalone planner or as an initializer for more complex motion planning problems.

TL;DR: First work integrating foundation models for real-time legged locomotion adaptation using high-level reasoning from environmental semantics and human instructions, achieving 87% instruction-following accuracy without cloud queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current legged locomotion learning is limited by geometric environment representations, lacking ability to respond to higher-level semantics like human instructions. Need to integrate commonsense reasoning from foundation models for more intelligent adaptation.

Method: 1) Use pre-trained LLM to synthesize instruction-grounded skill database for legged robots. 2) Employ pre-trained VLM to extract high-level environmental semantics and ground them in skill database for real-time skill advisories. 3) Train style-conditioned policy to generate diverse, robust locomotion skills with high fidelity to specified styles.

Result: Achieves instruction-following accuracy up to 87% without needing online queries to cloud-based foundation models. Demonstrates first real-time adaptation of legged locomotion using high-level reasoning from environmental semantics and instructions.

Conclusion: Successfully integrates foundation models for semantic-aware legged locomotion, enabling robots to respond to human instructions and environmental semantics in real-time, advancing beyond geometric-only representations.

Abstract: Recent advances in legged locomotion learning are still dominated by the utilization of geometric representations of the environment, limiting the robot's capability to respond to higher-level semantics such as human instructions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that integrates high-level commonsense reasoning from foundation models into the process of legged locomotion adaptation. Specifically, our method utilizes a pre-trained large language model to synthesize an instruction-grounded skill database tailored for legged robots. A pre-trained vision-language model is employed to extract high-level environmental semantics and ground them within the skill database, enabling real-time skill advisories for the robot. To facilitate versatile skill control, we train a style-conditioned policy capable of generating diverse and robust locomotion skills with high fidelity to specified styles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate real-time adaptation of legged locomotion using high-level reasoning from environmental semantics and instructions with instruction-following accuracy of up to 87% without the need for online query to on-the-cloud foundation models.

TL;DR: LifeLong-RFT: A reinforcement fine-tuning strategy for Vision-Language-Action models that uses multi-dimensional process rewards to enable efficient multi-task and continual learning without requiring online environmental feedback or pre-trained reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for VLA models requires large task-specific datasets and suffers from catastrophic forgetting, limiting their adaptability and efficiency in downstream domains.

Method: Proposes LifeLong-RFT with chunking-level on-policy reinforcement learning and Multi-Dimensional Process Reward (MDPR) mechanism. MDPR includes three reward components: Quantized Action Consistency Reward (QACR) for discrete action accuracy, Continuous Trajectory Alignment Reward (CTAR) for continuous action alignment, and Format Compliance Reward (FCR) for output structural validity.

Result: Achieves strong performance in multi-task learning across SimplerEnv, LIBERO, and real-world tasks. For continual learning on LIBERO benchmark, achieves 22% gain in average success rate over SFT while using only 20% of training data for new task adaptation.

Conclusion: LifeLong-RFT provides an effective post-training paradigm for VLA models that addresses SFT limitations, enabling efficient multi-task and continual learning with reduced data requirements and improved performance.

Abstract: Pretrained on large-scale and diverse datasets, VLA models demonstrate strong generalization and adaptability as general-purpose robotic policies. However, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which serves as the primary mechanism for adapting VLAs to downstream domains, requires substantial amounts of task-specific data and is prone to catastrophic forgetting. To address these limitations, we propose LifeLong-RFT, a simple yet effective Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) strategy for VLA models independent of online environmental feedback and pre-trained reward models. By integrating chunking-level on-policy reinforcement learning with the proposed Multi-Dimensional Process Reward (MDPR) mechanism, LifeLong-RFT quantifies the heterogeneous contributions of intermediate action chunks across three dimensions to facilitate policy optimization. Specifically, (1) the Quantized Action Consistency Reward (QACR) ensures accurate action prediction within the discrete action space; (2) the Continuous Trajectory Alignment Reward (CTAR) aligns decoded continuous action chunks with reference trajectories to ensure precise control; (3) the Format Compliance Reward (FCR) guarantees the structural validity of outputs. Comprehensive experiments across SimplerEnv, LIBERO, and real-world tasks demonstrate that LifeLong-RFT exhibits strong performance in multi-task learning. Furthermore, for continual learning on the LIBERO benchmark, our method achieves a 22% gain in average success rate over SFT, while effectively adapting to new tasks using only 20% of the training data. Overall, our method provides a promising post-training paradigm for VLAs.

TL;DR: Two quadruped robots coordinate to jump 1.5m high without communication, achieving 144% improvement over solo jumps using decentralized reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individual legged robots are limited by physical actuation constraints. The paper aims to transcend these limits through cooperative jumping where two robots synchronize to achieve jumps far beyond their solo capabilities, enabling communication-free collaboration in constrained environments.

Method: Uses Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) enhanced with progressive curriculum strategy to overcome sparse-reward exploration challenges in mechanically coupled systems. The framework operates in a decentralized setting without explicit communication or pre-specified motion primitives, relying solely on proprioceptive feedback.

Result: Successfully demonstrated robust performance in simulation and transferred to physical hardware, executing multi-directional jumps onto platforms up to 1.5m height. One robot achieved 1.1m foot-end elevation, representing 144% improvement over the 0.45m solo jump height of a standalone quadruped robot.

Conclusion: The Co-jump framework enables precise coordination between robots without communication, establishing a foundation for communication-free collaborative locomotion in constrained environments and demonstrating that cooperative tasks can significantly transcend individual robot physical limitations.

Abstract: While single-agent legged locomotion has witnessed remarkable progress, individual robots remain fundamentally constrained by physical actuation limits. To transcend these boundaries, we introduce Co-jump, a cooperative task where two quadrupedal robots synchronize to execute jumps far beyond their solo capabilities. We tackle the high-impulse contact dynamics of this task under a decentralized setting, achieving synchronization without explicit communication or pre-specified motion primitives. Our framework leverages Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) enhanced by a progressive curriculum strategy, which effectively overcomes the sparse-reward exploration challenges inherent in mechanically coupled systems. We demonstrate robust performance in simulation and successful transfer to physical hardware, executing multi-directional jumps onto platforms up to 1.5 m in height. Specifically, one of the robots achieves a foot-end elevation of 1.1 m, which represents a 144% improvement over the 0.45 m jump height of a standalone quadrupedal robot, demonstrating superior vertical performance. Notably, this precise coordination is achieved solely through proprioceptive feedback, establishing a foundation for communication-free collaborative locomotion in constrained environments.

TL;DR: A framework for adaptive multi-sensor fusion that dynamically adjusts sensor configurations (frequency, resolution, range) based on real-time environmental conditions to reduce computational load while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-sensor fusion systems operate with static configurations, wasting bandwidth, computation, and energy. They cannot adapt to challenging conditions like poor lighting or occlusion, and ignore the physical cost of sensor data collection.

Method: A closed-loop framework unifying sensing, learning, and actuation. A detection backbone extracts multi-spectral features and produces modality contribution scores. An RL agent uses these scores to dynamically adjust sensor configurations (sampling frequency, resolution, sensing range) in real-time, down-sampling or deactivating less informative sensors while increasing fidelity for critical ones.

Result: Implementation on a mobile rover shows adaptive control reduces GPU load by 29.3% with only a 5.3% accuracy drop compared to a heuristic baseline.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of resource-aware adaptive sensing for embedded robotic platforms, enabling efficient multi-sensor fusion that adapts to environmental conditions while reducing computational burden.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion is central to robust robotic perception, yet most existing systems operate under static sensor configurations, collecting all modalities at fixed rates and fidelity regardless of their situational utility. This rigidity wastes bandwidth, computation, and energy, and prevents systems from prioritizing sensors under challenging conditions such as poor lighting or occlusion. Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) and modality-aware fusion suggest the potential for adaptive perception, but prior efforts have largely focused on re-weighting features at inference time, ignoring the physical cost of sensor data collection. We introduce a framework that unifies sensing, learning, and actuation into a closed reconfiguration loop. A task-specific detection backbone extracts multispectral features (e.g. RGB, IR, mmWave, depth) and produces quantitative contribution scores for each modality. These scores are passed to an RL agent, which dynamically adjusts sensor configurations, including sampling frequency, resolution, sensing range, and etc., in real time. Less informative sensors are down-sampled or deactivated, while critical sensors are sampled at higher fidelity as environmental conditions evolve. We implement and evaluate this framework on a mobile rover, showing that adaptive control reduces GPU load by 29.3\% with only a 5.3\% accuracy drop compared to a heuristic baseline. These results highlight the potential of resource-aware adaptive sensing for embedded robotic platforms.

Motivation: Existing Vision-Language-Action models remain tightly coupled to their training embodiments and require costly fine-tuning for new robots, limiting generalist robot policies.

Method: Language-Action Pre-training (LAP) represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution without learned tokenizers or embodiment-specific designs.

Result: LAP-3B achieves over 50% average zero-shot success across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, roughly 2x improvement over prior VLAs, and enables efficient adaptation and scaling.

Conclusion: LAP provides a simple recipe for generalist robot policies that can transfer zero-shot to new embodiments, unifying action prediction and VQA in a shared language-action format.

Abstract: A long-standing goal in robotics is a generalist policy that can be deployed zero-shot on new robot embodiments without per-embodiment adaptation. Despite large-scale multi-embodiment pre-training, existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) remain tightly coupled to their training embodiments and typically require costly fine-tuning. We introduce Language-Action Pre-training (LAP), a simple recipe that represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with the pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution. LAP requires no learned tokenizer, no costly annotation, and no embodiment-specific architectural design. Based on LAP, we present LAP-3B, which to the best of our knowledge is the first VLA to achieve substantial zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot embodiments without any embodiment-specific fine-tuning. Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs. We further show that LAP enables efficient adaptation and favorable scaling, while unifying action prediction and VQA in a shared language-action format that yields additional gains through co-training.

TL;DR: A closed-loop automation framework for heterogeneous modular robots that handles full pipeline from morphological construction to adaptive control, featuring hierarchical planning and GPU-accelerated MPPI controller for real-time motion control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of dynamic assembly and immediate locomotion capability for heterogeneous modular robots, particularly dealing with state-space explosion in large-scale heterogeneous reconfiguration and enabling adaptive motion control for unknown assembled configurations.

Method: 1) Hierarchical planner: high-level uses bidirectional heuristic search with type-penalty terms for module-handling sequences; low-level uses A* search for execution trajectories. 2) GPU-accelerated Annealing-Variance Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller with multi-stage variance annealing strategy for configuration-agnostic motion control.

Result: Type-penalty term is critical for planning robustness in heterogeneous scenarios; greedy heuristic produces lower-cost plans than Hungarian heuristic; annealing-variance MPPI outperforms standard MPPI in velocity tracking accuracy and control frequency (50Hz real-time control). Framework validates full-cycle process including assembly, merging/splitting, and dynamic motion generation.

Conclusion: The proposed closed-loop automation framework successfully enables heterogeneous modular robots to dynamically assemble diverse configurations with immediate locomotion capability through hierarchical planning and adaptive real-time motion control, demonstrating robust performance in large-scale simulations.

Abstract: This paper presents a closed-loop automation framework for heterogeneous modular robots, covering the full pipeline from morphological construction to adaptive control. In this framework, a mobile manipulator handles heterogeneous functional modules including structural, joint, and wheeled modules to dynamically assemble diverse robot configurations and provide them with immediate locomotion capability. To address the state-space explosion in large-scale heterogeneous reconfiguration, we propose a hierarchical planner: the high-level planner uses a bidirectional heuristic search with type-penalty terms to generate module-handling sequences, while the low level planner employs A* search to compute optimal execution trajectories. This design effectively decouples discrete configuration planning from continuous motion execution. For adaptive motion generation of unknown assembled configurations, we introduce a GPU accelerated Annealing-Variance Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller. By incorporating a multi stage variance annealing strategy to balance global exploration and local convergence, the controller enables configuration-agnostic, real-time motion control. Large scale simulations show that the type-penalty term is critical for planning robustness in heterogeneous scenarios. Moreover, the greedy heuristic produces plans with lower physical execution costs than the Hungarian heuristic. The proposed annealing-variance MPPI significantly outperforms standard MPPI in both velocity tracking accuracy and control frequency, achieving real time control at 50 Hz. The framework validates the full-cycle process, including module assembly, robot merging and splitting, and dynamic motion generation.

*Runze Tang,Penny Sweetser*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SFCrP uses scene flow prediction from human and robot videos to enable cross-embodiment imitation learning with strong generalization, reducing the need for extensive robot demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning requires many robot demonstrations which are costly to collect. Existing flow-based methods using human videos have limitations: they focus on object or specific point flows that don't capture interaction motion, flow alone misses precise details, and flow-conditioned policies can overfit to training tasks while weakening generalization.

Method: Proposes SFCrP with two components: 1) SFCr (Scene Flow prediction model for Cross-embodiment learning) that learns from both robot and human videos to predict any point trajectories, and 2) FCrP (Flow and Cropped point cloud conditioned Policy) that follows general flow motion while adjusting actions based on observations for precision tasks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various real-world task settings, and exhibits strong spatial and instance generalization to scenarios seen only in human videos.

Conclusion: SFCrP effectively addresses limitations of prior flow-based imitation learning methods by combining scene flow prediction with observation-conditioned policy adjustment, enabling better generalization while reducing dependence on extensive robot demonstrations.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) enables robots to learn complex skills from demonstrations without explicit task modeling, but it typically requires large amounts of demonstrations, creating significant collection costs. Prior work has investigated using flow as an intermediate representation to enable the use of human videos as a substitute, thereby reducing the amount of required robot demonstrations. However, most prior work has focused on the flow, either on the object or on specific points of the robot/hand, which cannot describe the motion of interaction. Meanwhile, relying on flow to achieve generalization to scenarios observed only in human videos remains limited, as flow alone cannot capture precise motion details. Furthermore, conditioning on scene observation to produce precise actions may cause the flow-conditioned policy to overfit to training tasks and weaken the generalization indicated by the flow. To address these gaps, we propose SFCrP, which includes a Scene Flow prediction model for Cross-embodiment learning (SFCr) and a Flow and Cropped point cloud conditioned Policy (FCrP). SFCr learns from both robot and human videos and predicts any point trajectories. FCrP follows the general flow motion and adjusts the action based on observations for precision tasks. Our method outperforms SOTA baselines across various real-world task settings, while also exhibiting strong spatial and instance generalization to scenarios seen only in human videos.

TL;DR: A model-based framework using finite-element-informed MPC with sensor fusion enables precise magnetic pitch control of ingestible capsule robots for gastric procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing magnetically actuated capsule robot systems neglect pitch control, which is critical for contact-rich interaction with inclined gastric walls during minimally invasive GI procedures.

Method: Developed a nonlinear model-based framework using 3D finite-element simulations to characterize magnetic forces/torques, created a control-oriented rigid-body pitching model with lookup tables, designed constrained MPC for pitch regulation, and implemented EKF sensor fusion combining inertial sensing with intermittent visual measurements.

Result: Achieved robust pitch reorientation 3-5x faster settling with reduced oscillation compared to on-off control, and maintained stable closed-loop control even with camera update rates reduced from 30 Hz to 1 Hz (clinically realistic constraints).

Conclusion: Finite-element-informed MPC with sensor fusion provides a scalable strategy for pitch regulation, controlled docking, and future multi-degree-of-freedom capsule locomotion in GI tract applications.

Abstract: Magnetically actuated capsule robots promise minimally invasive diagnosis and therapy in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but existing systems largely neglect control of capsule pitch, a degree of freedom critical for contact-rich interaction with inclined gastric walls. This paper presents a nonlinear, model-based framework for magnetic pitch control of an ingestible capsule robot actuated by a four-coil electromagnetic array. Angle-dependent magnetic forces and torques acting on embedded permanent magnets are characterized using three-dimensional finite-element simulations and embedded as lookup tables in a control-oriented rigid-body pitching model with rolling contact and actuator dynamics. A constrained model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to regulate pitch while respecting hardware-imposed current and slew-rate limits. Experiments on a compliant stomach-inspired surface demonstrate robust pitch reorientation from both horizontal and upright configurations, achieving about three to five times faster settling and reduced oscillatory motion than on-off control. Furthermore, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) fusing inertial sensing with intermittent visual measurements enables stable closed-loop control when the camera update rate is reduced from 30 Hz to 1 Hz, emulating clinically realistic imaging constraints. These results establish finite-element-informed MPC with sensor fusion as a scalable strategy for pitch regulation, controlled docking, and future multi-degree-of-freedom capsule locomotion.

*Jin Zhou,Chongxun Wang,Zikang Shen,Fangzhou Xia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A 3D-printed soft capsule robot with magnetic coating replaces internal magnets, preserving full interior cavity for medical payloads while enabling stable locomotion and omnidirectional steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional magnetic capsule robots embed bulky permanent magnets at both ends, reducing usable cavity by 10-20 mm and limiting integration of functional modules. There's a need for more compact designs that preserve interior space for medical payloads.

Method: Developed a compact, 3D-printed soft capsule robot with a magnetic coating that replaces internal magnets. Used compliant silicone-magnetic composite shell with programmed NSSN/SNNS pole distributions for strong anisotropy and reliable torque generation.

Result: The design enables stable bidirectional rolling, omnidirectional steering, climbing on 7.5 degree inclines, and traversal of 5 mm protrusions. Rolling motion sustained with magnetic field ≥0.3 mT (effective actuation depth of 30 mm). Preserves entire interior cavity as continuous volume for medical payloads.

Conclusion: The magnetic coating approach successfully replaces internal magnets while maintaining locomotion capabilities. Future work will optimize materials and coating parameters, and develop next-generation field generators with closed-loop feedback to enhance performance and transition toward clinical deployment.

Abstract: Capsule robots are promising tools for minimally invasive diagnostics and therapy, with applications from gastrointestinal endoscopy to targeted drug delivery and biopsy sampling. Conventional magnetic capsule robots embed bulky permanent magnets at both ends, reducing the usable cavity by about 10-20 mm and limiting integration of functional modules. We propose a compact, 3D-printed soft capsule robot with a magnetic coating that replaces internal magnets, enabling locomotion via a thin, functional shell while preserving the entire interior cavity as a continuous volume for medical payloads. The compliant silicone-magnetic composite also improves swallowability, even with a slightly larger capsule size. Magnetostatic simulations and experiments confirm that programmed NSSN/SNNS pole distributions provide strong anisotropy and reliable torque generation, enabling stable bidirectional rolling, omnidirectional steering, climbing on 7.5 degree inclines, and traversal of 5 mm protrusions. Rolling motion is sustained when the magnetic field at the capsule reaches at least 0.3 mT, corresponding to an effective actuation depth of 30 mm in our setup. Future work will optimize material composition, coating thickness, and magnetic layouts to enhance force output and durability, while next-generation robotic-arm-based field generators with closed-loop feedback will address nonlinearities and expand maneuverability. Together, these advances aim to transition coating-based capsule robots toward reliable clinical deployment and broaden their applications in minimally invasive diagnostics and therapy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of informative path planning algorithms suffers from fragmented execution pipelines and poor transferability between simulation and real-world deployment.

Method: Introduces a unified architecture that decouples high-level decision-making from vehicle-specific control, with standardized interfaces between planning, sensing, and execution. Built on ROS2, MAVLink, and MQTT.

Result: GuadalPlanner enables consistent algorithm evaluation across different abstraction levels without modification, supporting discrete graph-based environments and interchangeable planning strategies.

Conclusion: The architecture successfully bridges simulation-to-reality gap, validated through real-world deployment on an autonomous surface vehicle for water quality monitoring with real-time sensor feedback.

Abstract: The evaluation of informative path planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles is often hindered by fragmented execution pipelines and limited transferability between simulation and real-world deployment. This paper introduces a unified architecture that decouples high-level decision-making from vehicle-specific control, enabling algorithms to be evaluated consistently across different abstraction levels without modification. The proposed architecture is realized through GuadalPlanner, which defines standardized interfaces between planning, sensing, and vehicle execution. It is an open and extensible research tool that supports discrete graph-based environments and interchangeable planning strategies, and is built upon widely adopted robotics technologies, including ROS2, MAVLink, and MQTT. Its design allows the same algorithmic logic to be deployed in fully simulated environments, software-in-the-loop configurations, and physical autonomous vehicles using an identical execution pipeline. The approach is validated through a set of experiments, including real-world deployment on an autonomous surface vehicle performing water quality monitoring with real-time sensor feedback.

### [275] [Omnidirectional Dual-Arm Aerial Manipulator with Proprioceptive Contact Localization for Landing on Slanted Roofs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10703)
*Martijn B. J. Brummelhuis,Nathan F. Lepora,Salua Hamaza*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A dual-arm aerial manipulator uses proprioceptive contact detection to blindly estimate roof inclination through physical interaction, enabling reliable landings on slanted surfaces up to 30.5 degrees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision/acoustic methods for detecting roof inclination in urban drone operations are unreliable due to weather and surface material influences, creating a need for more robust landing solutions.

Method: Developed a novel dual-arm aerial manipulator with omnidirectional 3D workspace, using momentum-based torque observer for proprioceptive contact detection and localization to infer surface inclination through physical interaction.

Result: Successfully demonstrated robust landings on surfaces up to 30.5° inclination, achieving average inclination estimation error of 2.87° across 9 experiments at different angles.

Conclusion: The proposed proprioceptive approach enables reliable blind estimation of surface inclination, overcoming limitations of conventional sensing methods for urban drone rooftop landings.

Abstract: Operating drones in urban environments often means they need to land on rooftops, which can have different geometries and surface irregularities. Accurately detecting roof inclination using conventional sensing methods, such as vision-based or acoustic techniques, can be unreliable, as measurement quality is strongly influenced by external factors including weather conditions and surface materials. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unmanned aerial manipulator morphology featuring a dual-arm aerial manipulator with an omnidirectional 3D workspace and extended reach. Building on this design, we develop a proprioceptive contact detection and contact localization strategy based on a momentum-based torque observer. This enables the UAM to infer the inclination of slanted surfaces blindly - through physical interaction - prior to touchdown. We validate the approach in flight experiments, demonstrating robust landings on surfaces with inclinations of up to 30.5 degrees and achieving an average surface inclination estimation error of 2.87 degrees over 9 experiments at different incline angles.

### [276] [Digging for Data: Experiments in Rock Pile Characterization Using Only Proprioceptive Sensing in Excavation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11082)
*Unal Artan,Martin Magnusson,Joshua A. Marshall*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel method for estimating relative rock particle size in mining piles using only proprioceptive data from wheel loader excavation, without external sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for characterizing fragmented rock piles in mining/quarrying rely on exteroceptive sensors (cameras/LiDAR) which can be expensive and complex. There's a need for simpler, more robust methods using only machine proprioceptive data.

Method: Uses wavelet analysis on inertial response data collected during wheel loader excavation to construct features proportional to rock fragmentation level. The ratio of wavelet features from different rock piles approximates the ratio of mean particle sizes.

Result: Extensive field experiments with an 18-tonne battery electric LHD machine in an operating quarry show the method can estimate relative particle size. Results are validated against both vision-based fragmentation analysis and physical sieving of sampled materials.

Conclusion: Proprioceptive sensing using wavelet analysis of excavation inertial response provides a viable alternative to exteroceptive sensors for estimating relative rock fragmentation, offering a simpler, potentially more robust solution for mining applications.

Abstract: Characterization of fragmented rock piles is a fundamental task in the mining and quarrying industries, where rock is fragmented by blasting, transported using wheel loaders, and then sent for further processing. This field report studies a novel method for estimating the relative particle size of fragmented rock piles from only proprioceptive data collected while digging with a wheel loader. Rather than employ exteroceptive sensors (e.g., cameras or LiDAR sensors) to estimate rock particle sizes, the studied method infers rock fragmentation from an excavator's inertial response during excavation. This paper expands on research that postulated the use of wavelet analysis to construct a unique feature that is proportional to the level of rock fragmentation. We demonstrate through extensive field experiments that the ratio of wavelet features, constructed from data obtained by excavating in different rock piles with different size distributions, approximates the ratio of the mean particle size of the two rock piles. Full-scale excavation experiments were performed with a battery electric, 18-tonne capacity, load-haul-dump (LHD) machine in representative conditions in an operating quarry. The relative particle size estimates generated with the proposed sensing methodology are compared with those obtained from both a vision-based fragmentation analysis tool and from sieving of sampled materials.

*Songen Gu,Yunuo Cai,Tianyu Wang,Simo Wu,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework for predictive video-conditioned robotic action that generates accurate future state predictions to improve manipulation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic manipulation systems lack predictive capabilities, leading to errors and inefficiency. While VLMs provide high-level guidance, they can't forecast future states, and existing world models have limitations in prediction horizons and spatial consistency.

Method: Three-step approach: 1) Select and adapt a robust video generation model for reliable future predictions, 2) Apply adversarial distillation for fast, few-step video generation, 3) Train an action model that uses both generated videos and real observations to correct spatial errors.

Result: Produces temporally coherent, spatially accurate video predictions that support precise manipulation, achieving significant improvements in embodiment consistency, spatial referring ability, and task completion over existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables predictive video-conditioned action for robotic manipulation, addressing key limitations of current systems and demonstrating superior performance through accurate future state forecasting.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation requires anticipating how the environment evolves in response to actions, yet most existing systems lack this predictive capability, often resulting in errors and inefficiency. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide high-level guidance, they cannot explicitly forecast future states, and existing world models either predict only short horizons or produce spatially inconsistent frames. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for fast and predictive video-conditioned action. Our approach first selects and adapts a robust video generation model to ensure reliable future predictions, then applies adversarial distillation for fast, few-step video generation, and finally trains an action model that leverages both generated videos and real observations to correct spatial errors. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally coherent, spatially accurate video predictions that directly support precise manipulation, achieving significant improvements in embodiment consistency, spatial referring ability, and task completion over existing baselines. Codes & Models will be released.

### [278] [From Representational Complementarity to Dual Systems: Synergizing VLM and Vision-Only Backbones for End-to-End Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10719)
*Sining Ang,Yuguang Yang,Chenxu Dang,Canyu Chen,Cheng Chi,Haiyan Liu,Xuanyao Mao,Jason Bao,Xuliang,Bingchuan Sun,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Vision-Language-Action (VLA) driving systems, showing that VLM backbones create unique behavioral subspaces compared to vision-only backbones, leading to different driving behaviors in long-tail scenarios. The authors propose hybrid systems that combine both approaches to achieve better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what changes beyond the usual accuracy-cost trade-off when augmenting end-to-end driving planning with language-enabled backbones, and to determine how VLM backbones differ from vision-only backbones in driving behavior.

Method: The authors use 3-RQ analysis in RecogDrive system with identical diffusion Transformer planner, comparing full VLM and vision-only backbones. They analyze behavioral differences, propose HybridDriveVLA (running both branches with learned scorer), and DualDriveVLA (fast-slow policy using ViT by default and invoking VLM only when needed).

Result: VLM introduces additional subspaces beyond vision-only backbones, leading to different behaviors: VLM tends to be more aggressive while ViT is more conservative. Oracle selection achieves 93.58 PDMS, HybridDriveVLA achieves 92.10 PDMS, and DualDriveVLA achieves 91.00 PDMS with 3.2x throughput improvement by calling VLM on only 15% of scenarios.

Conclusion: VLM backbones create unique behavioral subspaces that complement vision-only approaches in driving systems. Hybrid systems that intelligently combine both approaches can achieve better performance and efficiency, with practical fast-slow policies offering significant throughput improvements while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) driving augments end-to-end (E2E) planning with language-enabled backbones, yet it remains unclear what changes beyond the usual accuracy--cost trade-off. We revisit this question with 3--RQ analysis in RecogDrive by instantiating the system with a full VLM and vision-only backbones, all under an identical diffusion Transformer planner. RQ1: At the backbone level, the VLM can introduce additional subspaces upon the vision-only backbones. RQ2: This unique subspace leads to a different behavioral in some long-tail scenario: the VLM tends to be more aggressive whereas ViT is more conservative, and each decisively wins on about 2--3% of test scenarios; With an oracle that selects, per scenario, the better trajectory between the VLM and ViT branches, we obtain an upper bound of 93.58 PDMS. RQ3: To fully harness this observation, we propose HybridDriveVLA, which runs both ViT and VLM branches and selects between their endpoint trajectories using a learned scorer, improving PDMS to 92.10. Finally, DualDriveVLA implements a practical fast--slow policy: it runs ViT by default and invokes the VLM only when the scorer's confidence falls below a threshold; calling the VLM on 15% of scenarios achieves 91.00 PDMS while improving throughput by 3.2x. Code will be released.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous robots face challenges navigating safely in dynamic, crowded environments despite their potential to address labor shortages and improve operational efficiency. Current navigation systems struggle with adapting to dynamic crowd movements.

Method: The framework integrates Vision-Language Models (VLM) to recognize abstract environmental concepts like crowd densities, and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to represent these concepts probabilistically, creating dynamic "Abstraction Maps" for navigation.

Conclusion: The proposed VLM-GPR integration effectively addresses the challenge of navigating in crowded environments by generating dynamic crowd-density maps, improving autonomous robot safety and adaptability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots offer promising solutions for labor shortages and increased operational efficiency. However, navigating safely and effectively in dynamic environments, particularly crowded areas, remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to generate dynamic crowd-density maps (``Abstraction Maps'') for autonomous robot navigation. Our approach utilizes VLM's capability to recognize abstract environmental concepts, such as crowd densities, and represents them probabilistically via GPR. Experimental results from real-world trials on a university campus demonstrated that robots successfully generated routes avoiding both static obstacles and dynamic crowds, enhancing navigation safety and adaptability.

TL;DR: Maya Robot, an elephant-shaped social robot, reduces pain during cancer treatment injections and decreases children's anxiety during interactions, showing potential for pediatric healthcare support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a social robot that can support children undergoing cancer treatment by reducing pain during medical procedures and decreasing anxiety through engaging interactions.

Method: 1) Enhanced facial expression recognition using deep neural networks (98% accuracy). 2) Two experiments: a) Counterbalanced study with 25 children (4-9 years) comparing pain levels during injections with/without robot presence using paired T-tests. b) Study with 40 participants (20 children + mothers) assessing perspectives through UTAUT questionnaires after human-robot interactions and gameplay.

Result: 1) Significant reduction in perceived pain during injections when robot was present. 2) Children experienced significantly less anxiety than parents during interactions. 3) Children showed higher trust levels in both robot and games compared to parents (statistically significant, P<0.05).

Conclusion: Maya robot shows positive impact as therapy/education assistant in clinical settings, demonstrating potential for social robots to improve pain management and emotional well-being in pediatric cancer patients.

Abstract: This study centers around the design and implementation of the Maya Robot, a portable elephant-shaped social robot, intended to engage with children undergoing cancer treatment. Initial efforts were devoted to enhancing the robot's facial expression recognition accuracy, achieving a 98% accuracy through deep neural networks. Two subsequent preliminary exploratory experiments were designed to advance the study's objectives. The first experiment aimed to compare pain levels experienced by children during the injection process, with and without the presence of the Maya robot. Twenty-five children, aged 4 to 9, undergoing cancer treatment participated in this counterbalanced study. The paired T-test results revealed a significant reduction in perceived pain when the robot was actively present in the injection room. The second experiment sought to assess perspectives of hospitalized children and their mothers during engagement with Maya through a game. Forty participants, including 20 children aged 4 to 9 and their mothers, were involved. Post Human-Maya Interactions, UTAUT questionnaire results indicated that children experienced significantly less anxiety than their parents during the interaction and game play. Notably, children exhibited higher trust levels in both the robot and the games, presenting a statistically significant difference in trust levels compared to their parents (P-value < 0.05). This preliminary exploratory study highlights the positive impact of utilizing Maya as an assistant for therapy/education in a clinical setting, particularly benefiting children undergoing cancer treatment. The findings underscore the potential of social robots in pediatric healthcare contexts, emphasizing improved pain management and emotional well-being among young patients.

TL;DR: This paper develops deep learning models (LSTM and Transformers) to predict human gaze patterns in social scenarios, achieving 60-65% accuracy, and implements the best model on a Nao robot with positive user evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaze direction is crucial for social robots to understand human intent and engage effectively in multi-party interactions. Current robots lack sophisticated gaze behavior models that can adapt to various social contexts.

Method: Collected gaze data from 30 participants (15 using eye-tracker, 15 using Oculus Quest 1) watching social scenario videos. Used LSTM and Transformer models to analyze and predict gaze patterns. Implemented best model on Nao robot and evaluated with 36 new participants.

Result: Models achieved 60% accuracy for 2D animation and 65% accuracy for 3D animation in predicting gaze direction. Robot implementation received overall positive feedback, with robotics-experienced participants rating it more favorably.

Conclusion: Deep learning models can effectively predict human gaze patterns in social contexts, and implementing these on social robots improves their interaction capabilities and user satisfaction, especially for users familiar with robotics.

Abstract: During multi-party interactions, gaze direction is a key indicator of interest and intent, making it essential for social robots to direct their attention appropriately. Understanding the social context is crucial for robots to engage effectively, predict human intentions, and navigate interactions smoothly. This study aims to develop an empirical motion-time pattern for human gaze behavior in various social situations (e.g., entering, leaving, waving, talking, and pointing) using deep neural networks based on participants' data. We created two video clips-one for a computer screen and another for a virtual reality headset-depicting different social scenarios. Data were collected from 30 participants: 15 using an eye-tracker and 15 using an Oculus Quest 1 headset. Deep learning models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers, were used to analyze and predict gaze patterns. Our models achieved 60% accuracy in predicting gaze direction in a 2D animation and 65% accuracy in a 3D animation. Then, the best model was implemented onto the Nao robot; and 36 new participants evaluated its performance. The feedback indicated overall satisfaction, with those experienced in robotics rating the models more favorably.

TL;DR: First formal stability analysis for floating rigid bodies with spurious forces, providing theoretical certification for coupled aerial systems where standard force-moment decoupling fails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard geometric control relies on force-moment decoupling, which breaks down in many aerial platforms due to spurious forces induced by control moments. While experimental strategies exist for such coupled systems, there's no rigorous theoretical stability certification.

Method: Introduce a canonical model for floating rigid bodies subject to spurious forces, construct a Lyapunov-based proof establishing local exponential stability of the hovering equilibrium, and explicitly address structural challenges including induced non-minimum-phase behavior.

Result: First formal stability analysis for a generic class of floating rigid bodies with spurious forces, providing theoretical certification that standard cascade arguments cannot handle due to non-minimum-phase behavior.

Conclusion: This work fills the theoretical gap by providing rigorous stability certification for coupled aerial systems, addressing the structural challenges that prevent standard control approaches from working with spurious forces.

Abstract: Standard geometric control relies on force-moment decoupling, an assumption that breaks down in many aerial platforms due to spurious forces naturally induced by control moments. While strategies for such coupled systems have been validated experimentally, a rigorous theoretical certification of their stability is currently missing. This work fills this gap by providing the first formal stability analysis for a generic class of floating rigid bodies subject to spurious forces. We introduce a canonical model and construct a Lyapunov-based proof establishing local exponential stability of the hovering equilibrium. Crucially, the analysis explicitly addresses the structural challenges - specifically the induced non-minimum-phase behavior - that prevent the application of standard cascade arguments.

TL;DR: RADAR is a new benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in realistic physical environments, addressing shortcomings in current evaluation practices that fail to test real-world dynamics and spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA model evaluation has a significant reality gap - strong benchmark performance doesn't translate to real-world generalization. Existing benchmarks fail to model real-world dynamics, neglect spatial-physical intelligence, and lack scalable autonomous evaluation methods.

Method: RADAR introduces three core components: 1) a principled suite of physical dynamics, 2) dedicated tasks testing spatial reasoning and physical understanding, and 3) a fully autonomous evaluation pipeline using 3D metrics without human supervision.

Result: When applied to state-of-the-art VLA models, RADAR reveals severe fragility - performance drops dramatically under modest physical dynamics (3D IoU declines from 0.261 to 0.068 under sensor noise) and models show limited spatial reasoning capability.

Conclusion: RADAR serves as a necessary benchmark for reliable and generalizable real-world evaluation of VLA models, exposing the gap between simulated performance and real-world competence.

Abstract: VLA models have achieved remarkable progress in embodied intelligence; however, their evaluation remains largely confined to simulations or highly constrained real-world settings. This mismatch creates a substantial reality gap, where strong benchmark performance often masks poor generalization in diverse physical environments. We identify three systemic shortcomings in current benchmarking practices that hinder fair and reliable model comparison. (1) Existing benchmarks fail to model real-world dynamics, overlooking critical factors such as dynamic object configurations, robot initial states, lighting changes, and sensor noise. (2) Current protocols neglect spatial--physical intelligence, reducing evaluation to rote manipulation tasks that do not probe geometric reasoning. (3) The field lacks scalable fully autonomous evaluation, instead relying on simplistic 2D metrics that miss 3D spatial structure or on human-in-the-loop systems that are costly, biased, and unscalable. To address these limitations, we introduce RADAR (Real-world Autonomous Dynamics And Reasoning), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLA generalization under realistic conditions. RADAR integrates three core components: (1) a principled suite of physical dynamics; (2) dedicated tasks that explicitly test spatial reasoning and physical understanding; and (3) a fully autonomous evaluation pipeline based on 3D metrics, eliminating the need for human supervision. We apply RADAR to audit multiple state-of-the-art VLA models and uncover severe fragility beneath their apparent competence. Performance drops precipitously under modest physical dynamics, with the expectation of 3D IoU declining from 0.261 to 0.068 under sensor noise. Moreover, models exhibit limited spatial reasoning capability. These findings position RADAR as a necessary bench toward reliable and generalizable real-world evaluation of VLA models.

TL;DR: VISTA introduces a hierarchical VLA framework using world models for visual subgoal decomposition to improve generalization in robot manipulation tasks, boosting performance from 14% to 69% in novel scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models are brittle in out-of-distribution settings with limited real-robot data, creating a generalization bottleneck for robot manipulation tasks.

Method: Hierarchical framework with world model as high-level planner and VLA as low-level executor. World model decomposes tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, providing visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies.

Result: Significant performance improvement from 14% to 69% in novel scenarios with world model guidance. Outperforms previous baselines with clear margin, especially in out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach leveraging world models for visual subgoal decomposition effectively addresses generalization challenges in VLA models for robot manipulation.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are promising for generalist robot manipulation but remain brittle in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, especially with limited real-robot data. To resolve the generalization bottleneck, we introduce a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action framework \our{} that leverages the generalization of large-scale pre-trained world model for robust and generalizable VIsual Subgoal TAsk decomposition VISTA. Our hierarchical framework \our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous baselines with a clear margin, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

TL;DR: GEAR is a multi-task RL framework for MAV aerobatics that leverages SO(2) rotational symmetry through equivariant networks, achieving high success rates and real-world performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RL methods for MAV aerobatics suffer from low data efficiency and limited generalization, especially in multi-task scenarios where a single policy must master multiple maneuvers like flips, rolls, and Power Loops.

Method: GEAR is an end-to-end multi-task RL framework that explicitly incorporates SO(2) rotational symmetry into the policy architecture using an equivariant actor network, FiLM-based task modulation, and a multi-head critic.

Result: GEAR achieves 98.85% success rate across various aerobatic tasks, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Real-world experiments show stable execution of multiple maneuvers and ability to combine basic motion primitives for complex aerobatics.

Conclusion: GEAR provides a data-efficient, robust, and unified framework for aerobatic control by leveraging geometric symmetries, enabling efficient learning of diverse maneuvers with a single policy.

Abstract: Flight control for autonomous micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) is evolving from steady flight near equilibrium points toward more aggressive aerobatic maneuvers, such as flips, rolls, and Power Loop. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in these tasks, conventional RL methods often suffer from low data efficiency and limited generalization. This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-task scenarios where a single policy is required to master multiple maneuvers. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end multi-task reinforcement learning framework, called GEAR (Geometric Equivariant Aerobatics Reinforcement), which fully exploits the inherent SO(2) rotational symmetry in MAV dynamics and explicitly incorporates this property into the policy network architecture. By integrating an equivariant actor network, FiLM-based task modulation, and a multi-head critic, GEAR achieves both efficiency and flexibility in learning diverse aerobatic maneuvers, enabling a data-efficient, robust, and unified framework for aerobatic control. GEAR attains a 98.85\% success rate across various aerobatic tasks, significantly outperforming baseline methods. In real-world experiments, GEAR demonstrates stable execution of multiple maneuvers and the capability to combine basic motion primitives to complete complex aerobatics.

*Haocheng Zhao,Lukas Brunke,Oliver Lagerquist,Siqi Zhou,Angela P. Schoellig*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses safety filtering for robots using superquadric geometric representations, identifying gradient issues with implicit functions and proposing a signed distance function approach with GJK algorithm and randomized smoothing for reliable collision avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety filtering methods using control barrier functions depend on geometric representations, often simplified leading to either overly conservative behavior or insufficient collision coverage. Superquadrics offer expressive modeling but existing approaches using implicit functions have critical gradient issues that can make optimization infeasible and undermine real-time safety.

Method: Proposes an SQ-based safety filtering framework using signed distance functions as barrier candidates instead of implicit functions. Since analytical SDFs are unavailable for general SQs, distances are computed using the efficient Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) algorithm and gradients are obtained via randomized smoothing.

Result: Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate consistent collision-free manipulation in cluttered and unstructured scenes. The approach shows robustness to challenging geometries, sensing noise, and dynamic disturbances, while improving task efficiency in teleoperation tasks.

Conclusion: The work highlights a pathway toward safety filters that remain precise and reliable under the geometric complexity of real-world environments, addressing a critical gradient issue in existing superquadric-based safety filtering approaches.

Abstract: Ensuring safe robot operation in cluttered and dynamic environments remains a fundamental challenge. While control barrier functions provide an effective framework for real-time safety filtering, their performance critically depends on the underlying geometric representation, which is often simplified, leading to either overly conservative behavior or insufficient collision coverage. Superquadrics offer an expressive way to model complex shapes using a few primitives and are increasingly used for robot safety. To integrate this representation into collision avoidance, most existing approaches directly use their implicit functions as barrier candidates. However, we identify a critical but overlooked issue in this practice: the gradients of the implicit SQ function can become severely ill-conditioned, potentially rendering the optimization infeasible and undermining reliable real-time safety filtering. To address this issue, we formulate an SQ-based safety filtering framework that uses signed distance functions as barrier candidates. Since analytical SDFs are unavailable for general SQs, we compute distances using the efficient Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm and obtain gradients via randomized smoothing. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate consistent collision-free manipulation in cluttered and unstructured scenes, showing robustness to challenging geometries, sensing noise, and dynamic disturbances, while improving task efficiency in teleoperation tasks. These results highlight a pathway toward safety filters that remain precise and reliable under the geometric complexity of real-world environments.

TL;DR: RISE is a scalable robotic RL framework that uses imagination with a compositional world model to improve policy without physical interaction, achieving significant performance gains in contact-rich manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models remain brittle in contact-rich and dynamic manipulation tasks where minor execution deviations cause failures. On-policy RL in the physical world is constrained by safety risks, hardware costs, and environment reset requirements.

Method: RISE uses a Compositional World Model with: (1) a controllable dynamics model that predicts multi-view futures, and (2) a progress value model that evaluates imagined outcomes to produce informative advantages for policy improvement. This forms a closed-loop self-improving pipeline that generates imaginary rollouts, estimates advantages, and updates policies without physical interaction.

Result: RISE achieves significant improvements over prior methods: +35% absolute performance increase in dynamic brick sorting, +45% for backpack packing, and +35% for box closing across three challenging real-world tasks.

Conclusion: RISE successfully bridges the gap between RL robustness and physical world constraints by enabling scalable robotic reinforcement learning through imagination, demonstrating substantial performance gains in contact-rich manipulation tasks without costly physical interaction.

Abstract: Despite the sustained scaling on model capacity and data acquisition, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models remain brittle in contact-rich and dynamic manipulation tasks, where minor execution deviations can compound into failures. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled path to robustness, on-policy RL in the physical world is constrained by safety risk, hardware cost, and environment reset. To bridge this gap, we present RISE, a scalable framework of robotic reinforcement learning via imagination. At its core is a Compositional World Model that (i) predicts multi-view future via a controllable dynamics model, and (ii) evaluates imagined outcomes with a progress value model, producing informative advantages for the policy improvement. Such compositional design allows state and value to be tailored by best-suited yet distinct architectures and objectives. These components are integrated into a closed-loop self-improving pipeline that continuously generates imaginary rollouts, estimates advantages, and updates the policy in imaginary space without costly physical interaction. Across three challenging real-world tasks, RISE yields significant improvement over prior art, with more than +35% absolute performance increase in dynamic brick sorting, +45% for backpack packing, and +35% for box closing, respectively.

### [290] [A receding-horizon multi-contact motion planner for legged robots in challenging environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11113)
*Daniel S. J. Derwent,Simon Watson,Bruno V. Adorno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel receding-horizon multi-contact motion planner for legged robots that enables complex maneuvers like chimney climbing and gap crossing, featuring reactive re-planning, simultaneous contact/trajectory planning, faster computation, and improved resistance to local minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of planning complex multi-contact motions for legged robots in difficult scenarios (chimney climbing, narrow passages, large gaps) while overcoming limitations of existing approaches that require post-processing, multi-stage planning, and are prone to local minima.

Method: Receding-horizon planning approach with simultaneous contact location and whole-body trajectory planning using a quadratic-program-based posture generator. Features reactive re-planning capability and works with both short (one step) and longer (four steps) planning horizons.

Result: With short planning horizons, planner is 45-98% faster than state-of-the-art but produces less efficient motions (5% fewer to 700% more stance changes). Longer horizons increase planning time (73% faster to 400% slower) but yield higher quality motions (8% more to 47% fewer stance changes).

Conclusion: The proposed planner successfully enables complex multi-contact motions for legged robots with improved computational efficiency and planning quality, offering a flexible trade-off between speed and motion efficiency through adjustable planning horizons.

Abstract: We present a novel receding-horizon multi-contact motion planner for legged robots in challenging scenarios, able to plan motions such as chimney climbing, navigating very narrow passages or crossing large gaps. Our approach adds new capabilities to the state of the art, including the ability to reactively re-plan in response to new information, and planning contact locations and whole-body trajectories simultaneously, simplifying the implementation and removing the need for post-processing or complex multi-stage approaches. Our method is more resistant to local minima problems than other potential field based approaches, and our quadratic-program-based posture generator returns nodes more quickly than those of existing algorithms. Rigorous statistical analysis shows that, with short planning horizons (e.g., one step ahead), our planner is faster than the state-of-the-art across all scenarios tested (between 45% and 98% faster on average, depending on the scenario), while planning less efficient motions (requiring 5% fewer to 700% more stance changes on average). In all but one scenario (Chimney Walking), longer planning horizons (e.g., four steps ahead) extended the average planning times (between 73% faster and 400% slower than the state-of-the-art) but resulted in higher quality motion plans (between 8% more and 47% fewer stance changes than the state-of-the-art).

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NF-HIQL introduces normalizing flow policies in hierarchical RL to improve data efficiency and policy expressivity for long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical goal-conditioned RL suffers from poor data efficiency and limited policy expressivity, especially in offline/data-scarce settings, hindering practical adoption.

Method: Replaces unimodal Gaussian policies with expressive normalizing flow policies at both high- and low-levels, enabling tractable log-likelihood computation, efficient sampling, and multimodal behavior modeling.

Result: Outperforms prior goal-conditioned and hierarchical baselines across diverse long-horizon tasks (locomotion, ball-dribbling, multi-step manipulation), showing superior robustness with limited data.

Conclusion: NF-HIQL demonstrates the potential of flow-based architectures for scalable, data-efficient hierarchical reinforcement learning with theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements.

Abstract: Hierarchical goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (H-GCRL) provides a powerful framework for tackling complex, long-horizon tasks by decomposing them into structured subgoals. However, its practical adoption is hindered by poor data efficiency and limited policy expressivity, especially in offline or data-scarce regimes. In this work, Normalizing flow-based hierarchical implicit Q-learning (NF-HIQL), a novel framework that replaces unimodal gaussian policies with expressive normalizing flow policies at both the high- and low-levels of the hierarchy is introduced. This design enables tractable log-likelihood computation, efficient sampling, and the ability to model rich multimodal behaviors. New theoretical guarantees are derived, including explicit KL-divergence bounds for Real-valued non-volume preserving (RealNVP) policies and PAC-style sample efficiency results, showing that NF-HIQL preserves stability while improving generalization. Empirically, NF-HIQL is evaluted across diverse long-horizon tasks in locomotion, ball-dribbling, and multi-step manipulation from OGBench. NF-HIQL consistently outperforms prior goal-conditioned and hierarchical baselines, demonstrating superior robustness under limited data and highlighting the potential of flow-based architectures for scalable, data-efficient hierarchical reinforcement learning.

*Yikai Wang,Tingxuan Leng,Changyi Lin,Shiqi Liu,Shir Simon,Bingqing Chen,Jonathan Francis,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: APEX enables humanoid robots to climb platforms beyond leg length using contact-rich climbing behaviors and a ratchet progress reward, achieving zero-shot sim-to-real traversal of 0.8m platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DRL approaches for humanoid locomotion converge to jumping-like solutions that are high-impact, torque-limited, and unsafe for real-world deployment, limiting traversal to platforms within leg length.

Method: APEX composes six terrain-conditioned behaviors (climb-up/down, walking/crawling, stand-up/lie-down) using a generalized ratchet progress reward that tracks best-so-far progress and penalizes non-improving steps. Uses LiDAR-based full-body policies with dual sim-to-real perception strategy: modeling mapping artifacts during training and applying filtering/inpainting during deployment.

Result: Demonstrated zero-shot sim-to-real traversal of 0.8 meter platforms (114% of leg length) on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid, with robust adaptation to platform height and initial pose, and smooth multi-skill transitions.

Conclusion: APEX enables safe, perceptive climbing-based high-platform traversal beyond leg length through composed behaviors, ratchet progress rewards, and effective sim-to-real perception strategies.

Abstract: Humanoid locomotion has advanced rapidly with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), enabling robust feet-based traversal over uneven terrain. Yet platforms beyond leg length remain largely out of reach because current RL training paradigms often converge to jumping-like solutions that are high-impact, torque-limited, and unsafe for real-world deployment. To address this gap, we propose APEX, a system for perceptive, climbing-based high-platform traversal that composes terrain-conditioned behaviors: climb-up and climb-down at vertical edges, walking or crawling on the platform, and stand-up and lie-down for posture reconfiguration. Central to our approach is a generalized ratchet progress reward for learning contact-rich, goal-reaching maneuvers. It tracks the best-so-far task progress and penalizes non-improving steps, providing dense yet velocity-free supervision that enables efficient exploration under strong safety regularization. Based on this formulation, we train LiDAR-based full-body maneuver policies and reduce the sim-to-real perception gap through a dual strategy: modeling mapping artifacts during training and applying filtering and inpainting to elevation maps during deployment. Finally, we distill all six skills into a single policy that autonomously selects behaviors and transitions based on local geometry and commands. Experiments on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real traversal of 0.8 meter platforms (approximately 114% of leg length), with robust adaptation to platform height and initial pose, as well as smooth and stable multi-skill transitions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain deformation during neurosurgery misaligns preoperative planning images with intraoperative anatomy, creating a critical challenge for reliable image-guided surgery that requires accurate compensation methods.

Method: Comprehensive systematic literature review using PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science with predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, analyzing 41 studies on AI-based brain deformation compensation methods.

Result: AI-based deformation models show promising performance and computational efficiency, but current approaches have limitations in out-of-distribution robustness, standardized benchmarking, interpretability, and clinical readiness.

Conclusion: The review identifies research gaps and outlines opportunities for developing more robust, generalizable, and clinically translatable deformation compensation solutions for neurosurgical guidance.

Abstract: Accurate compensation of brain deformation is a critical challenge for reliable image-guided neurosurgery, as surgical manipulation and tumor resection induce tissue motion that misaligns preoperative planning images with intraoperative anatomy and longitudinal studies. In this systematic review, we synthesize recent AI-driven approaches developed between January 2020 and April 2025 for modeling and correcting brain deformation. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science, with predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria focused on computational methods applied to brain deformation compensation for neurosurgical imaging, resulting in 41 studies meeting these criteria. We provide a unified analysis of methodological strategies, including deep learning-based image registration, direct deformation field regression, synthesis-driven multimodal alignment, resection-aware architectures addressing missing correspondences, and hybrid models that integrate biomechanical priors. We also examine dataset utilization, reported evaluation metrics, validation protocols, and how uncertainty and generalization have been assessed across studies. While AI-based deformation models demonstrate promising performance and computational efficiency, current approaches exhibit limitations in out-of-distribution robustness, standardized benchmarking, interpretability, and readiness for clinical deployment. Our review highlights these gaps and outlines opportunities for future research aimed at achieving more robust, generalizable, and clinically translatable deformation compensation solutions for neurosurgical guidance. By organizing recent advances and critically evaluating evaluation practices, this work provides a comprehensive foundation for researchers and clinicians engaged in developing and applying AI-based brain deformation methods.

TL;DR: A generative framework combining VAE and diffusion models to synthesize realistic multi-class brain segmentation masks (including ischemic infarcts) for medical imaging when real annotations are scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality segmentation masks are scarce in medical imaging, especially for non-contrast CT neuroimaging, due to costly and variable manual annotation. This creates a bottleneck for medical image analysis.

Method: Combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained on segmentation masks to learn anatomical latent representations, with a diffusion model operating in this latent space to generate new samples from noise. At inference, synthetic masks are decoded from denoised latent vectors through the frozen VAE decoder, with optional binary prompt control over lesion presence.

Result: Generated masks preserve global brain anatomy, discrete tissue semantics, and realistic variability while avoiding structural artifacts common in pixel-space generative models. The framework produces anatomically realistic segmentation masks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a simple and scalable solution for anatomy-aware mask generation in data-scarce medical imaging scenarios, addressing the bottleneck of limited high-quality segmentation annotations.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality segmentation masks remains a major bottleneck for medical image analysis, particularly in non-contrast CT (NCCT) neuroimaging, where manual annotation is costly and variable. To address this limitation, we propose an anatomy-preserving generative framework for the unconditional synthesis of multi-class brain segmentation masks, including ischemic infarcts.
  The proposed approach combines a variational autoencoder trained exclusively on segmentation masks to learn an anatomical latent representation, with a diffusion model operating in this latent space to generate new samples from pure noise. At inference, synthetic masks are obtained by decoding denoised latent vectors through the frozen VAE decoder, with optional coarse control over lesion presence via a binary prompt.
  Qualitative results show that the generated masks preserve global brain anatomy, discrete tissue semantics, and realistic variability, while avoiding the structural artifacts commonly observed in pixel-space generative models. Overall, the proposed framework offers a simple and scalable solution for anatomy-aware mask generation in data-scarce medical imaging scenarios.

TL;DR: Uncertainty-aware deep learning framework for diabetic retinopathy severity grading using ordinal evidential learning with lesion-query attention and Dirichlet-based regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic retinopathy is a severe complication of diabetes that can lead to irreversible blindness. Early and reliable detection is critical, requiring automated systems that can handle the ordinal nature of disease progression while providing uncertainty estimates for clinical reliability.

Method: Combines convolutional backbone with lesion-query attention pooling and evidential Dirichlet-based ordinal regression head. Uses ordinal evidential loss with annealed regularization for calibrated confidence under domain shift.

Result: Strong cross-dataset generalization on APTOS, Messidor-2, and EyePACS datasets with competitive classification accuracy and high quadratic weighted kappa. Provides meaningful uncertainty estimates for low-confidence cases.

Conclusion: Ordinal evidential learning is a promising direction for robust and clinically reliable diabetic retinopathy grading, enabling both accurate severity prediction and principled uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistent hyperglycemia due to insufficient insulin production or impaired insulin utilization. One of its most severe complications is diabetic retinopathy (DR), a progressive retinal disease caused by microvascular damage, leading to hemorrhages, exudates, and potential vision loss. Early and reliable detection of DR is therefore critical for preventing irreversible blindness.
  In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware deep learning framework for automated DR severity grading that explicitly models the ordinal nature of disease progression. Our approach combines a convolutional backbone with lesion-query attention pooling and an evidential Dirichlet-based ordinal regression head, enabling both accurate severity prediction and principled estimation of predictive uncertainty. The model is trained using an ordinal evidential loss with annealed regularization to encourage calibrated confidence under domain shift.
  We evaluate the proposed method on a multi-domain training setup combining APTOS, Messidor-2, and a subset of EyePACS fundus datasets. Experimental results demonstrate strong cross-dataset generalization, achieving competitive classification accuracy and high quadratic weighted kappa on held-out test sets, while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates for low-confidence cases. These results suggest that ordinal evidential learning is a promising direction for robust and clinically reliable diabetic retinopathy grading.

*Jiachen Wang,Jon Tamir,Adam Bush*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes a framework to assess model misspecification in quantitative MRI using misspecified Cramér-Rao bound tests, demonstrating with arterial spin labeling that brain models are well-specified while kidney models show moderate misspecification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantitative MRI models are often confounded and difficult to validate in vivo, and model misspecification can lead to biased and inconsistent parameter estimates, necessitating a rigorous assessment framework.

Method: Uses two tests based on misspecified Cramér-Rao bound principles: (1) examining whether empirical MCRB asymptotically approaches CRB with repeated measurements, and (2) comparing MLE estimates from equal-sized subsets to check if empirical variance aligns with theoretical CRB predictions.

Result: The commonly used arterial spin labeling signal model appears to be well-specified in the brain but moderately misspecified in the kidney, demonstrating the framework's practical utility.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a general, theoretically grounded approach for assessing model validity in quantitative MRI, addressing a critical need for model validation in medical imaging.

Abstract: Quantitative MRI (qMRI) involves parameter estimation governed by an explicit signal model. However, these models are often confounded and difficult to validate in vivo. A model is misspecified when the assumed signal model differs from the true data-generating process. Under misspecification, the variance of any unbiased estimator is lower-bounded by the misspecified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB), and maximum-likelihood estimates (MLE) may exhibit bias and inconsistency. Based on these principles, we assess misspecification in qMRI using two tests: (i) examining whether empirical MCRB asymptotically approaches the CRB as repeated measurements increase; (ii) comparing MLE estimates from two equal-sized subsets and evaluating whether their empirical variance aligns with theoretical CRB predictions. We demonstrate the framework using arterial spin labeling (ASL) as an illustrative example. Our result shows the commonly used ASL signal model appears to be specified in the brain and moderately misspecified in the kidney. The proposed framework offers a general, theoretically grounded approach for assessing model validity in quantitative MRI.

*Jineel H Raythatha,Shuchang Ye,Jeremy Hsu,Jinman Kim*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Foundation models for traumatic bowel injury detection show equivalent AUC to task-specific models but suffer specificity deficits due to negative-class heterogeneity, not just class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate foundation models under compound distribution shift (class imbalance + heterogeneous imaging appearances) for traumatic bowel injury, a rare but high-mortality diagnosis, and investigate whether specificity deficits are associated with negative-class heterogeneity.

Method: Retrospective study using RSNA Abdominal Traumatic Injury CT dataset (23 centers, 2019-2023). Compared two foundation models (MedCLIP zero-shot, RadDINO linear probe) against three task-specific models (CNN, Transformer, Ensemble). Trained on 3,147 patients (2.3% bowel injury prevalence), evaluated on enriched 100-patient test set. Assessed specificity in patients without bowel injury: those with concurrent solid organ injury (n=58) vs no abdominal pathology (n=50).

Result: Foundation models achieved equivalent discrimination (AUC 0.64-0.68 vs 0.58-0.64) with higher sensitivity (79-91% vs 41-74%) but lower specificity (33-50% vs 50-88%). All models had high specificity without abdominal pathology (84-100%). With solid organ injuries present, foundation models showed substantial specificity decline (50-51 percentage points) vs smaller reductions (12-41 percentage points) for task-specific models.

Conclusion: Foundation models matched task-specific discrimination without task-specific training, but their specificity deficits were driven primarily by confounding negative-class heterogeneity rather than prevalence alone. Susceptibility to negative-class heterogeneity decreased with labeled training, suggesting adaptation is required before clinical implementation.

Abstract: Purpose: Translating foundation models into clinical practice requires evaluating their performance under compound distribution shift, where severe class imbalance coexists with heterogeneous imaging appearances. This challenge is relevant for traumatic bowel injury, a rare but high-mortality diagnosis. We investigated whether specificity deficits in foundation models are associated with heterogeneity in the negative class. Methods: This retrospective study used the multi-institutional, RSNA Abdominal Traumatic Injury CT dataset (2019-2023), comprising scans from 23 centres. Two foundation models (MedCLIP, zero-shot; RadDINO, linear probe) were compared against three task-specific approaches (CNN, Transformer, Ensemble). Models were trained on 3,147 patients (2.3% bowel injury prevalence) and evaluated on an enriched 100-patient test set. To isolate negative-class effects, specificity was assessed in patients without bowel injury who had concurrent solid organ injury (n=58) versus no abdominal pathology (n=50). Results: Foundation models achieved equivalent discrimination to task-specific models (AUC, 0.64-0.68 versus 0.58-0.64) with higher sensitivity (79-91% vs 41-74%) but lower specificity (33-50% vs 50-88%). All models demonstrated high specificity in patients without abdominal pathology (84-100%). When solid organ injuries were present, specificity declined substantially for foundation models (50-51 percentage points) compared with smaller reductions of 12-41 percentage points for task-specific models. Conclusion: Foundation models matched task-specific discrimination without task-specific training, but their specificity deficits were driven primarily by confounding negative-class heterogeneity rather than prevalence alone. Susceptibility to negative-class heterogeneity decreased progressively with labelled training, suggesting adaptation is required before clinical implementation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV-based hyperspectral imaging offers safer, faster landmine detection, but lacks standardized benchmarks. Need to evaluate both classical and learning-based methods for reliable detection, especially given sparse target pixels.

Method: Systematic benchmark of four classical algorithms (SAM, MF, ACE, CEM) and proposed lightweight Spectral Neural Network with Parametric Mish activations. Evaluation on inert PFM-1 landmines using VNIR hyperspectral dataset with pixel-level ground truth masks.

Result: ACE achieved highest ROC-AUC (0.989), but Spectral-NN outperformed all classical methods on precision-focused metrics (PR and AP). Results show ROC-AUC can be misleading due to extreme class imbalance, highlighting importance of precision evaluation.

Conclusion: Precision-focused evaluation, scene-aware benchmarking, and learning-based spectral models are essential for reliable UAV-based hyperspectral landmine detection. Neural networks show superior performance for practical applications despite classical methods' high ROC-AUC.

Abstract: In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with imaging sensors and automated processing algorithms have emerged as a promising tool to accelerate large-area surveys while reducing risk to human operators. Although hyperspectral imaging (HSI) enables material discrimination using spectral signatures, standardized benchmarks for UAV-based landmine detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a systematic benchmark of four classical statistical detection algorithms, including Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Matched Filter (MF), Adaptive Cosine Estimator (ACE), and Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM), alongside a proposed lightweight Spectral Neural Network utilizing Parametric Mish activations for PFM-1 landmine detection. We also release pixel-level binary ground truth masks (target/background) to enable standardized, reproducible evaluation. Evaluations were conducted on inert PFM-1 targets across multiple scene crops using a recently released VNIR hyperspectral dataset. Metrics such as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), precision-recall (PR) curve, and average precision (AP) were used. While all methods achieve high ROC-AUC on an independent test set, the ACE method observes the highest AUC of 0.989. However, because target pixels are extremely sparse relative to background, ROC-AUC alone can be misleading; under precision-focused evaluation (PR and AP), the Spectral-NN outperforms classical detectors, achieving the highest AP. These results emphasize the need for precision-focused evaluation, scene-aware benchmarking, and learning-based spectral models for reliable UAV-based hyperspectral landmine detection. The code and pixel-level annotations will be released.

TL;DR: FPGA implementation of polynomial spline compression for SPAD arrays achieves 512x compression ratio, enabling histogram-free online depth reconstruction and solving data transfer bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the massive data transfer bandwidth challenge in high-resolution SPAD arrays where data rates reach tens of GB/s, solving the time-stamp transfer bottleneck.

Method: Optimize polynomial spline function-based compression algorithm in software using fixed-point arithmetic and LUTs, then implement online sketch processing elements (SPEs) on FPGA to directly process SPAD time-stamp streams.

Result: Achieves 512x compression ratio compared to conventional histogram-based outputs, validated with 192x128-pixel SPAD array in customized LiDAR setup, enabling histogram-free online depth reconstruction with high fidelity.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective solution to SPAD array data transfer bottleneck with scalable FPGA implementation that can accommodate increasing pixel counts in future SPAD sensors.

Abstract: This study presents an efficient field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of a polynomial spline function-based statistical compression algorithm designed to address the critical challenge of massive data transfer bandwidth in emerging high-spatial-resolution single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays, where data rates can reach tens of gigabytes per second. In our experiments, the proposed hardware implementation achieves a compression ratio of 512x compared with conventional histogram-based outputs, with the potential for further improvement. The algorithm is first optimized in software using fixed-point (FXP) arithmetic and look-up tables (LUTs) to eliminate explicit additions, multiplications, and non-linear operations. This enables a careful balance between accuracy and hardware resource utilization. Guided by this trade-off analysis, online sketch processing elements (SPEs) are implemented on an FPGA to directly process time-stamp streams from the SPAD sensor. The implementation is validated using a customized LiDAR setup with a 192 x 128-pixel SPAD array. This work demonstrates histogram-free online depth reconstruction with high fidelity, effectively alleviating the time-stamp transfer bottleneck of SPAD arrays and offering scalability as pixel counts continue to increase for future SPADs.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel retinal implant stimulus encoding method using constrained sparse least-squares optimization under a linearized perceptual model, achieving significant improvements in reconstruction fidelity over traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retinal implants suffer from low resolution electrode arrays and patient-specific perceptual distortions. Traditional encoders use task-agnostic downsampling and linear brightness mappings that are suboptimal under realistic perceptual models, while neural network approaches require training and have limited generalizability.

Method: Formulates stimulus encoding as a constrained sparse least-squares problem under a linearized perceptual forward model. Exploits the sparsity of the perception matrix (which varies by patient and implant configuration) using an efficient projected residual norm steepest descent solver that supports stimulus bounds via projection.

Result: In silico experiments across four simulated patients and implant resolutions (15×15 to 100×100 electrodes) show substantial improvements: up to +0.265 SSIM increase, +12.4 dB PSNR, and 81.4% MAE reduction on Fashion-MNIST compared to Lanczos downsampling.

Conclusion: The proposed sparse least-squares optimization approach for retinal implant stimulus encoding significantly outperforms traditional methods in reconstruction fidelity while being computationally efficient and not requiring training, making it more generalizable to arbitrary inputs.

Abstract: Retinal implants aim to restore functional vision despite photoreceptor degeneration, yet are fundamentally constrained by low resolution electrode arrays and patient-specific perceptual distortions. Most deployed encoders rely on task-agnostic downsampling and linear brightness-to-amplitude mappings, which are suboptimal under realistic perceptual models. While global inverse problems have been formulated as neural networks, such approaches can be fast at inference, and can achieve high reconstruction fidelity, but require training and have limited generalizability to arbitrary inputs. We cast stimulus encoding as a constrained sparse least-squares problem under a linearized perceptual forward model. Our key observation is that the resulting perception matrix can be highly sparse, depending on patient and implant configuration. Building on this, we apply an efficient projected residual norm steepest descent solver that exploits sparsity and supports stimulus bounds via projection. In silico experiments across four simulated patients and implant resolutions from $15\times15$ to $100\times100$ electrodes demonstrate improved reconstruction fidelity, with up to $+0.265$ SSIM increase, $+12.4\,\mathrm{dB}$ PSNR, and $81.4\%$ MAE reduction on Fashion-MNIST compared to Lanczos downsampling.
