### [1] [PHANTOM: PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing Connected Vehicle Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19711)
*Md Nahid Hasan Shuvo,Moinul Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHANTOM is a novel physical adversarial attack framework for connected autonomous vehicles that uses anamorphic art to create perspective-dependent adversarial examples that fool object detectors while appearing natural to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAVs rely on vision-based DNNs and V2X communication but remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. Current attacks often require model access or lack transferability across different detector architectures.

Method: PHANTOM uses anamorphic art techniques to craft perspective-dependent adversarial examples that exploit geometric distortions. The framework operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates transferability across four object detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet).

Result: PHANTOM achieves over 90% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80% effectiveness in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. In network simulations, it triggers false emergency messages that increase Peak Age of Information by 68-89% and degrade safety-critical communication.

Conclusion: PHANTOM exposes critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems, demonstrating that anamorphic adversarial attacks can effectively disrupt connected vehicle systems while appearing natural to human observers.

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) rely on vision-based deep neural networks (DNNs) and low-latency (Vehicle-to-Everything) V2X communication to navigate safely and efficiently. Despite their advances, these systems remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet). Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\% and degrading safety-critical communication. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems.

### [2] [Generating the Past, Present and Future from a Motion-Blurred Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19817)
*SaiKiran Tedla,Kelly Zhu,Trevor Canham,Felix Taubner,Michael S. Brown,Kiriakos N. Kutulakos,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new technique that uses pre-trained video diffusion models to recover complex scene dynamics from motion-blurred images, revealing what happened before, during, and after image capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur encodes valuable information about scene and camera motion during exposure, but existing methods rely on handcrafted priors and cannot recover complex scene dynamics or events before/after image capture.

Method: Repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos from motion-blurred images, revealing scene dynamics during capture and extending into past/future.

Result: Outperforms previous methods, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks like recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that motion-blurred images contain rich temporal information that can be extracted using large-scale video priors to reveal complex scene dynamics beyond just the moment of capture.

Abstract: We seek to answer the question: what can a motion-blurred image reveal about a scene's past, present, and future? Although motion blur obscures image details and degrades visual quality, it also encodes information about scene and camera motion during an exposure. Previous techniques leverage this information to estimate a sharp image from an input blurry one, or to predict a sequence of video frames showing what might have occurred at the moment of image capture. However, they rely on handcrafted priors or network architectures to resolve ambiguities in this inverse problem, and do not incorporate image and video priors on large-scale datasets. As such, existing methods struggle to reproduce complex scene dynamics and do not attempt to recover what occurred before or after an image was taken. Here, we introduce a new technique that repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos revealing complex scene dynamics during the moment of capture and what might have occurred immediately into the past or future. Our approach is robust and versatile; it outperforms previous methods for this task, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks such as recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

*SaiKiran Tedla,Zhoutong Zhang,Xuaner Zhang,Shumian Xin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models that generates focal stacks from single defocused images, enabling interactive focus adjustment after capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autofocus systems often fail to capture intended subjects, and users frequently want to adjust focus after taking photos, creating a need for post-capture refocusing capabilities.

Method: Uses video diffusion models to generate perceptually accurate focal stacks (represented as video sequences) from single defocused images, enabling interactive refocusing.

Result: Method consistently outperforms existing approaches in perceptual quality and robustness across challenging scenarios, with a large-scale focal stack dataset released for research.

Conclusion: This approach paves the way for advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography, with code and data publicly available.

Abstract: Focus is a cornerstone of photography, yet autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture. We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From a single defocused image, our approach generates a perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as a video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking a range of downstream applications. We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both perceptual quality and robustness across challenging scenarios, paving the way for more advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography.

### [4] [RANSAC Scoring Functions: Analysis and Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19850)
*A. Shekhovtsov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper revisits scoring functions for geometric model fitting, shows MAGSAC++ is equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform model, and finds all scoring functions perform similarly in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically analyze and improve scoring functions for robust geometric model fitting, particularly examining the state-of-the-art MAGSAC++ method and establishing proper evaluation methodology.

Method: Extends geometric error to spherical noises, analyzes mixture models with uniform outliers, provides unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators, and proposes experimental methodology with validation sets.

Result: MAGSAC++ derivation lacks sound principles and is numerically equivalent to simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood; all scoring functions perform identically in experiments, including learned distributions.

Conclusion: Comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis reveals limitations in current scoring function research, with MAGSAC++ offering no advantage over simpler methods and all approaches performing similarly.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of assigning a score (a quality of fit) to candidate geometric models -- one of the key components of RANSAC for robust geometric fitting. In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.
  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.
  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.
  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.

### [5] [HyGE-Occ: Hybrid View-Transformation with 3D Gaussian and Edge Priors for 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19871)
*Jong Wook Kim,Wonseok Roh,Ha Dam Baek,Pilhyeon Lee,Jonghyun Choi,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyGE-Occ is a novel framework for 3D panoptic occupancy prediction that uses hybrid view-transformation with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to improve geometric consistency and boundary awareness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Occ3D-nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for 3D panoptic occupancy prediction struggle with maintaining precise geometry and capturing accurate spatial ranges of 3D instances, which is critical for robust panoptic separation in complex environments.

Method: HyGE-Occ introduces a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with discretized depth-bin formulation to produce BEV features with improved geometric consistency. It also extracts edge maps from BEV features as auxiliary information to learn edge cues for better boundary awareness.

Result: The framework outperforms existing work on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: HyGE-Occ effectively addresses geometric consistency and boundary awareness challenges in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction through its hybrid approach with Gaussian and edge priors, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction aims to reconstruct a dense volumetric scene map by predicting the semantic class and instance identity of every occupied region in 3D space. Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments. However, existing approaches often struggle to maintain precise geometry and capture the precise spatial range of 3D instances critical for robust panoptic separation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues. In our extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.

### [6] [Widget2Code: From Visual Widgets to UI Code via Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19918)
*Houston H. Zhang,Tao Zhang,Baoze Lin,Yuanqi Xue,Yincheng Zhu,Huan Liu,Li Gu,Linfeng Ye,Ziqiang Wang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang,Yuanhao Yu,Zhixiang Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UI2Code extended to widgets (Widget2Code) with new benchmark, baseline method, and infrastructure for generating executable code from widget images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces with dense layouts and iconography, but lack accessible markup and training data compared to web/mobile UIs. Existing UI2Code methods underperform on widgets.

Method: Proposes Widget2Code framework with: 1) Perceptual understanding using widget design principles to assemble atomic components with icon retrieval, 2) WidgetFactory infrastructure with framework-agnostic WidgetDSL and compiler for multiple front-end implementations, 3) Adaptive rendering for spatial refinement.

Result: Establishes new widget benchmark with fine-grained metrics. Shows MLLMs outperform specialized UI2Code methods but still produce unreliable code. Proposed baseline substantially enhances visual fidelity and provides unified infrastructure.

Conclusion: Widget2Code addresses unique challenges of widget code generation, providing strong baseline and infrastructure for future research on compact, context-free micro-interfaces.

Abstract: User interface to code (UI2Code) aims to generate executable code that can faithfully reconstruct a given input UI. Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.

*S. Mazdak Abulnaga,Andrew Hoopes,Malte Hoffmann,Robin Magnet,Maks Ovsjanikov,Lilla Zöllei,John Guttag,Bruce Fischl,Adrian Dalca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeurAlign is a deep learning framework that jointly registers 3D brain MRI scans by aligning both cortical surfaces and subcortical volumes through a unified representation, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional brain MRI registration methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, leading to inconsistencies that limit downstream neuroscientific analyses. There's a need for a unified approach that ensures anatomical consistency between cortical and subcortical regions.

Method: NeurAlign uses a deep learning framework with an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy. It integrates spherical registration into learning to ensure geometric coherence between volume and surface domains, requiring only an MRI scan as input.

Result: NeurAlign consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods, improving Dice scores by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. It's orders of magnitude faster than standard methods and simpler to use with no additional inputs beyond MRI scans.

Conclusion: NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration with superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, enabling more consistent and anatomically accurate brain MRI alignment for neuroscientific studies.

Abstract: Accurate registration of brain MRI scans is fundamental for cross-subject analysis in neuroscientific studies. This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. With its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.

### [8] [Vehicle-centric Perception via Multimodal Structured Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19934)
*Wentao Wu,Xiao Wang,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VehicleMAE-V2 is a vehicle-centric pre-trained large model that uses multimodal structured priors (symmetry, contour, semantics) to enhance masked token reconstruction for better vehicle perception representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations needed for intelligent systems like surveillance, transportation, and autonomous driving.

Method: Proposes VehicleMAE-V2 with three modules: Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM) uses vehicle symmetry constraints to select high-quality masked patches; Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) preserves holistic vehicle structure through probability distribution alignment; Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) aligns image-text features via contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation. Also constructs Autobot4M dataset with 4M vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions.

Result: Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate superior performance of VehicleMAE-V2 compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: VehicleMAE-V2 effectively incorporates vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to enhance masked token reconstruction, enabling better learning of generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception tasks.

Abstract: Vehicle-centric perception plays a crucial role in many intelligent systems, including large-scale surveillance systems, intelligent transportation, and autonomous driving. Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations. To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VehicleMAE-V2.

### [9] [Progressive Learned Image Compression for Machine Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20070)
*Jungwoo Kim,Jun-Hyuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICM-Net: Progressive learned image compression for machine perception using trit-plane coding with adaptive decoding control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While learned image codecs have been extended from human to machine perception, progressive compression with fine granular scalability remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. There's a need for efficient progressive transmission that maintains machine task performance.

Method: Proposed PICM-Net based on trit-plane coding, systematically analyzing differences between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities. Includes adaptive decoding controller that dynamically determines necessary decoding level during inference to maintain desired confidence in downstream machine prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in downstream classification tasks.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression that enables efficient progressive transmission for machine perception applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in learned image codecs have been extended from human perception toward machine perception. However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.

### [10] [Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19941)
*Mozes Jacobs,Thomas Fel,Richard Hakim,Alessandra Brondetta,Demba Ba,T. Andy Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers exhibit block-recurrent depth structure where computation can be accurately approximated using far fewer distinct blocks applied recurrently, enabling dynamical systems analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a mechanistic account of Vision Transformers' computational phenomenology and interpret Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow, since despite architectural cues suggesting dynamical structure, there's no settled framework for this interpretation.

Method: Introduce Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH) and train block-recurrent surrogates called Raptor (Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers) to test whether ViTs admit block-recurrent depth structure. Analyze between-layer representational similarity matrices and train recurrent approximations to pretrained ViTs.

Result: ViTs show few contiguous phases in depth, stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure, and Raptor models recover 96% of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k accuracy with only 2 blocks. Dynamical interpretability reveals directional convergence, token-specific dynamics, and low-rank updates in late depth.

Conclusion: A compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.

Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.

*Alireza Moayedikia,Sattar Dorafshan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection, featuring uncertainty quantification and cross-modal attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated inspection of deteriorating civil infrastructure is needed to overcome limitations of visual assessment. Single modal approaches (Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography) face complementary constraints: radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth.

Method: Multi-modal attention network with temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross-modal fusion with learnable embeddings to discover complementary defect patterns. Incorporates uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components.

Result: On five bridge datasets with balanced to moderately imbalanced data, the approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC, representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation-based fusion. Cross-modal attention provides critical gains beyond within-modality attention, while multi-head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error and enables selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases.

Conclusion: Attention-based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, but extreme class imbalance requires specialized techniques due to vulnerability to majority class collapse. The system maintains deployment efficiency for real-time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: Deteriorating civil infrastructure requires automated inspection techniques overcoming limitations of visual assessment. While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. Our system maintains deployment efficiency, enabling real time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.

*Haoyi Zhong,Fang-Lue Zhang,Andrew Chalmers,Taehyun Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SE360: A novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360° panoramas using autonomous data generation and transformer-based diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-based image editing methods produce implausible results when applied to 360° panoramas in both equirectangular projections and perspective views, creating a need for specialized solutions for panoramic editing.

Method: 1) Coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline using Vision-Language Model and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis; 2) Two-stage data refinement strategy to improve realism and reduce overfitting; 3) Transformer-based diffusion model trained on the constructed dataset for flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in both visual quality and semantic accuracy for 360° panorama editing tasks.

Conclusion: SE360 provides an effective solution for multi-condition guided object editing in 360° panoramas through autonomous data generation and specialized training, addressing the unique challenges of panoramic image editing.

Abstract: While instruction-based image editing is emerging, extending it to 360$^\circ$ panoramas introduces additional challenges. Existing methods often produce implausible results in both equirectangular projections (ERP) and perspective views. To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy.

### [13] [Generative Latent Coding for Ultra-Low Bitrate Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20194)
*Zhaoyang Jia,Jiahao Li,Bin Li,Houqiang Li,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLC is a generative latent coding architecture that performs compression in VQ-VAE latent space instead of pixel space, achieving high realism and fidelity at ultra-low bitrates (<0.04 bpp).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pixel-space compression struggles to achieve both high realism and high fidelity at low bitrates because pixel-space distortion doesn't align well with human perception. Transform coding in pixel space has limitations for perceptual quality.

Method: Uses VQ-VAE generative latent space for transform coding instead of pixel space. Introduces categorical hyper module to reduce hyper-information bit cost, and code-prediction-based supervision for semantic consistency.

Result: Achieves <0.04 bpp on natural images and <0.01 bpp on facial images while maintaining high visual quality. On CLIC2020, matches MS-ILLM FID with 45% fewer bits. Enables applications like image restoration and style transfer.

Conclusion: Generative latent space coding provides better sparsity, semantics, and perceptual alignment than pixel-space coding, enabling high-quality compression at ultra-low bitrates with additional application capabilities.

Abstract: Most existing image compression approaches perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce its spatial redundancy. However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore, the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline, such as image restoration and style transfer. The code is available at https://github.com/jzyustc/GLC.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if global 3D understanding naturally emerges in Video Foundation Models after training on large-scale video data, and to quantify the level of 3D awareness in existing models.

Method: Proposed a model-agnostic framework that measures 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features using shallow read-outs.

Conclusion: The findings provide valuable insights into 3D understanding in VidFMs and offer benchmarking observations for building scalable 3D models.

Abstract: Videos are continuous 2D projections of 3D worlds. After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.

TL;DR: HistoWAS is a computational framework that links tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes by augmenting conventional pathology features with 30 topological/spatial features and performing mass univariate regression with statistical correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current high-throughput "pathomic" analysis of Whole Slide Images lacks tools to measure spatial interactions of tissue characteristics and their association with clinical parameters, limiting clinical relevance of tissue micro- and macro-environment analysis.

Method: HistoWAS implements: (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features adapted from Geographic Information Systems point pattern analysis to quantify tissue micro-architecture; (2) an association study engine inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction.

Result: Applied HistoWAS to analyze 102 features (72 conventional object-level features + 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project. Code and data released publicly.

Conclusion: HistoWAS provides a computational framework to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes, addressing limitations in current pathomic analysis tools and enabling biomarker discovery through spatial feature analysis.

Abstract: High-throughput "pathomic" analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offers new opportunities to study tissue characteristics and for biomarker discovery. However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The code and data have been released to https://github.com/hrlblab/histoWAS.

*Binfeng Wang,Di Wang,Haonan Guo,Ying Fu,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAMP is a unified HSI restoration framework that uses degradation metrics as prompts instead of explicit degradation priors, enabling adaptive restoration under diverse degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified HSI restoration methods rely on explicit degradation priors/labels as prompts, which are difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios with complex and mixed degradations.

Method: Proposes Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) with: 1) Spatial-spectral degradation metrics to quantify multi-dimensional degradations as Degradation Prompts (DP), 2) Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) for dynamic feature modulation, and 3) Mixture-of-Experts architecture using DP as gating router for adaptive restoration.

Result: Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations.

Conclusion: DAMP provides a practical unified HSI restoration solution that doesn't require explicit degradation priors, enabling robust performance across various degradation scenarios through metric-based prompting and adaptive feature modulation.

Abstract: Unified hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover various degraded HSIs using a single model, offering great practical value. However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

*Le Feng,Li Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WSD-MIL: A window scale decay MIL framework for computational pathology that efficiently models tumor regions at varying scales while reducing computational memory by 62%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods in computational pathology overlook complex semantic relationships among instances in WSIs. Transformer-based approaches have quadratic complexity limiting scalability, and fixed-scale attention mechanisms struggle with varying tumor region scales and distance-based decay effects of patch relevance.

Method: WSD-MIL consists of: 1) Window scale decay attention module using cluster-based sampling to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; 2) Squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module that dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing computational memory by 62%.

Conclusion: WSD-MIL effectively addresses the limitations of existing MIL methods by efficiently modeling tumor regions at varying scales with reduced computational overhead, demonstrating superior performance in computational pathology tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, the integration of pre-trained foundational models with multiple instance learning (MIL) has improved diagnostic accuracy in computational pathology. However, existing MIL methods focus on optimizing feature extractors and aggregation strategies while overlooking the complex semantic relationships among instances within whole slide image (WSI). Although Transformer-based MIL approaches aiming to model instance dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability to large-scale WSIs. Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that WSD-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing 62% of the computational memory. The code will be publicly available.

TL;DR: TAVID: A unified framework that jointly generates synchronized interactive videos (talking/listening faces) and conversational speech from text and reference images, enabling multimodal conversation synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational AI systems typically study talking/listening head generation and speech generation in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation where audio and visual cues are tightly coupled. There's a need for unified systems that can generate synchronized audio-visual interactions.

Method: TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines using two cross-modal mappers: (1) motion mapper and (2) speaker mapper, which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between audio and visual modalities for synchronized generation.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality, showing superior performance in all aspects compared to isolated approaches.

Conclusion: TAVID successfully addresses the multimodal conversation generation problem by jointly synthesizing interactive videos and conversational speech in a synchronized manner, representing an important step toward building more human-like conversational systems.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to jointly synthesize interactive videos and conversational speech from text and reference images. With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ensemble model combining CNN with Gradient Boosting Machine to detect guava diseases (Anthracnose and fruit flies) with 99.99% accuracy, using a new dataset from Bangladesh plantations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bangladesh's economy relies on guava cultivation, but diseases like Anthracnose and fruit fly infections reduce quality and productivity. Early disease detection through expert systems can minimize losses and protect harvests.

Method: Used CNN combined with traditional machine learning techniques, specifically proposing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. Applied this to the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24) containing images of healthy guava, fruit flies, and Anthracnose-infected fruits from Rajshahi and Pabna plantations.

Result: Achieved approximately 99.99% classification accuracy for guava disease detection using the proposed CNN-ML cascade framework with Gradient Boosting Machine ensemble.

Conclusion: The CNN-ML cascade framework demonstrates strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection suitable for real-time agricultural monitoring systems in Bangladesh, potentially enhancing guava production and economic development.

Abstract: As a significant agricultural country, Bangladesh utilizes its fertile land for guava cultivation and dedicated labor to boost its economic development. In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems.

*Peng Gao,Ke Li,Di Wang,Yongshan Zhu,Yiming Zhang,Xuemei Luo,Yifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDTM is a dual-branch weakly supervised framework for cross-resolution land cover mapping that decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning to address resolution mismatch challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-resolution land cover mapping suffers from severe resolution mismatch between coarse/low-resolution supervision and high-resolution predictions, causing noisy supervision and degraded accuracy in existing weakly supervised approaches.

Method: DDTM uses a dual-branch framework: 1) diffusion-based branch for progressive fine-scale local semantic refinement under coarse supervision, 2) transformer-based branch for long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents, plus a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise and selectively exploit reliable signals.

Result: DDTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on Chesapeake Bay benchmark with 66.52% mIoU, substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-branch framework effectively addresses cross-resolution mapping challenges by separating local refinement from global reasoning and incorporating noise-aware supervision, establishing new SOTA for weakly supervised land cover mapping.

Abstract: Cross-resolution land cover mapping aims to produce high-resolution semantic predictions from coarse or low-resolution supervision, yet the severe resolution mismatch makes effective learning highly challenging. Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

TL;DR: MIVA is a lightweight modular adapter system for diffusion models that enables precise motion control for image animation with minimal training data, eliminating the need for prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with image animation due to video data scarcity causing memorization over prompt compliance, and poor generalization to novel motion patterns with limited training data.

Method: Proposes Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA) - lightweight sub-networks attachable to pre-trained DMs, each capturing a single motion pattern, scalable via parallelization, trainable on ~10 samples with consumer GPU.

Result: MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining or surpassing generation quality of models trained on much larger datasets, with inference requiring only selection of MIVA modules.

Conclusion: MIVA addresses key limitations of diffusion models for image animation through modular, data-efficient adapters that provide precise motion control without prompt engineering.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved impressive photorealism in image and video generation. However, their application to image animation remains limited, even when trained on large-scale datasets. Two primary challenges contribute to this: the high dimensionality of video signals leads to a scarcity of training data, causing DMs to favor memorization over prompt compliance when generating motion; moreover, DMs struggle to generalize to novel motion patterns not present in the training set, and fine-tuning them to learn such patterns, especially using limited training data, is still under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA), a lightweight sub-network attachable to a pre-trained DM, each designed to capture a single motion pattern and scalable via parallelization. MIVAs can be efficiently trained on approximately ten samples using a single consumer-grade GPU. At inference time, users can specify motion by selecting one or multiple MIVAs, eliminating the need for prompt engineering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining, or even surpassing, the generation quality of models trained on significantly larger datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a standardized benchmark dataset for pavement defect detection that consolidates multiple public sources into a unified collection with consistent annotations, enabling fair model comparison and better generalization across diverse real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated pavement defect detection lacks generalization due to inconsistent datasets with varying annotation styles, distress type definitions, and formats across different sources, preventing unified training and fair model evaluation.

Method: Created a comprehensive benchmark dataset by consolidating multiple publicly available sources into a standardized collection with 52,747 images from 7 countries, featuring 135,277 bounding box annotations covering 13 distress types. Standardized class definitions and annotation formats across all sources.

Result: The dataset captures broad real-world variation in image quality, resolution, viewing angles, and weather conditions. Benchmarking with state-of-the-art models (YOLOv8-YOLOv12, Faster R-CNN, DETR) showed competitive performance across diverse scenarios and enabled zero-shot transfer to new environments.

Conclusion: This standardized dataset provides the first globally representative benchmark for pavement defect detection, enabling fair comparison of models and improving generalization across diverse real-world conditions through consistent training and evaluation.

Abstract: Automated pavement defect detection often struggles to generalize across diverse real-world conditions due to the lack of standardized datasets. Existing datasets differ in annotation styles, distress type definitions, and formats, limiting their integration for unified training. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark dataset that consolidates multiple publicly available sources into a standardized collection of 52747 images from seven countries, with 135277 bounding box annotations covering 13 distinct distress types. The dataset captures broad real-world variation in image quality, resolution, viewing angles, and weather conditions, offering a unique resource for consistent training and evaluation. Its effectiveness was demonstrated through benchmarking with state-of-the-art object detection models including YOLOv8-YOLOv12, Faster R-CNN, and DETR, which achieved competitive performance across diverse scenarios. By standardizing class definitions and annotation formats, this dataset provides the first globally representative benchmark for pavement defect detection and enables fair comparison of models, including zero-shot transfer to new environments.

TL;DR: LaSeRS is a large-scale dataset for complex language-guided segmentation in remote sensing, addressing hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning, and linguistic variability. SegEarth-R2 is a new MLLM architecture with spatial attention supervision and flexible segmentation queries that achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current remote sensing models fail at complex geospatial scenarios like multi-target segmentation, hierarchical object parsing, and implicit intent interpretation. Existing datasets oversimplify these challenges, leading to models that are sensitive and unreliable for real-world applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring.

Method: 1) Created LaSeRS dataset covering four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation. 2) Proposed SegEarth-R2 MLLM architecture with spatial attention supervision for small object localization and flexible segmentation query mechanism for both single and multi-target scenarios.

Result: SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for next-generation geospatial segmentation. The model effectively handles complex segmentation tasks that previous models failed at.

Conclusion: LaSeRS addresses the critical gap in complex geospatial reasoning datasets, and SegEarth-R2 provides an effective architecture for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in remote sensing, enabling more robust real-world applications.

Abstract: Effectively grounding complex language to pixels in remote sensing (RS) images is a critical challenge for applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring. Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation.

*Anthony Dontoh,Stephanie Ivey,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dual-view (driver + road) distraction detection improves accuracy only with appropriate architecture design; SlowOnly-R50 gains 9.8% with dual-view while SlowFast-R50 loses 7.2% due to representational conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing distracted driving detection models rely only on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior, limiting their effectiveness in naturalistic driving conditions.

Method: Used synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving to benchmark three spatiotemporal action recognition architectures (SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, SlowOnly-R50) under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view.

Result: Performance gains from contextual inputs depend strongly on architecture: SlowOnly-R50 achieved 9.8% improvement with dual-view inputs, while SlowFast-R50 experienced 7.2% drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. X3D-M showed mixed results.

Conclusion: Simply adding visual context is insufficient and may cause interference; architecture must be specifically designed to support multi-view integration. Future multimodal driver monitoring systems require fusion-aware design for effective distraction detection.

Abstract: Despite increasing interest in computer vision-based distracted driving detection, most existing models rely exclusively on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior. This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.

TL;DR: MAPI-GNN is a graph neural network that learns multifaceted graph profiles from disentangled feature subspaces for multimodal medical diagnosis, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph neural networks for medical diagnosis rely on single static graphs built from indiscriminate features, which limits their ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships.

Method: The framework uses a multi-dimensional discriminator to uncover latent graph-aware patterns, dynamically constructs a stack of activation graphs guided by these patterns, and aggregates them through a relational fusion engine for diagnosis.

Result: Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks with over 1300 patient samples show MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MAPI-GNN successfully reconstructs the single-graph paradigm by learning multifaceted graph profiles from semantically disentangled feature subspaces, enabling more robust medical diagnosis through better modeling of patient-specific relationships.

Abstract: Graph neural networks are increasingly applied to multimodal medical diagnosis for their inherent relational modeling capabilities. However, their efficacy is often compromised by the prevailing reliance on a single, static graph built from indiscriminate features, hindering the ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships. To this end, the proposed Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network (MAPI-GNN) reconstructs this single-graph paradigm by learning a multifaceted graph profile from semantically disentangled feature subspaces. The framework first uncovers latent graph-aware patterns via a multi-dimensional discriminator; these patterns then guide the dynamic construction of a stack of activation graphs; and this multifaceted profile is finally aggregated and contextualized by a relational fusion engine for a robust diagnosis. Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks, comprising over 1300 patient samples, demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### [26] [$\text{H}^2$em: Learning Hierarchical Hyperbolic Embeddings for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20029)
*Lin Li,Jiahui Li,Jiaming Lei,Jun Xiao,Feifei Shao,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2em introduces hyperbolic embeddings for compositional zero-shot learning, addressing limitations of Euclidean methods in modeling hierarchical structures through hyperbolic geometry with specialized losses and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CZSL methods using Euclidean space fail to effectively model hierarchical structures (semantic hierarchy of primitives and conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions), especially for large-scale taxonomies where polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match exponential hierarchical structure, impairing generalization capacity.

Method: H2em learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings using hyperbolic geometry. It includes: 1) Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss using hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce predefined hierarchies, 2) Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to create large geodesic distances between semantically similar compositions, and 3) Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention for instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry.

Result: Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios for compositional zero-shot learning.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry is better suited than Euclidean space for embedding hierarchical structures in CZSL, and the proposed H2em framework with specialized hyperbolic learning objectives effectively addresses hierarchical collapse and discrimination issues while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by generalizing from a training set of their primitives (state and object). Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released.

### [27] [VALLR-Pin: Dual-Decoding Visual Speech Recognition for Mandarin with Pinyin-Guided LLM Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20032)
*Chang Sun,Dongliang Xie,Bo Qin,Hong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VALLR-Pin: A two-stage Mandarin lip-reading framework that uses multi-task learning (characters + Pinyin) and LLM-based error correction with phonetic context to handle homophone ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mandarin visual speech recognition is challenging due to highly ambiguous visemes and prevalent homophones, requiring better approaches to handle phonetic ambiguity.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Shared video encoder with dual decoders predicting Chinese characters and Pinyin romanization via multi-task learning; 2) LLM-based refinement using Pinyin output and candidate transcripts as prompts, fine-tuned on synthetic noisy examples from intermediate checkpoints.

Result: The approach synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance by explicitly addressing homophone-induced errors.

Conclusion: VALLR-Pin effectively extends English VALLR to Mandarin by incorporating phonetic context and LLM-based error correction, creating a robust framework for handling Mandarin's unique challenges in visual speech recognition.

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition aims to transcribe spoken words from silent lip-motion videos. This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance.

### [28] [FlashLips: 100-FPS Mask-Free Latent Lip-Sync using Reconstruction Instead of Diffusion or GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20033)
*Andreas Zinonos,Michał Stypułkowski,Antoni Bigata,Stavros Petridis,Maja Pantic,Nikita Drobyshev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashLips is a real-time lip-sync system achieving 100+ FPS that decouples lips control from rendering using a two-stage approach: latent-space editing for visual reconstruction and audio-to-pose prediction for speech-driven control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a real-time lip-sync system that maintains high visual quality while achieving faster-than-real-time performance, addressing the computational limitations of larger state-of-the-art models and eliminating the need for explicit masks during inference.

Method: Two-stage approach: Stage 1 uses a compact one-step latent-space editor trained with reconstruction losses (no GANs/diffusion) that takes reference identity, masked target frame, and lips-pose vector. Self-supervision removes explicit masks by generating mouth-altered variants as pseudo ground truth. Stage 2 uses an audio-to-pose transformer with flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses from speech.

Result: Achieves real-time performance at over 100 FPS on a single GPU while matching visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models. The system combines deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control in a simple, stable pipeline.

Conclusion: FlashLips demonstrates that high-quality real-time lip-sync is achievable through a decoupled approach that separates lips control from rendering, using efficient latent-space editing and self-supervised mask-free training, offering a practical solution for real-time applications.

Abstract: We present FlashLips, a two-stage, mask-free lip-sync system that decouples lips control from rendering and achieves real-time performance running at over 100 FPS on a single GPU, while matching the visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models. Stage 1 is a compact, one-step latent-space editor that reconstructs an image using a reference identity, a masked target frame, and a low-dimensional lips-pose vector, trained purely with reconstruction losses - no GANs or diffusion. To remove explicit masks at inference, we use self-supervision: we generate mouth-altered variants of the target image, that serve as pseudo ground truth for fine-tuning, teaching the network to localize edits to the lips while preserving the rest. Stage 2 is an audio-to-pose transformer trained with a flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech. Together, these stages form a simple and stable pipeline that combines deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control, delivering high perceptual quality and faster-than-real-time speed.

*Nguyen Lam Phu Quy,Pham Phu Hoa,Tran Chi Nguyen,Dao Sy Duy Minh,Nguyen Hoang Minh Ngoc,Huynh Trung Kiet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal pipeline that enhances image captions by retrieving similar images, extracting contextual information from related articles, and integrating this knowledge with base captions to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth, omitting crucial details like event background, temporal cues, outcomes, and named entities not visually discernible. This limits effectiveness in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives where richer descriptions are essential.

Method: Multimodal pipeline that: 1) retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 and SigLIP, 2) reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, 3) extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search, and 4) integrates context with base captions (generated by Instruct BLIP) using a fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA.

Result: Evaluated on OpenEvents v1 dataset, the approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal pipeline effectively addresses the contextual gap in image captions by augmenting visual input with external textual knowledge, producing event-enriched descriptions suitable for domains like journalism, education, and digital archives.

Abstract: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth, omitting crucial details such as event background, temporal cues, outcomes, and named entities that are not visually discernible. This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding

*Jinyoung Choi,Youngchae Kwon,Injung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRSN improves fashion style classification by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations using item region pooling and gated feature fusion, achieving significant accuracy gains over baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fashion style classification is challenging due to large visual variation within styles and similarity between different styles. Styles are expressed through both global appearance and individual item attributes/combinations, requiring analysis of item-specific features beyond just global features.

Method: Propose Item Region-based Style Network (IRSN) with: 1) Item Region Pooling (IRP) to extract features from each item region, 2) Separate analysis of item-specific features, 3) Gated Feature Fusion (GFF) to combine features, and 4) Dual-backbone architecture combining domain-specific and general feature extractors pre-trained on large-scale image-text data.

Result: IRSN improved style classification accuracy by average 6.9% (max 14.5%) on FashionStyle14 and average 7.6% (max 15.1%) on ShowniqV3 across six backbones (EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, Swin Transformer, etc.). Visualization analysis shows IRSN better captures differences between similar style classes.

Conclusion: IRSN effectively classifies fashion styles by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline models. The approach successfully addresses challenges of visual variation within styles and similarity between styles.

Abstract: Fashion style classification is a challenging task because of the large visual variation within the same style and the existence of visually similar styles.
  Styles are expressed not only by the global appearance, but also by the attributes of individual items and their combinations.
  In this study, we propose an item region-based fashion style classification network (IRSN) to effectively classify fashion styles by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations in addition to global features.
  IRSN extracts features of each item region using item region pooling (IRP), analyzes them separately, and combines them using gated feature fusion (GFF).
  In addition, we improve the feature extractor by applying a dual-backbone architecture that combines a domain-specific feature extractor and a general feature extractor pre-trained with a large-scale image-text dataset.
  In experiments, applying IRSN to six widely-used backbones, including EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer, improved style classification accuracy by an average of 6.9% and a maximum of 14.5% on the FashionStyle14 dataset and by an average of 7.6% and a maximum of 15.1% on the ShowniqV3 dataset. Visualization analysis also supports that the IRSN models are better than the baseline models at capturing differences between similar style classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how different activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh) and optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, Adagrad) affect Human Activity Recognition performance using BiLSTM and ConvLSTM architectures on healthcare-relevant activity datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While deep learning-based HAR systems are widely used, the impact of activation functions and optimizer choices on performance hasn't been sufficiently studied, especially how their combinations influence model behavior in practical healthcare scenarios.

Method: The study investigates three activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh) combined with four optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, Adagrad) using two recurrent architectures (BiLSTM and ConvLSTM). Experiments conducted on six medically relevant activity classes from HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets.

Result: ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM with Adam or RMSprop achieves up to 99.00% accuracy, showing strong spatio-temporal learning. BiLSTM performs reasonably on UCF101 (~98.00%) but drops to ~60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness.

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for healthcare environments requiring fast, precise activity detection. ConvLSTM with Adam/RMSprop is recommended for robust performance across datasets.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in healthcare, surveillance, and innovative environments, where reliable action recognition supports timely decision-making and automation. Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations. This study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for real-world healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiDARDraft: A method for generating realistic LiDAR point clouds from various inputs (text, images, sketches) using 3D layouts as intermediate representation and ControlNet for guided generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous LiDAR generation methods struggle with high-quality results and versatile controllability due to imbalance between complex LiDAR distributions and simple control signals.

Method: Uses 3D layouts as bridge between conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. Transforms text, images, and point clouds into unified 3D layouts, then semantic and depth control signals. Employs rangemap-based ControlNet for pixel-level alignment guidance.

Result: Demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point cloud generation, enabling "simulation from scratch" from arbitrary textual descriptions, images, and sketches.

Conclusion: LiDARDraft effectively addresses the controllability-quality tradeoff in LiDAR generation, enabling flexible creation of self-driving environments from diverse inputs.

Abstract: Generating realistic and diverse LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous driving simulation. Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation. This pixel-level alignment approach demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point clouds generation, enabling "simulation from scratch", allowing self-driving environments to be created from arbitrary textual descriptions, images and sketches.

*Thanh-Tung Le,Tuan Pham,Tung Nguyen,Deying Kong,Xiaohui Xie,Stephan Mandt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid framework combining deterministic and diffusion-based approaches for novel view synthesis, achieving SOTA quality with 10x faster rendering than fully generative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic NVS methods render quickly but blur unobserved areas, while diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content but are computationally expensive. Need a solution that combines speed and quality.

Method: Unified framework with bidirectional transformer encoding multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings. Two lightweight heads: feed-forward regression head for well-constrained geometry, and masked autoregressive diffusion head for occluded/unseen regions. End-to-end training with joint photometric and diffusion losses, no handcrafted 3D biases.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared to fully generative baselines.

Conclusion: Proposed hybrid framework successfully unifies deterministic and stochastic approaches, enabling fast, high-quality novel view synthesis without manual 3D priors, scalable across diverse scenes.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) seeks to render photorealistic, 3D-consistent images of a scene from unseen camera poses given only a sparse set of posed views. Existing deterministic networks render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, whereas stochastic diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content yet incur heavy training- and inference-time costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads then act on this representation: (i) a feed-forward regression head that renders pixels where geometry is well constrained, and (ii) a masked autoregressive diffusion head that completes occluded or unseen regions. The entire model is trained end-to-end with joint photometric and diffusion losses, without handcrafted 3D inductive biases, enabling scalability across diverse scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared with fully generative baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDAVS is a novel framework for Audio-Visual Segmentation that addresses multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment through disentangled audio semantics and delayed bidirectional alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVS methods suffer from multi-source entanglement (biases toward louder/larger objects while overlooking weaker/smaller/co-occurring sources) and audio-visual misalignment, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: DDAVS uses learnable queries to extract audio semantics anchored in a structured semantic space from an audio prototype memory bank, optimized via contrastive learning. It introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction for robust multimodal alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks show DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: DDAVS effectively addresses key challenges in AVS through disentangled audio semantics and delayed bidirectional alignment, validating its effectiveness for challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to localize sound-producing objects at the pixel level by jointly leveraging auditory and visual information. However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

### [35] [HEART-VIT: Hessian-Guided Efficient Dynamic Attention and Token Pruning in Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20120)
*Mohammad Helal Uddin,Liam Seymour,Sabur Baidya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HEART-ViT is a Hessian-guided framework for dynamic attention and token pruning in Vision Transformers that achieves significant computational savings while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers have state-of-the-art accuracy but suffer from quadratic attention cost and redundant computations, making them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning methods treat tokens or heads separately, rely on heuristics, and often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize.

Method: HEART-ViT uses Hessian-vector products to estimate curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets. It's a unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework that combines token pruning (for computational savings) and head pruning (for fine-grained redundancy removal).

Result: On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4% FLOPs reduction, 36% lower latency, and 46% higher throughput while matching or surpassing baseline accuracy (e.g., 4.7% recovery at 40% token pruning). Real-world deployment on edge devices like AGX Orin shows direct improvements in inference speed and energy efficiency.

Conclusion: HEART-ViT bridges theory and practice as the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient, offering a superior trade-off between computational efficiency and model performance for Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) deliver state-of-the-art accuracy but their quadratic attention cost and redundant computations severely hinder deployment on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.

TL;DR: milliMamba: A radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework using Mamba architecture to handle sparse radar signals by modeling spatio-temporal dependencies across feature extraction and decoding stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millimeter-wave radar provides privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant human pose estimation, but suffers from sparse signals due to specular reflection, making robust feature extraction challenging.

Method: Uses Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder for efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction from longer sequences with linear complexity, and Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder to predict joint coordinates across multiple frames. Incorporates velocity loss alongside keypoint loss for motion smoothness.

Result: Achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding baselines by 11.0 AP on TransHuPR and 14.6 AP on HuPR datasets while maintaining reasonable complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed spatio-temporal modeling pipeline effectively leverages contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections in radar-based pose estimation.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant alternative to RGB sensors for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) task. However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

TL;DR: Proposed pipeline using 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct orchard scenes and automate annotation for apple pose estimation, reducing manual annotation by 99.6% while achieving good performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Apple pose estimation in orchards is challenging due to environmental variation, occlusions, and difficulty in annotating key points like calyx. Traditional methods require time-consuming manual annotations that can be conflicting or missing due to occlusions.

Method: Novel pipeline combining 3D Gaussian Splatting for scene reconstruction, simplified annotations, automated projection of annotations to images, and training/evaluation of pose estimation models. Uses 3D reconstruction to generate training labels from minimal manual annotations.

Result: Only 105 manual annotations needed to generate 28,191 training labels (99.6% reduction). Best performance achieved with labels of fruits ≤95% occluded (F1: 0.927 on original images, 0.970 on rendered). Least occluded fruits had best position estimation; orientation estimation remained challenging.

Conclusion: 3D reconstruction methods can dramatically reduce annotation effort for orchard automation tasks while maintaining good pose estimation performance, though orientation estimation remains a challenge for current methods.

Abstract: Automating tasks in orchards is challenging because of the large amount of variation in the environment and occlusions. One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\leq95\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDi is a latent diffusion-based low-shot object counter that generates high-quality density maps for accurate object localization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on FSC and MCAC benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing low-shot object counting methods have limitations: density-based counters have poor localization capabilities, while point-detection-based counters underperform on images with very large numbers of objects and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling.

Method: CoDi uses latent diffusion to generate high-quality density maps, with a novel exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts object prototypes to intermediate layers of the denoising network for accurate object location estimation.

Result: On FSC benchmark: 15% MAE improvement in few-shot, 13% MAE in one-shot, and 10% MAE in reference-less scenarios. On MCAC benchmark: 44% MAE improvement over top method.

Conclusion: CoDi is the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that effectively addresses dense regions with small objects, providing both accurate total counts and precise object localization through high-quality density maps.

Abstract: Low-shot object counting addresses estimating the number of previously unobserved objects in an image using only few or no annotated test-time exemplars. A considerable challenge for modern low-shot counters are dense regions with small objects. While total counts in such situations are typically well addressed by density-based counters, their usefulness is limited by poor localization capabilities. This is better addressed by point-detection-based counters, which are based on query-based detectors. However, due to limited number of pre-trained queries, they underperform on images with very large numbers of objects, and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling. We propose CoDi, the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that produces high-quality density maps on which object locations can be determined by non-maxima suppression. Our core contribution is the new exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts the object prototypes to the intermediate layers of the denoising network, leading to accurate object location estimation. On FSC benchmark, CoDi outperforms state-of-the-art by 15% MAE, 13% MAE and 10% MAE in the few-shot, one-shot, and reference-less scenarios, respectively, and sets a new state-of-the-art on MCAC benchmark by outperforming the top method by 44% MAE.

Motivation: Vision foundation models trained via multi-teacher distillation show promise for unified visual representations, but their learning dynamics and data efficiency remain underexplored. The paper aims to systematically study multi-teacher distillation and identify key factors for lower computational cost training.

Method: Introduces AMoE which distills knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 into a Mixture-of-Experts student.

Result: Developed OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus demonstrating superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. The distilled models show effective knowledge transfer while preserving teacher geometric properties, stable learning across resolutions, and substantial improvement in sample efficiency over random sampling.

Conclusion: The paper presents a systematic approach to multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models, identifying key factors for efficient training. The introduced techniques enable effective knowledge transfer from multiple teachers while reducing computational costs, with released models and dataset (OpenLVD200M) for community use.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained via multi-teacher distillation offer a promising path toward unified visual representations, yet the learning dynamics and data efficiency of such approaches remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts. We release OpenLVD200M and distilled models.

Motivation: Existing DIR methods use image queries that only retrieve documents within coarse semantic categories (e.g., newspapers or receipts), but struggle with real-world scenarios where users provide textual queries with fine-grained semantics.

Method: Created NL-DIR benchmark with 41K authentic document images, each paired with 5 high-quality fine-grained semantic queries generated using LLMs and manual verification. Evaluated existing contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free VDU models in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. Also investigated a two-stage retrieval method for efficiency.

Result: Proposed NL-DIR benchmark enables evaluation of document retrieval using natural language queries. Evaluations show performance of existing models on this new task, with two-stage method improving performance while maintaining time/space efficiency.

Conclusion: NL-DIR benchmark bridges the gap between coarse image-based retrieval and real-world fine-grained text-based retrieval needs, providing new opportunities for the Visual Document Understanding community. Dataset and code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Document image retrieval (DIR) aims to retrieve document images from a gallery according to a given query. Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community. Datasets and codes will be publicly available at huggingface.co/datasets/nianbing/NL-DIR.

### [41] [JDPNet: A Network Based on Joint Degradation Processing for Underwater Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20213)
*Tao Ye,Hongbin Ren,Chongbing Zhang,Haoran Chen,Xiaosong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JDPNet is a joint degradation processing network that addresses the challenge of nonlinearly coupled degradations in underwater images through unified feature mining and multi-loss optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from complex, nonlinearly coupled degradations (not simple superposition) that existing methods struggle to handle effectively because they focus on specific degradations separately rather than capturing their interactions.

Method: Proposes JDPNet with: 1) joint feature-mining module and probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy to mine and unify coupled degradation features, and 2) AquaBalanceLoss to balance color, clarity, and contrast through multi-loss learning.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on six public underwater datasets and two new datasets, with better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost.

Conclusion: JDPNet effectively addresses coupled underwater degradations through unified feature mining and multi-loss optimization, outperforming existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Given the complexity of underwater environments and the variability of water as a medium, underwater images are inevitably subject to various types of degradation. The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a joint feature-mining module, along with a probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, to facilitate effective mining and unified adjustment of coupled degradation features. Furthermore, to balance color, clarity, and contrast, we design a novel AquaBalanceLoss to guide the network in learning from multiple coupled degradation losses. Experiments on six publicly available underwater datasets, as well as two new datasets constructed in this study, show that JDPNet exhibits state-of-the-art performance while offering a better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost.

*Xiangxuan Ren,Zhongdao Wang,Pin Tang,Guoqing Wang,Jilai Zheng,Chao Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteFusion: A lightweight multi-modal 3D detector that uses LiDAR as complementary geometric information rather than independent modality, eliminating 3D backbone dependency for better deployment across diverse hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal 3D detectors rely heavily on LiDAR and complex architectures, suffering performance drops without LiDAR and deployment difficulties on non-GPU hardware due to 3D sparse convolution operators optimized for NVIDIA GPUs.

Method: Treats LiDAR as complementary geometric information rather than independent modality, integrates LiDAR features into image features in quaternion space to preserve orthogonal constraints, eliminating 3D backbone entirely for deployment-friendly design.

Result: Improves baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS on nuScenes with only 1.1% parameter increase, maintains strong performance even without LiDAR input, demonstrating robustness across fusion paradigms.

Conclusion: LiteFusion provides a deployment-friendly multi-modal 3D detection approach that enhances camera-based detection with LiDAR geometric information while maintaining robustness and hardware compatibility across diverse platforms.

Abstract: 3D object detection is fundamental for safe and robust intelligent transportation systems. Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders. Notably, even in the absence of LiDAR input, LiteFusion maintains strong results , highlighting its favorable robustness and effectiveness across diverse fusion paradigms and deployment scenarios.

*Oikantik Nath,Sahithi Kukkala,Mitesh Khapra,Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndicDLP is a large-scale multilingual document layout dataset covering 11 Indic languages plus English across 12 document domains, addressing limitations of existing datasets in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document layout datasets have critical limitations: large-scale datasets (PubLayNet, DocBank) lack fine-grained labels and multilingual diversity, while human-annotated datasets (M6Doc, D4LA) are too small and lack multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents with diverse scripts, limiting progress in document understanding.

Method: Created IndicDLP dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English, covering 12 common document domains. Also curated UED-mini dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc to enhance pretraining. Fine-tuned existing English models on IndicDLP to validate effectiveness.

Result: Fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance. Models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, demonstrating its value for document digitization.

Conclusion: IndicDLP bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity for document layout analysis, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for multilingual document digitization.

Abstract: Document layout analysis is essential for downstream tasks such as information retrieval, extraction, OCR, and digitization. However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization. This work bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiCoR-Seg is a bidirectional co-refinement framework for high-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation that addresses inter-class similarity and intra-class variability through heatmap-driven information synergy and hierarchical supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HRSS methods struggle with high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. Current approaches fail to effectively inject abstract semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning.

Method: Proposes BiCoR-Seg with three key components: 1) Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS) that establishes bidirectional flow between feature maps and class embeddings via class-level heatmaps, 2) Hierarchical supervision using interpretable heatmaps as low-resolution predictions, and 3) Cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and inter-class separability.

Result: Extensive experiments on LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate outstanding segmentation performance with stronger interpretability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: BiCoR-Seg effectively addresses the challenges of HRSS by establishing bidirectional refinement between feature maps and class embeddings, achieving superior performance while providing enhanced interpretability through heatmap-based supervision.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation (HRSS) is a fundamental yet critical task in the field of Earth observation. However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LADLE-MM is a lightweight multimodal misinformation detector that achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters and limited annotations, outperforming more complex models on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of accessible tools for generating and manipulating multimedia content has created widespread threats of synthetic media alterations used to spread misinformation. Existing multimodal misinformation detectors are computationally intensive or require large annotated datasets, creating a need for more efficient solutions.

Method: LADLE-MM uses a model-soup initialized architecture with two unimodal branches (image and text) and a multimodal branch that enhances representations with BLIP-extracted multimodal embeddings as a fixed reference space. It operates under limited annotation setups and constrained training resources.

Result: Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. It also outperforms more complex LVLM-based approaches on the VERITE dataset, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness to unimodal bias.

Conclusion: LADLE-MM provides an efficient and effective solution for multimodal misinformation detection that works well with limited annotations and computational resources, offering better generalization and robustness than more complex alternatives while being more resource-efficient.

Abstract: With the rise of easily accessible tools for generating and manipulating multimedia content, realistic synthetic alterations to digital media have become a widespread threat, often involving manipulations across multiple modalities simultaneously. Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.

*Jiawei Ge,Jiuxin Cao,Xinyi Li,Xuelin Zhu,Chang Liu,Bo Liu,Chen Feng,Ioannis Patras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D³ETOR is a two-stage weakly-supervised camouflaged object detection framework that uses debate-enhanced pseudo labeling and frequency-aware progressive debiasing to overcome limitations of existing WSCOD methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSCOD methods underperform fully supervised approaches due to unreliable pseudo masks from general segmentation models lacking COD-specific understanding, and neglect of inherent scribble annotation bias that prevents capturing global object structure.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling with adaptive entropy-driven point sampling and multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance SAM for COD; 2) FADeNet with progressive fusion of multi-level frequency-aware features and dynamic supervision reweighting to balance global semantics with local details while alleviating scribble bias.

Result: Significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks by jointly exploiting supervision from both pseudo masks and scribble semantics.

Conclusion: D³ETOR effectively addresses key limitations in WSCOD through its innovative two-stage approach, demonstrating that carefully designed weakly-supervised methods can approach the performance of fully supervised systems for camouflaged object detection.

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: A framework combining Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify uncertainty in SHAP explanations for medical imaging, addressing instability from epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging have become increasingly complex (ResNets, Vision Transformers, Hybrid CNNs), compromising explainability. While SHAP provides interpretable visualizations, its explanations can be unstable and unreliable due to epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, especially in medical imaging with varying data characteristics.

Method: Proposes a framework using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify uncertainty in SHAP explanations. Uses belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis. Evaluated on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types (pathology, ophthalmology, radiology).

Result: The framework produces quantification of uncertainty in SHAP explanations for medical imaging applications, addressing instability from epistemic uncertainty introduced by varying image resolutions, modality-specific aspects, and data heterogeneity across different medical domains.

Conclusion: The proposed uncertainty quantification framework enhances the reliability of SHAP explanations in medical imaging by addressing their instability through formal uncertainty measurement using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory, making model interpretations more trustworthy for domain experts.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains, including medical imaging. This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.

TL;DR: KeyTailor is a diffusion transformer-based video virtual try-on framework with keyframe-driven details injection and a new high-quality dataset ViT-HD, addressing garment dynamics and background consistency issues in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DiT-based video virtual try-on methods struggle with capturing fine-grained garment dynamics, preserving background integrity across frames, have high computational costs from additional modules, and are limited by small/low-quality datasets.

Method: KeyTailor uses keyframe-driven details injection: 1) instruction-guided keyframe sampling to filter informative frames, 2) garment details enhancement module to distill dynamics into garment latents, 3) collaborative background optimization module to maintain background integrity, all guided by keyframes without modifying DiT architecture.

Result: KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios, while being more computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed KeyTailor framework with keyframe-driven injection strategy and the ViT-HD dataset effectively addresses garment dynamics and background consistency challenges in video virtual try-on, achieving superior performance without architectural modifications to DiTs.

Abstract: Although diffusion transformer (DiT)-based video virtual try-on (VVT) has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic videos, existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained garment dynamics and preserve background integrity across video frames. They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios.

*V. Kovalev,A. Kuvshinov,A. Buzovkin,D. Pokidov,D. Timonin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT introduces a training-free framework that applies structured reasoning to text-to-image generation by decomposing prompts into visual questions, verifying images with vision-language models, and making targeted prompt edits through LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time reasoning approaches for text-to-image generation rely on implicit critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making them difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. The paper aims to bring the structured reasoning paradigm that has benefited large language models (with verification, targeted correction, and early stopping) to multimodal image generation.

Method: CRAFT decomposes prompts into dependency-structured visual questions, verifies generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satisfied, creating an interpretable and controllable inference-time refinement loop.

Result: CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. These improvements come with negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller models to approach the quality of more expensive systems.

Conclusion: Explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models, offering interpretable and controllable refinement without retraining.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that inference-time reasoning and reflection can improve text-to-image generation without retraining. However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.
  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.
  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.

TL;DR: SmartSplat is a Gaussian Splatting-based image compression framework that uses adaptive feature-aware sampling to achieve high compression ratios while maintaining reconstruction quality for ultra-high-resolution images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of ultra-high-resolution visual content from generative AI creates challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Existing 2D Gaussian image models struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity at ultra-high resolutions.

Method: SmartSplat uses image-aware features (gradients and color variances) with Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling and Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling to improve Gaussian primitive coverage. It also employs Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling for better color initialization across scales, jointly optimizing spatial layout, scale, and color initialization.

Result: SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios on DIV8K and a new 16K dataset, exceeding their compression limits while showing strong scalability and practical applicability.

Conclusion: SmartSplat effectively addresses ultra-high-resolution image compression challenges by adaptively capturing both local structures and global textures with limited Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the production of ultra-high-resolution visual content, posing significant challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability.

*Junho Yoon,Jaemo Jung,Hyunju Kim,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DETACH: A decomposed spatio-temporal framework for aligning exocentric video with ambient sensors, addressing limitations of global alignment approaches in capturing local details and handling similar temporal patterns with different contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric video with wearable sensors has practical limitations (user discomfort, privacy concerns, scalability). Exocentric video with ambient sensors offers a non-intrusive, scalable alternative, but existing global alignment methods fail in this setting due to inability to capture local details and over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns.

Method: DETACH decomposes spatio-temporal features explicitly to preserve local details. Uses novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering for semantic grounding. Two-stage alignment: first establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles different types of negatives.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: DETACH effectively addresses the limitations of global alignment for exocentric-ambient sensor settings by decomposing spatio-temporal features and using context-aware alignment, providing a scalable, non-intrusive solution for human action recognition.

Abstract: Aligning egocentric video with wearable sensors have shown promise for human action recognition, but face practical limitations in user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability. We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoAT (Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts) is a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces criminal bias into LVLM reasoning to improve crime detection in video surveillance, boosting anomaly detection by 11.8 p.p. and classification by 3.78 p.p.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Vision-Language Models for video surveillance have inherent bias towards normality, often failing to detect crimes. Chain-of-Thought reasoning lacks inductive anomaly biases, further steering models towards normal interpretations.

Method: Proposes Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer to steer reasoning toward detecting criminal activities.

Result: Significantly improves Anomaly Detection with 11.8 percentage point F1-score boost on challenging low-resolution footage, and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 percentage points in high-resolution videos.

Conclusion: Introducing inductive criminal bias through CoAT framework effectively addresses LVLM's normality bias in video surveillance, substantially improving crime detection performance across different video quality conditions.

Abstract: Automated video surveillance with Large Vision-Language Models is limited by their inherent bias towards normality, often failing to detect crimes. While Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies show significant potential for improving performance in language tasks, the lack of inductive anomaly biases in their reasoning further steers the models towards normal interpretations. To address this, we propose Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias in the reasoning process through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer. Our method significantly improves Anomaly Detection, boosting F1-score by 11.8 p.p. on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.

Abstract: Skin cancer can be identified by dermoscopic examination and ocular inspection, but early detection significantly increases survival chances. Artificial intelligence (AI), using annotated skin images and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), improves diagnostic accuracy. This paper presents an early skin cancer classification method using a soft voting ensemble of CNNs. In this investigation, three benchmark datasets, namely HAM10000, ISIC 2016, and ISIC 2019, were used. The process involved rebalancing, image augmentation, and filtering techniques, followed by a hybrid dual encoder for segmentation via transfer learning. Accurate segmentation focused classification models on clinically significant features, reducing background artifacts and improving accuracy. Classification was performed through an ensemble of MobileNetV2, VGG19, and InceptionV3, balancing accuracy and speed for real-world deployment. The method achieved lesion recognition accuracies of 96.32\%, 90.86\%, and 93.92\% for the three datasets. The system performance was evaluated using established skin lesion detection metrics, yielding impressive results.

TL;DR: Proposes TBSD method for efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds, using texture basis functions to extract quasi-periodic patterns and prevent texture misidentification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations when applied to textured defect images: non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale structured datasets.

Method: Texture Basis Integrated Smooth Decomposition (TBSD) approach with two principal processes: 1) learns texture basis functions to extract quasi-periodic texture patterns, 2) uses texture basis as prior knowledge for anomaly detection to prevent texture misidentification.

Result: The method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: TBSD provides an efficient approach for anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies, overcoming limitations of conventional methods through mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and texture basis learning.

Abstract: In the realm of diverse high-dimensional data, images play a significant role across various processes of manufacturing systems where efficient image anomaly detection has emerged as a core technology of utmost importance. However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: Incorporating physically inferred joint actuation forces into motion understanding pipelines consistently improves performance across gait recognition, action recognition, and video captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing vision-based motion understanding methods overlook physical cues like joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics, creating a gap in understanding whether and when these forces enhance motion analysis.

Method: Incorporating physically inferred forces into established motion understanding pipelines and systematically evaluating their impact across baseline models on three major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning.

Result: Across 8 benchmarks, force incorporation yielded consistent performance gains: gait recognition improved by +0.87% on CASIA-B (with larger gains under challenging conditions: +2.7% with coat, +3.0% side view), +1.3% on Gait3D; action recognition improved by +2.00% on Penn Action (+6.96% for high-exertion classes); video captioning ROUGE-L score improved by +0.029.

Conclusion: Physics-inferred forces substantially complement visual and kinematic features, especially under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions, enhancing temporal grounding and semantic richness in motion understanding.

Abstract: Human motion understanding has advanced rapidly through vision-based progress in recognition, tracking, and captioning. However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness. These results demonstrate that force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While diffusion-based text-to-image models have strong visual content generation capabilities, their text rendering performance for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts remains limited, creating a need for better AI-assisted graphic design tools.

Method: Proposes UTDesign with three key components: 1) A novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on synthetic data to generate transparent RGBA text foregrounds, 2) Extension to conditional text generation via multi-modal condition encoder trained on curated text annotations, and 3) Integration into a fully automated text-to-design pipeline using pre-trained T2I models and MLLM-based layout planner.

Result: UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

Conclusion: UTDesign provides an effective unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, addressing limitations of existing diffusion models for text rendering, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts like Chinese.

Abstract: AI-assisted graphic design has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the creation and editing of design elements such as posters, banners, and advertisements. While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This research evaluates adaptive RGB and LWIR fusion for UAS-based landmine detection, finding YOLOv11 with 10-30% thermal fusion at 5-10m altitude achieves optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with significant tradeoffs between accuracy and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Landmines pose a severe humanitarian threat with 110 million actively deployed mines across 60 countries causing 26,000 casualties annually. There's a need for effective UAS-based detection methods leveraging thermal contrast between ordnance and surrounding soil.

Method: Used adaptive RGB and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for UAS-based detection, evaluated YOLO architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations. Compared YOLOv11 with RF-DETR, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet, and tested aggregated multi-temporal training datasets versus season-specific approaches.

Result: YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP) with 10-30% thermal fusion at 5-10m altitude. RF-DETR had highest accuracy (69.2% mAP) but YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster (41 min vs 12 hours). Multi-temporal datasets outperformed season-specific by 1.8-9.6%. AT mines detected at 61.9% vs AP mines at 19.2%.

Conclusion: Adaptive thermal fusion significantly enhances landmine detection, with YOLOv11 offering the best balance of accuracy and efficiency for operational deployment. Future research should examine thermal contrast effects for buried mines across different soil types and depths.

Abstract: Landmines remain a persistent humanitarian threat, with 110 million actively deployed mines across 60 countries, claiming 26,000 casualties annually. This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.

Abstract: We introduce SirenPose, a geometry-aware loss formulation that integrates the periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks with keypoint-based geometric supervision, enabling accurate and temporally consistent reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos. Existing approaches often struggle with motion fidelity and spatiotemporal coherence in challenging settings involving fast motion, multi-object interaction, occlusion, and rapid scene changes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignPose is a multi-view 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates RGB information from calibrated cameras without object-specific training, using novel multi-view feature-metric refinement to achieve state-of-the-art performance on industrial datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view RGB pose estimation suffers from depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions. Multi-view methods could solve these issues but either rely on precise single-view estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects.

Method: AlignPose aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views without object-specific training. Key innovation is multi-view feature-metric refinement that optimizes a single consistent world-frame object pose by minimizing feature discrepancy between rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously.

Result: Extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using BOP benchmark show AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available.

Conclusion: AlignPose effectively addresses limitations of single-view pose estimation through multi-view aggregation and feature-metric refinement, achieving superior performance particularly in industrial applications where multiple camera views are available.

Abstract: Single-view RGB model-based object pose estimation methods achieve strong generalization but are fundamentally limited by depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions. Multi-view pose estimation methods have the potential to solve these issues, but existing works rely on precise single-view pose estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects. We address these challenges via the following three contributions. First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose. It optimizes a single, consistent world-frame object pose minimizing the feature discrepancy between on-the-fly rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously. Third, we report extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using the BOP benchmark evaluation and show that AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available in practice.

TL;DR: MTIF introduces multi-grained text descriptions with hierarchical cross-modal modulation for improved image fusion, outperforming previous methods on exposure and focus fusion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided image fusion methods use coarse-grained descriptions that fail to capture fine details and struggle with precise cross-modal alignment, limiting fusion quality.

Method: Proposes MTIF with: 1) multi-grained textual descriptions (fine details, structural cues, semantic content), 2) hierarchical cross-modal modulation module, 3) granularity-specific supervision signals, and 4) saliency-driven enrichment module for training data augmentation.

Result: Extensive experiments show MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

Conclusion: MTIF's multi-grained text guidance with hierarchical modulation effectively addresses cross-modal alignment challenges and improves image fusion quality across different challenging conditions.

Abstract: Image fusion aims to synthesize a single high-quality image from a pair of inputs captured under challenging conditions, such as differing exposure levels or focal depths. A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

TL;DR: DSR Suite bridges dynamic spatial reasoning gap in VLMs through automated 4D-aware dataset generation (DSR-Train/Bench) and a Geometry Selection Module for targeted geometric knowledge integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models are weak at dynamic spatial reasoning (reasoning about object geometry and relationships in 3D space over time) due to scarcity of scalable 4D-aware training resources.

Method: 1) Automated pipeline generating multiple-choice QA pairs from in-the-wild videos using vision foundation models to extract geometric/motion info; 2) Geometry Selection Module (GSM) that condenses question semantics and extracts relevant knowledge from 4D reconstruction priors into compact geometry tokens.

Result: Integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances dynamic spatial reasoning capability while maintaining accuracy on general video understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: DSR Suite successfully addresses the dynamic spatial reasoning gap in VLMs through comprehensive dataset generation and targeted geometric knowledge integration, enabling better 4D-aware reasoning without compromising general video understanding.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) excel at general understanding yet remain weak at dynamic spatial reasoning (DSR), i.e., reasoning about the evolvement of object geometry and relationship in 3D space over time, largely due to the scarcity of scalable 4D-aware training resources. To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge. Experiments show that integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances its dynamic spatial reasoning capability, while maintaining accuracy on general video understanding benchmarks.

TL;DR: FlashVLM is a text-guided visual token selection framework that dynamically prunes visual tokens based on query relevance and visual saliency, achieving beyond lossless compression while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs process hundreds/thousands of visual tokens per image/frame, incurring quadratic attention costs and redundancy. Existing token reduction methods ignore textual queries or rely on unstable deep attention maps, leading to degraded semantic alignment.

Method: Computes explicit cross-modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in language model space. Fuses extrinsic relevance with intrinsic visual saliency using log-domain weighting and temperature-controlled sharpening. Includes diversity-preserving partition to retain minimal background tokens for global context.

Result: Achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8% of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5. Maintains 92.8% accuracy even under 94.4% compression. State-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across 14 image/video benchmarks with strong robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: FlashVLM provides an effective text-guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to queries, achieving significant computational savings while maintaining or improving performance across mainstream VLMs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.
  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.
  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.

TL;DR: TransFuser v6 achieves SOTA on CARLA benchmarks by addressing expert-student misalignment in imitation learning through interventions that narrow visibility, uncertainty, and navigational intent gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning policies in simulation struggle with robust closed-loop performance despite unlimited data, due to misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations (with higher visibility and lower uncertainty) and sensor-based student observations.

Method: Address asymmetries between expert and student by modifying the imitation learning framework to narrow gaps in visibility, uncertainty, and navigational intent specification. Integrate perception supervision from dataset into shared sim-to-real pipeline.

Result: TransFuser v6 achieves new SOTA on all major CARLA closed-loop benchmarks: 95 DS on Bench2Drive, more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Also shows consistent gains on NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End benchmarks.

Conclusion: Careful modifications to address expert-student misalignment significantly improve imitation learning performance in autonomous driving, enabling state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks and demonstrating transferability to real-world datasets.

Abstract: Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.

TL;DR: DiTracker adapts pre-trained video Diffusion Transformers for point tracking, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks with efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point tracking methods use shallow convolutional backbones that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and struggling with challenging conditions like dynamic motions and occlusions.

Method: Adapts pre-trained video Diffusion Transformers through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks, despite training with 8 times smaller batch size.

Conclusion: Video Diffusion Transformers pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos exhibit strong inherent point tracking capabilities and serve as an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking tasks.

Abstract: Point tracking aims to localize corresponding points across video frames, serving as a fundamental task for 4D reconstruction, robotics, and video editing. Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions. We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks. Our work validates video DiT features as an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking.

*Daewoon Kim,Si Young Yie,Jae Sung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedPOD improves federated learning efficiency and communication costs by including outlier participants, eliminating dependency on previous rounds, and using validation loss calculation, achieving comparable performance to FedPIDAvg while being Kubernetes-compatible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FedPIDAvg has limitations: it excludes outlier participants based on Poisson distribution, limiting data utilization, and requires maintaining the same participants throughout training due to PID controller's dependency on previous rounds' learning information.

Method: FedPOD includes participants excluded as outliers, eliminates dependency on previous rounds' learning information, applies validation loss calculation at each round, and is designed as round-wise tasks compatible with Kubernetes' POD concept for auto-scaling flexibility.

Result: FedPOD achieves comparable performance to FedPIDAvg with Dice scores of 0.78, 0.71, and 0.72 for WT, ET, and TC respectively, and projected convergence score of 0.74 on average.

Conclusion: FedPOD demonstrates potential to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance metrics while being compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling for flexible deployment.

Abstract: This paper proposes FedPOD (Proportionally Orchestrated Derivative) for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.

TL;DR: ORCA framework enables video avatars to autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction, moving beyond passive animation to active intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video avatar generation methods lack genuine agency - they can preserve identity and align motion but cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. There's a need to advance video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.

Method: ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture) framework with two key innovations: (1) closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) for robust state tracking under generative uncertainty, and (2) hierarchical dual-system architecture (System 2 for strategic reasoning, System 1 for precise action caption translation). Formulates avatar control as a POMDP with continuous belief updating and outcome verification.

Result: ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence. Demonstrates autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: The IWM-inspired design successfully advances video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior, enabling genuine agency through adaptive environmental interaction and long-term goal pursuit.

Abstract: Current video avatar generation methods excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but lack genuine agency, they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.

*Yuxi Xiao,Longfei Li,Shen Yan,Xinhang Liu,Sida Peng,Yunchao Wei,Xiaowei Zhou,Bingyi Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialTree is a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchical benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs' spatial abilities across four levels (perception to agentic competence), revealing skill interdependencies and transfer dynamics, with proposed auto-think strategy for consistent improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLM research lacks understanding of spatial ability development hierarchy, with most studies focusing on narrow task sets rather than systematic cognitive progression from perception to reasoning and interaction.

Method: Introduces SpatialTree - a four-level hierarchical taxonomy (L1 perception, L2 mental mapping, L3 simulation, L4 agentic competence) with 27 sub-abilities benchmark. Evaluates mainstream MLLMs, studies transfer dynamics via supervised fine-tuning, and proposes auto-think strategy to optimize reinforcement learning across levels.

Result: Reveals clear hierarchical structure: L1 skills are orthogonal while higher-level skills show strong correlation and interdependency. Identifies negative transfer within L1 but strong cross-level transfer from low to high abilities with synergy. Shows naive RL helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception, while auto-think strategy enables consistent improvement across all levels.

Conclusion: SpatialTree provides a framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs, demonstrating hierarchical skill organization, transfer dynamics, and the importance of suppressing unnecessary deliberation for balanced improvement across cognitive levels.

Abstract: Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.

TL;DR: SemanticGen is a two-stage video generation method that first generates compact semantic features for global planning, then adds high-frequency details via VAE latents, achieving faster convergence and computational efficiency for long videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generative models that operate in VAE latent space suffer from slow convergence and high computational costs, especially for long video generation. The authors aim to address these limitations by leveraging the inherent redundancy in videos.

Method: Two-stage generation: 1) A diffusion model generates compact semantic video features for global layout planning, 2) Another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce final output with high-frequency details.

Result: SemanticGen achieves faster convergence compared to VAE latent space methods, is computationally efficient for long video generation, and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines in producing high-quality videos.

Conclusion: Generating videos in semantic space first for global planning, then adding details, is an effective approach that addresses convergence and computational efficiency limitations of direct VAE latent space generation.

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.

TL;DR: A method to compress 360-degree videos using pretrained neural video compression models without retraining, adapting quantization parameters based on latitude to account for equirectangular projection distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360-degree equirectangular videos have spatially varying sampling density due to projection distortions, but existing neural video compression models aren't optimized for this. Traditional video codecs use adaptive quantization, but neural models lack this capability without architectural changes.

Method: Extends quantization parameter adaptation from traditional codecs to neural video compression using latitude-based adaptive quality parameters. Uses vector bank interpolation for latent modulation to enable flexible adaptation with arbitrary quality parameters and mitigate rounding errors.

Result: Applied to DCVC-RT framework, achieved 5.2% BD-Rate savings in weighted spherical PSNR for JVET class S1 test sequences, with only 0.3% increase in processing time.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively compresses 360-degree videos using pretrained NVC models without architectural changes or retraining, achieving significant bitrate savings with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: This study proposes a practical approach for compressing 360-degree equirectangular videos using pretrained neural video compression (NVC) models. Without requiring additional training or changes in the model architectures, the proposed method extends quantization parameter adaptation techniques from traditional video codecs to NVC, utilizing the spatially varying sampling density in equirectangular projections. We introduce latitude-based adaptive quality parameters through rate-distortion optimization for NVC. The proposed method utilizes vector bank interpolation for latent modulation, enabling flexible adaptation with arbitrary quality parameters and mitigating the limitations caused by rounding errors in the adaptive quantization parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that applying this method to the DCVC-RT framework yields BD-Rate savings of 5.2% in terms of the weighted spherical peak signal-to-noise ratio for JVET class S1 test sequences, with only a 0.3% increase in processing time.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper investigates two strategies for multicontrast cardiac MR reconstruction: physics-consistent data-space augmentation (DualSpaceCMR) and parameter-efficient capacity scaling via VQPrompt and Moero, evaluated on the CMRxRecon25 benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective strategies for multicontrast cardiac MR reconstruction that can generalize well in few-shot and out-of-distribution scenarios, addressing the challenges of limited data and domain shifts in medical imaging.

Method: Two complementary approaches: 1) DualSpaceCMR - physics-consistent data-space augmentation coupling image-level transforms with k-space noise and motion simulations while preserving forward model consistency; 2) Parameter-efficient capacity scaling using VQPrompt (lightweight bottleneck prompt) and Moero (sparse mixture of experts within deep unrolled network with histogram-based routing).

Result: On small datasets, k-space motion-plus-noise augmentation improves reconstruction; on large benchmarks it degrades performance, revealing sensitivity to augmentation ratio and schedule. VQPrompt produces modest consistent gains with negligible memory overhead. Moero continues improving after early plateaus and maintains baseline-like few-shot/OOD behavior despite mild overfitting, but sparse routing lowers throughput.

Conclusion: Scale-aware augmentation is needed, prompt-based capacity scaling offers a practical path, and efficiency improvements are crucial for sparse expert models to address computational bottlenecks.

Abstract: We investigated two complementary strategies for multicontrast cardiac MR reconstruction: physics-consistent data-space augmentation (DualSpaceCMR) and parameter-efficient capacity scaling via VQPrompt and Moero. DualSpaceCMR couples image-level transforms with kspace noise and motion simulations while preserving forwardmodel consistency. VQPrompt adds a lightweight bottleneck prompt; Moero embeds a sparse mixture of experts within a deep unrolled network with histogram-based routing.
  In the multivendor, multisite CMRxRecon25 benchmark, we evaluate fewshot and out-of-distribution generalization. On small datasets, k-space motion-plus-noise improves reconstruction; on the large benchmark it degrades performance, revealing sensitivity to augmentation ratio and schedule. VQPrompt produces modest and consistent gains with negligible memory overhead. Moero continues to improve after early plateaus and maintains baseline-like fewshot and out-of-distribution behavior despite mild overfitting, but sparse routing lowers PyTorch throughput and makes wall clock time the main bottleneck. These results motivate scale-aware augmentation and suggest prompt-based capacity scaling as a practical path, while efficiency improvements are crucial for sparse expert models.

Conclusion: The proposed automated BBPS scoring framework effectively addresses subjectivity issues in manual scoring and shows promise for computer-aided colonoscopy analysis in clinical settings.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of bowel cleanliness is essential for effective colonoscopy procedures. The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) offers a standardized scoring system but suffers from subjectivity and inter-observer variability when performed manually.

Conclusion: The dual-encoder TransUNet framework provides a robust solution for automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation from diffusion MRI, effectively leveraging complementary information from DWI and ADC modalities.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of ischemic stroke lesions from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for clinical decision-making and outcome assessment. Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) scans provide complementary information on acute and sub-acute ischemic changes; however, automated lesion delineation remains challenging due to variability in lesion appearance.
  In this work, we study ischemic stroke lesion segmentation using multimodal diffusion MRI from the ISLES 2022 dataset. Several state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based architectures, including U-Net variants, Swin-UNet, and TransUNet, are benchmarked. Based on performance, a dual-encoder TransUNet architecture is proposed to learn modality-specific representations from DWI and ADC inputs. To incorporate spatial context, adjacent slice information is integrated using a three-slice input configuration.
  All models are trained under a unified framework and evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Results show that transformer-based models outperform convolutional baselines, and the proposed dual-encoder TransUNet achieves the best performance, reaching a Dice score of 85.4% on the test set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for both spectral efficiency and physical-layer security in future IoT networks, while overcoming limitations of conventional joint modulation schemes that require complex synchronization and joint signal design.

Method: Uses multi-mode vortex waves and programmable meta-surfaces to create two logically independent channels: 1) DBM channel using orthogonal vortex modes for high-capacity transmission, and 2) SFM channel using spatial energy focusing via PMS configuration as a lookup table. Implements lightweight dual-channel encryption where DBM carries encrypted symbols and SFM carries the key information.

Result: Experimental prototype validation confirms effective co-existent DBM-SFM design achieving reliable and secure transmission under real-world wireless conditions, demonstrating feasibility of the architecture.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture provides a scalable, low-complexity, and secure transmission solution for IoT networks requiring both spectral efficiency and physical-layer confidentiality, eliminating need for joint signal design or time synchronization.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel secure wireless transmission architecture that enables the co-existence of spatial field modulation (SFM) and digital bandpass modulation (DBM), utilizing multi-mode vortex waves and programmable meta-surfaces (PMS). Distinct from conventional joint modulation schemes, our approach establishes two logically independent transmission channels--SFM and DBM--thereby eliminating the need for joint signal design or time synchronization. Specifically, the orthogonality of vortex wave modes is exploited to construct a high-capacity multi-mode DBM channel, in which each mode carries modulated symbols independently. As the composite waveform passes through the PMS, energy from different vortex modes is spatially focused onto distinct positions, dynamically determined by the PMS configuration. This spatial mapping forms a unique lookup table that encodes additional information in the electro-magnetic (EM) field distribution, effectively enabling a second, concurrent SFM channel. To enhance physical-layer security, the DBM channel transmits encrypted symbols transformed via dynamic symbol-domain mapping, while the corresponding mapping relations--or key information--are carried by the SFM channel. This lightweight dual-channel encryption strategy provides strong confidentiality without requiring complex joint decoding. To validate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, we design and implement a proof-of-concept prototype system, and conduct experimental demonstrations under real-world wireless communication conditions. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the co-existent DBM-SFM design in achieving reliable and secure transmission. The proposed architecture offers a scalable, low-complexity, and secure transmission solution for future IoT networks, especially in scenarios demanding both spectral efficiency and physical-layer confidentiality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To maximize uplink sum rate in pinching antenna systems by leveraging rate-splitting multiple access, addressing the challenge of non-convex joint optimization of antenna positioning and power allocation.

Method: Proposed alternating optimization framework that decomposes the problem into power allocation and antenna position optimization sub-problems, both solved using successive convex approximation algorithms iteratively until convergence.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed RSMA for PASS framework significantly enhances achievable sum rate compared to conventional NOMA and SDMA techniques, with discrete antenna activation also examined.

Conclusion: RSMA combined with PASS and joint optimization of antenna positioning and power allocation provides superior sum rate performance over existing multiple access schemes for uplink communication systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) for uplink pinching antenna system (PASS). Our objective is to maximize the uplink sum rate by jointly optimizing a continuous antenna positioning and user's transmission power. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and difficult to solve directly; to address this challenge, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) framework which decomposes the original problem into two tractable sub-problems, namely (i) power allocation optimization sub-problem and (ii) antenna position optimization sub-problem. Both sub-problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm and solved alternatively until convergence. The RSMA access for PASS is compared with conventional non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and space-division multiple access (SDMA) techniques. The performance of discrete antenna activation with PASS strategy is also examined. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances the achievable sum rate compared to other multiple access methods.

TL;DR: Proposes sensing-secure ISAC signaling design to prevent unauthorized passive sensing by eavesdroppers, using perturbation matrix optimization to degrade Eve's detection while maintaining legitimate sensing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAC systems create new security vulnerabilities in sensing privacy, where unauthorized eavesdroppers can exploit ISAC signals for passive sensing. Current solutions for sensing-secure ISAC are largely unexplored.

Method: Develops ISAC system models for BS, users, and eavesdroppers. Defines KL-divergence detection metric considering ambiguity function components. Formulates sensing-secure signaling design problem using perturbation matrix in time-frequency domain, solved via simulated annealing.

Result: Proposed scheme substantially degrades Eve's detection probability (OTFS: 79.4%→37.4%, OFDM: 94.3%→33.0%) with small BS sensing loss. Enables controllable trade-offs between sensing-security and communication performance.

Conclusion: The work successfully addresses sensing-security in ISAC systems, providing effective protection against unauthorized passive sensing while maintaining legitimate sensing capabilities and communication performance.

Abstract: As integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems are deployed in next-generation wireless networks, a new security vulnerability emerges, particularly in terms of sensing privacy. Unauthorized sensing eavesdroppers (Eve) can potentially exploit the ISAC signal for their own independent passive sensing. However, solutions for sensing-secure ISAC remain largely unexplored to date. This work addresses sensing-security for OFDM- and OTFS-based ISAC waveforms from a target-detection perspective, aiming to prevent Eves from exploiting the ISAC signal for unauthorized passive sensing. We develop ISAC system models for the base station (BS), communication user equipment, and the sensing Eve, and define a Kullback-Leibler-divergence-based detection metric that accounts for mainlobe, sidelobe, and noise components in the ambiguity function and the resulting range-Doppler maps of the legitimate BS's and Eve's sensing. Building on this analysis, we formulate a sensing-secure ISAC signaling design problem that tunes a perturbation matrix to jointly control signal amplitude and phase in the time-frequency domain and solve it via simulated annealing. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme substantially degrades Eve's detection probability -- from 79.4% to 37.4% for OTFS and from 94.3% to 33.0% for OFDM -- while incurring only a small loss in BS sensing performance. In addition, it allows controllable trade-offs across sensing-security and communication performance.

Motivation: The exponential growth of mobile devices and data-intensive applications creates computational burdens on resource-constrained devices, driving the need for efficient AirComp systems. Traditional optimization approaches become intractable in dynamic multi-user environments with execution uncertainty.

Method: Develops a dual-approach framework: 1) For single-user scenarios, uses block coordinate descent (BCD) and majorization-maximization (MM) algorithms with Gamma-distributed workload modeling to solve nonlinear optimization problems; 2) For multi-user scenarios, implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based deep reinforcement learning framework to adaptively learn optimal policies through environment interaction.

Abstract: The exponential proliferation of mobile devices and data-intensive applications in future wireless networks imposes substantial computational burdens on resource-constrained devices, thereby fostering the emergence of over-the-air computation (AirComp) as a transformative paradigm for edge intelligence.} To enhance the efficiency and scalability of AirComp systems, this paper proposes a comprehensive dual-approach framework that systematically transitions from traditional mathematical optimization to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for resource allocation under execution uncertainty. Specifically, we establish a rigorous system model capturing execution uncertainty via Gamma-distributed computational workloads, resulting in challenging nonlinear optimization problems involving complex Gamma functions. For single-user scenarios, we design advanced block coordinate descent (BCD) and majorization-maximization (MM) algorithms, which yield semi-closed-form solutions with provable performance guarantees. However, conventional optimization approaches become computationally intractable in dynamic multi-user environments due to inter-user interference and resource contention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs enable telecom automation but face deployment challenges balancing cost, latency, and reliability. Need to optimize automated decision-making while ensuring alignment with expert judgments.

Method: Three-tier cascaded system: efficient edge model for routine queries, cloud model for complex cases, human experts when needed. Formulate misalignment-cost constrained optimization problem. Use multiple hypothesis testing for threshold selection in query processing with knowledge and confidence tests.

Result: Method achieves superior cost-efficiency compared to conventional cascaded baselines on TeleQnA dataset, while ensuring reliability at prescribed confidence levels with finite-sample guarantees.

Conclusion: The proposed cascaded LLM system with statistical threshold selection provides practical solution for telecom automation, balancing cost efficiency with guaranteed reliability through rigorous misalignment risk control.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as key enablers of automation in domains such as telecommunications, assisting with tasks including troubleshooting, standards interpretation, and network optimization. However, their deployment in practice must balance inference cost, latency, and reliability. In this work, we study an edge-cloud-expert cascaded LLM-based knowledge system that supports decision-making through a question-and-answer pipeline. In it, an efficient edge model handles routine queries, a more capable cloud model addresses complex cases, and human experts are involved only when necessary. We define a misalignment-cost constrained optimization problem, aiming to minimize average processing cost, while guaranteeing alignment of automated answers with expert judgments. We propose a statistically rigorous threshold selection method based on multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) for a query processing mechanism based on knowledge and confidence tests. The approach provides finite-sample guarantees on misalignment risk. Experiments on the TeleQnA dataset -- a telecom-specific benchmark -- demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior cost-efficiency compared to conventional cascaded baselines, while ensuring reliability at prescribed confidence levels.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: MRIS-assisted ISAC system with movable RIS sub-surface enhances physical layer security against eavesdroppers using radar signals as artificial noise, with joint optimization of beamforming, phase shifts, and sub-surface positions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional static RIS architectures lack flexibility for adaptive beam control in multi-user ISAC scenarios. Need dynamic reconfiguration without additional hardware complexity and power consumption.

Method: Propose movable RIS (MRIS) architecture with large fixed sub-surface and smaller movable sub-surface. Jointly optimize transmit beamforming vectors, MRIS phase shifts, and relative positions of sub-surfaces to maximize minimum secrecy rate under imperfect sensing estimation. Use convex bound for Eve channel uncertainty, S-procedure for semi-infinite constraints, and alternating optimization with penalty dual decomposition algorithm.

Result: MRIS architecture substantially improves secrecy performance, especially with small number of elements allocated to movable sub-surface. Achieves robust secrecy for weakest user under Eve channel uncertainty.

Conclusion: MRIS provides flexible beam reconfiguration for ISAC systems without additional hardware complexity, significantly enhancing physical layer security against eavesdroppers through joint optimization framework.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been extensively applied in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems due to the capability of enhancing physical layer security (PLS). However, conventional static RIS architectures lack the flexibility required for adaptive beam control in multi-user and multifunctional scenarios. To address this issue without introducing additional hardware complexity and power consumption, in this paper, we exploit a movable RIS (MRIS) architecture, which consists of a large fixed sub-surface and a smaller movable sub-surface that slides on the fixed sub-surface to achieve dynamic beam reconfiguration with static phase shifts. This paper investigates an MRIS-assisted ISAC system under imperfect sensing estimation, where dedicated radar signals serve as artificial noise to enhance secure transmission against potential eavesdroppers (Eves). The transmit beamforming vectors, MRIS phase shifts, and relative positions of the two sub-surfaces are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum secrecy rate, ensuring robust secrecy performance for the weakest user under the uncertainty of the Eves' channels. To handle the non-convexity, a convex bound is derived for the Eve channel uncertainty, and the S-procedure is employed to reformulate semi-infinite constraints as linear matrix inequalities. An efficient alternating optimization and penalty dual decomposition-based algorithm is developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MRIS architecture substantially improves secrecy performance, especially when only a small number of elements are allocated to the movable sub-surface.

*Lebin Chen,Ming-Min Zhao,Qingqing Wu,Min-Jian Zhao,Rui Zhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: MA-enabled anti-jamming optimization using joint antenna positioning and MVDR beamforming to maximize SINR against unknown jammers, with novel PTRSO algorithm for convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legitimate uplink systems face jamming attacks from multiple jammers with unknown channels, requiring enhanced anti-jamming capabilities. Movable antennas offer spatial degrees of freedom to combat jamming, but optimization is challenging due to unknown interference covariance and nonlinear dependence on antenna positions.

Method: Proposed a two-timescale framework: 1) Surrogate objective using sample covariance at current anchor position, updated per block; 2) MVDR beamformer adapted per snapshot. Developed PTRSO algorithm with trust-region constraints and projection to maintain locality and feasibility, proven to converge to stationary points near anchor.

Result: Established theoretical bounds on surrogate-objective discrepancy using matrix concentration inequalities, identified geometric bias in historical-averaging surrogates. Numerical results show PTRSO consistently achieves higher output SINR than baselines, verifying effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: The PTRSO algorithm successfully addresses MA-enabled anti-jamming optimization with unknown jamming channels, providing practical solution with convergence guarantees and superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a movable antenna (MA) enabled anti-jamming optimization problem, where a legitimate uplink system is exposed to multiple jammers with unknown jamming channels. To enhance the anti-jamming capability of the considered system, an MA array is deployed at the receiver, and the antenna positions and the minimum-variance distortionless-response (MVDR) receive beamformer are jointly optimized to maximize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The main challenge arises from the fact that the interference covariance matrix is unknown and nonlinearly dependent on the antenna positions. To overcome these issues, we propose a surrogate objective by replacing the unknown covariance with the sample covariance evaluated at the current antenna position anchor. Under a two-timescale framework, the surrogate objective is updated once per block (contains multiple snapshots) at the current anchor position, while the MVDR beamformer is adapted on a per-snapshot basis. We establish a local bound on the discrepancy between the surrogate and the true objective by leveraging matrix concentration inequalities, and further prove that a natural historical-averaging surrogate suffers from a non-vanishing geometric bias. Building on these insights, we develop a low-complexity projected trust-region (TR) surrogate optimization (PTRSO) algorithm that maintains the locality of each iteration via TR constraints and enforces feasibility through projection, which is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point near the anchor. Numerical results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PTRSO algorithm, which consistently achieves higher output SINR than existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While ISAC systems have been extensively studied in simulations for joint communication and environmental sensing, there is a gap in experimental validation of Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) effectiveness using real-world cellular radio units. Most existing work remains theoretical, lacking practical demonstrations with commercial hardware.

Method: The authors developed an ATR solution using a Deep Learning-based detector that directly infers target classes from radar images generated by the ISAC system.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate accurate classification performance, proving the feasibility of ATR for ISAC systems using cellular hardware in their specific setup. The study successfully bridges the gap between theoretical simulations and practical implementation.

Conclusion: The paper confirms the feasibility of ATR for ISAC with cellular hardware, but also identifies open generalization challenges that need to be addressed in future work. The findings provide a foundation for further research on practical ISAC implementations.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems enable cellular networks to jointly operate as communication technology and sense the environment. While opportunities and potential performance have been largely investigated in simulations, few experimental works have showcased Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) effectiveness in a real-world deployment based on cellular radio units. To bridge this gap, this paper presents an initial study investigating the feasibility of ATR for ISAC. Our ATR solution uses a Deep Learning (DL)-based detector to infer the target class directly from the radar images generated by the ISAC system. The DL detector is evaluated with experimental data from a ISAC testbed based on commercially available mmWave radio units in the ARENA 2036 industrial research campus located in Stuttgart, Germany.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Goal-oriented communications using programmable metasurfaces to perform edge inference directly in the wireless channel, treating the entire system as a trainable neural network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond Shannon-based communications where data must be reconstructed, and instead enable direct inference at the edge by leveraging the wireless channel for computations, reducing energy consumption and computational overhead.

Method: Treats the transmitter, receiver, and metasurface-based channel as a single deep neural network (Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Network - MINN) trained through backpropagation. Uses Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM) to perform computations over data directly in the channel.

Result: MINN achieves performance comparable to fully digital neural networks across various system parameters and datasets, while offering energy benefits from reduced computations at transceivers and lower transmission power requirements.

Conclusion: Programmable metasurfaces enable goal-oriented communications where the wireless channel itself performs computations, creating an efficient alternative to traditional communication paradigms for edge inference applications.

Abstract: Goal-oriented communications offer an attractive alternative to the Shannon-based communication paradigm, where the data is never reconstructed at the Receiver (RX) side. Rather, focusing on the case of edge inference, the Transmitter (TX) and the RX cooperate to exchange features of the input data that will be used to predict an unseen attribute of them, leveraging information from collected data sets. This chapter demonstrates that the wireless channel can be used to perform computations over the data, when equipped with programmable metasurfaces. The end-to-end system of the TX, RX, and MS-based channel is treated as a single deep neural network which is trained through backpropagation to perform inference on unseen data. Using Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM), it is shown that this Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Network (MINN) can achieve performance comparable to fully digital neural networks under various system parameters and data sets. By offloading computations onto the channel itself, important benefits may be achieved in terms of energy consumption, arising from reduced computations at the transceivers and smaller transmission power required for successful inference.

*Simon Hellmann,Terrance Wilms,Stefan Streif,Sören Weinrich*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper develops a multirate extended Kalman filter (MR-EKF) using sample state augmentation to handle delayed offline measurements in biotechnological processes, specifically applied to anaerobic digestion for biogas production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In biotechnology applications, measurements come at different sampling rates with unknown delays from offline lab analysis, creating challenges for standard Kalman filtering which assumes equidistant time grids and no delays.

Method: Derived a multirate version of extended Kalman filter (MR-EKF) based on sample state augmentation approach to handle delayed offline measurements and different sampling rates.

Result: MR-EKF reliably estimates process states, appropriately fuses delayed offline measurements, and smooths noisy online measurements. Delay length doesn't critically impair performance if observability is maintained. Poor initialization and plant-model mismatch affect convergence more than measurement noise.

Conclusion: The study provides implementation guidance for practitioners applying state estimation to multirate systems, contributing to demand-driven biogas plant operation for stabilizing renewable electricity grids.

Abstract: In many applications of biotechnology, measurements are available at different sampling rates, e.g., due to online sensors and offline lab analysis. Offline measurements typically involve time delays that may be unknown a priori due to the underlying laboratory procedures. This multirate (MR) setting poses a challenge to Kalman filtering, where conventionally measurement data is assumed to be available on an equidistant time grid and without delays. The present study derives the MR version of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based on sample state augmentation, and applies it to the anaerobic digestion (AD) process in a simulative agricultural setting. The performance of the MR-EKF is investigated for various scenarios, i.e., varying delay lengths, measurement noise levels, plant-model mismatch (PMM), and initial state error. Provided with an adequate tuning, the MR-EKF could be demonstrated to reliably estimate the process state, to appropriately fuse delayed offline measurements, and to smooth noisy online measurements well. Because of the sample state augmentation approach, the delay length of offline measurements does not critically impair state estimation performance, provided observability is not lost during the delays. Poor state initialization and PMM affect convergence more than measurement noise levels. Further, selecting an appropriate tuning was found to be critically important for successful application of the MR-EKF, for which a systematic approach is presented. This study provides implementation guidance for practitioners aiming at successfully applying state estimation for multirate systems. It thereby contributes to develop demand-driven operation of biogas plants, which may aid in stabilizing a renewable electricity grid.

Abstract: Advances in LLMs have produced agents with knowledge and operational capabilities comparable to human scientists, suggesting potential to assist, accelerate, and automate research. However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios.

TL;DR: A bi-objective optimization approach for post-disaster relief distribution that balances efficiency (travel time) and equity (Gini-index-based fairness) using a branch-and-price algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-disaster relief distribution faces challenges when prepositioned supplies are insufficient to meet all shelter demands, requiring careful planning to balance timely delivery with fair allocation of limited resources.

Method: Formulated a bi-objective MIP model minimizing both Gini-index-based inequity in unsatisfied demand and total travel time, used ε-constraint method, derived mathematical properties for valid inequalities, developed algorithm for optimal delivery allocations, and implemented branch-and-price algorithm.

Result: Branch-and-price algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers, reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency, and provides insights on when to prioritize demand coverage vs. fairness based on time constraints.

Conclusion: For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes; lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage is effective when time constraints are very loose or tight.

Abstract: The distribution of relief supplies to shelters is a critical aspect of post-disaster humanitarian logistics. In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can simulate human behavior in economic games using interpolative decoding to represent personality dimensions, enabling controlled experiments without creating separate prompts for each personality profile.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs can emulate human behaviors for testing behavioral hypotheses, current methods require creating separate prompts for each personality profile, which introduces experimental overhead and reduces replicability.

Method: Use interpolative decoding to represent personality dimensions as pairs of opposed prompts with interpolation parameters, allowing simulation of behavior along personality continua without creating individual prompts for each profile.

Result: Interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along Big Five personality dimensions, replicates human decision-making in economic games, and enables "twinning" of individual human players through systematic search in interpolation space.

Conclusion: Interpolative decoding provides an efficient, replicable method for using LLMs to simulate human personality and decision-making in behavioral experiments, overcoming limitations of prompt-based approaches.

Abstract: Recent research has explored using very large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans in tasks such as simulation, surveys, and studies. While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.

Conclusion: The prototype-guided segmentation ViT approach successfully enables domain adaptation from single-species to multi-label classification, achieving competitive results in the PlantCLEF benchmark with potential for further improvement.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach developed to address the PlantClef 2025 challenge, which consists of a fine-grained multi-label species identification, over high-resolution images. Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331. Besides that, in absolute terms our method scored 0.03 lower than the top-performing submission, suggesting that it may achieved competitive performance in the benchmark task.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel method for Fine-Grained Visual Categorization that uses class-wise clustering to create pseudo-labels encoding latent similarity between images, enabling hierarchical classification to learn more fine-grained features and mitigate intra-class variability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intra-class variability in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization tasks can hinder deep learning models, especially when classes are underrepresented. The paper aims to address this challenge by developing a method to learn more discriminative fine-grained features.

Method: The method applies clustering over each class individually to discover pseudo-labels that encode latent similarity between images. These pseudo-labels are then used in a hierarchical classification process to learn more fine-grained visual features, thereby mitigating intra-class variability.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset, even though some components haven't been fully optimized. Initial experiments revealed key points for future development to find more conclusive evidence regarding the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical classification approach using class-wise clustering shows promise for improving FGVC performance by learning more fine-grained features and addressing intra-class variability, with state-of-the-art results on PlantNet300k and code publicly available.

Abstract: Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

*Zhe Sun,Xueyuan Yang,Yujie Lu,Zhenliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S³IT benchmark evaluates embodied social intelligence by testing agents' ability to arrange seating in 3D environments considering both social norms and physical constraints, revealing LLMs' spatial intelligence deficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations fail to integrate social reasoning with physical constraints - they either test disembodied social reasoning or socially-agnostic physical tasks, missing the crucial integration needed for real-world embodied agents.

Method: Created S³IT benchmark with procedurally extensible framework generating diverse seat-ordering scenarios where agents must: 1) acquire NPC preferences through active dialogue, 2) perceive environment via autonomous exploration, and 3) perform multi-objective optimization within complex constraint networks.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs struggle with S³IT, showing significant gap compared to human baseline. LLMs demonstrate deficiencies in spatial intelligence but achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts with explicit textual cues.

Conclusion: S³IT successfully identifies gaps in LLMs' embodied social intelligence, particularly spatial reasoning deficiencies, while highlighting their strengths in text-based conflict resolution, providing a valuable benchmark for developing more capable embodied agents.

Abstract: The integration of embodied agents into human environments demands embodied social intelligence: reasoning over both social norms and physical constraints. However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LieFlow: A method for discovering symmetries in data via flow matching on Lie groups, enabling flexible discovery of discrete and continuous symmetries without strong assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symmetry is fundamental to physics and improves ML performance, but requires knowledge of underlying symmetries in data. Current methods lack flexibility and require strong assumptions about symmetry types.

Method: Formulates symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group via flow matching on Lie groups. Introduces novel interpolation scheme to address "last-minute convergence" problem where symmetric target modes cause samples to remain stationary until late in flow.

Result: Successfully discovers discrete groups (including reflections) via flow matching over complex domain in experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds. Method is more flexible than previous works and requires fewer assumptions.

Conclusion: LieFlow provides an effective approach for learning symmetries directly from data, addressing key challenges in symmetry discovery and enabling more flexible discovery of both discrete and continuous symmetry groups.

Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to understanding physical systems, and at the same time, can improve performance and sample efficiency in machine learning. Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.

TL;DR: SOF learns latent skills from action-free videos using optical flow as intermediate representation, enabling high-level planning and better action translation for robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generative models produce good visual predictions but are hard to translate into low-level actions, while latent-action models lack high-level planning capabilities. There's a need to bridge this gap between video understanding and actionable robot skills.

Method: SOF learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos using optical flow as an intermediate representation. The optical flow captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions, creating a flow-based latent skill space that enables high-level planning.

Result: Experiments show consistent performance improvements in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

Conclusion: SOF successfully bridges the gap between video understanding and actionable robot skills by learning latent skills through optical flow representation, enabling effective high-level planning and skill composition from visual data.

Abstract: Learning from videos offers a promising path toward generalist robots by providing rich visual and temporal priors beyond what real robot datasets contain. While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

TL;DR: ProbGLC: A probabilistic cross-view geolocalization approach that combines probabilistic and deterministic models to enhance explainability and achieve state-of-the-art performance for rapid disaster response.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change is increasing frequency and intensity of disasters, requiring rapid response. Accurate and quick identification of disaster locations is crucial for decision-making and resource allocation in disaster response.

Method: ProbGLC combines probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework, providing uncertainty quantification and localizability scores. It addresses cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events.

Result: Achieves superior geolocalization accuracy: 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km on MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster datasets. Provides model explainability through probabilistic distributions and localizability scores.

Conclusion: ProbGLC demonstrates great potential for leveraging generative cross-view approaches to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response, with publicly available code and data.

Abstract: As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

TL;DR: RL scaling for content moderation shows sigmoid-like performance gains with increased data/steps, achieving 100x data efficiency over supervised fine-tuning for complex policy reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Content moderation at scale is challenging due to billions of user/AI-generated artifacts needing policy evaluation. While LLMs show potential, practical challenges like label sparsity, evolving policies, and need for nuanced reasoning beyond pattern matching remain unexplored in real-world settings.

Method: Comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling RL for content classification, evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks to transform general-purpose language models into specialized policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks.

Result: RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior where performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before saturating. RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: RL is particularly effective for content moderation in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly, providing actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems.

Abstract: Content moderation at scale remains one of the most pressing challenges in today's digital ecosystem, where billions of user- and AI-generated artifacts must be continuously evaluated for policy violations. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.

TL;DR: Reason2Decide: A two-stage training framework for clinical decision support that improves prediction accuracy and explanation alignment by addressing exposure bias through scheduled sampling and joint training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clinical decision support systems using LLMs struggle with achieving both high predictive accuracy and generating explanations that properly align with predictions, suffering from exposure bias that leads to misaligned explanations.

Method: Two-stage training framework: Stage-1 trains on rationale generation only; Stage-2 jointly trains on label prediction and rationale generation using scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions.

Result: Outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs across three medical datasets in both prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity metrics (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). Shows robustness across different rationale sources and works with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models.

Conclusion: Reason2Decide effectively addresses exposure bias in self-rationalization, enables use of LLM-generated rationales for pretraining to reduce human annotation needs, and makes clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while providing explainable decision support.

Abstract: Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.

TL;DR: An adaptive framework combining LLMs with market feedback for financial sentiment analysis, using instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2, RAG, and reinforcement learning to improve sentiment classification aligned with actual stock returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial sentiment analysis methods ignore the impact of stock prices and market feedback on sentiment classification, creating a gap between sentiment predictions and actual market behavior.

Method: 1) Fine-tune LLaMA 3.2 3B using instruction-based learning on SentiFin dataset; 2) Implement RAG pipeline with dynamic multi-source contextual information selection via cosine similarity; 3) Add feedback-driven module adjusting source reliability based on sentiment-return alignment; 4) Incorporate PPO reinforcement learning agent to optimize source weighting policies across temporal data.

Result: Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines (2024-2025) show significant improvements in classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling that adapts to real-world market behavior.

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MolAct is an agentic reinforcement learning framework for molecular design that treats editing and optimization as sequential, tool-guided decisions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on molecular editing and optimization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular editing and optimization require iterative improvements while maintaining chemical validity and structural similarity, which are multi-step problems not well-addressed by existing approaches. The authors aim to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem where LLM agents can interleave reasoning, tool-use, and optimization.

Method: MolAct uses a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing learned editing behaviors. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages feedback to refine subsequent edits. Two model families are instantiated: MolEditAgent for editing tasks and MolOptAgent for optimization tasks.

Result: MolEditAgent-7B achieves 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed "thinking" baselines like DeepSeek-R1. MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open models like Qwen3-32B-think. MolOptAgent-7B surpasses the best closed baseline (Claude 3.7) on LogP optimization and remains competitive on solubility while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives.

Conclusion: Treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements. The agentic reinforcement learning approach enables effective interleaving of reasoning, tool-use, and optimization for molecular design tasks.

Abstract: Molecular editing and optimization are multi-step problems that require iteratively improving properties while keeping molecules chemically valid and structurally similar. We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed "thinking" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open "thinking" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed "thinking" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements.

*Xingyou Yin,Ceyao Zhang,Min Hu,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simple noise injection strategy to improve zero-shot time series forecasting with frozen LLMs by making them focus on robust temporal patterns rather than numerical artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot TS forecasting with frozen LLMs is brittle due to sensitivity to textual representations of numerical data, as LLM parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. The goal is to improve performance without any fine-tuning.

Method: Inject noise into raw time series before tokenization as a form of inference-time augmentation. This non-invasive intervention forces frozen LLMs to extrapolate based on underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts.

Result: Empirical validation across diverse benchmarks shows improved performance. To eliminate data contamination biases, the authors introduce two novel TS datasets outside LLMs' pre-training scopes and consistently observe performance improvements.

Conclusion: Noise injection provides an effective strategy for leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting without fine-tuning, advancing the paradigm of truly frozen LLM applications in TS forecasting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.

Motivation: Data centers consume significant global energy with growing demand from edge computing and AI. Improving energy efficiency through PUE prediction helps combat climate change, reduce costs, and promote sustainability.

Method: Developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) model for PUE prediction, using Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) for feature selection from 117 features. Compared with GRU model using MSE, MAE, and R-squared metrics on EnergyPlus simulated data from Singapore DC.

Result: BiGRU-based PUE prediction model achieved better performance than GRU model across evaluation metrics (MSE, MAE, R-squared), demonstrating improved accuracy in predicting data center energy efficiency.

Conclusion: BiGRU model provides superior PUE prediction for data center energy management, enabling targeted feature modifications to improve energy efficiency and support sustainability goals.

Abstract: Data centers account for significant global energy consumption and a carbon footprint. The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model. The performance of the optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is then compared with that of GRU using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

Motivation: To compare human and LLM generalization capabilities in mathematical concept inference tasks, specifically examining their inductive biases and inference strategies using the number game as a testbed.

Method: Used a Bayesian model as an analytical framework to examine inductive biases and inference strategies of humans and LLMs in the number game concept inference task.

Result: Humans were better captured by the Bayesian model than LLMs, showing flexible inference of both rule-based and similarity-based concepts, while LLMs relied more on mathematical rules. Humans demonstrated effective few-shot generalization from single examples, whereas LLMs required more samples.

Conclusion: There are fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts, with humans showing more flexible, sample-efficient reasoning compared to LLMs' more rigid, rule-focused approach.

Abstract: We compare human and large language model (LLM) generalization in the number game, a concept inference task. Using a Bayesian model as an analytical framework, we examined the inductive biases and inference strategies of humans and LLMs. The Bayesian model captured human behavior better than LLMs in that humans flexibly infer rule-based and similarity-based concepts, whereas LLMs rely more on mathematical rules. Humans also demonstrated a few-shot generalization, even from a single example, while LLMs required more samples to generalize. These contrasts highlight the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts.

TL;DR: Offline PbRL learns rewards/policies from human preferences but faces safety challenges. PreSa directly learns safe policies from preferences and safety labels without explicit reward/cost models, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline Preference-based RL avoids reward engineering but struggles with safety. Existing safe RLHF methods learn reward/cost models then use constrained RL, which accumulates errors in long-horizon tasks, impairing performance.

Method: PreSa framework: (a) learns policy directly from pairwise preferences (reward) and binary safety labels, (b) combines preference learning with safety alignment in constrained optimization via Lagrangian, avoiding explicit reward/cost models and constrained RL, (c) evaluated on continuous control tasks with synthetic/real human feedback.

Result: Method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.

Conclusion: Direct policy learning from preferences and safety labels via PreSa framework effectively addresses safety challenges in offline PbRL, avoiding error accumulation from explicit reward/cost modeling and constrained RL.

Abstract: Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) learns rewards and policies aligned with human preferences without the need for extensive reward engineering and direct interaction with human annotators. However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advances, especially in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), research focus is shifting from single-modality text processing to the more complex domains of multimodal and embodied AI. Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents. TongSIM offers practical advantages by providing over 100 diverse, multi-room indoor scenarios as well as an open-ended, interaction-rich outdoor town simulation, ensuring broad applicability across research needs. Its comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarks enable precise assessment of agent capabilities, such as perception, cognition, decision-making, human-robot cooperation, and spatial and social reasoning. With features like customized scenes, task-adaptive fidelity, diverse agent types, and dynamic environmental simulation, TongSIM delivers flexibility and scalability for researchers, serving as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence.

### [107] [MemR$^3$: Memory Retrieval via Reflective Reasoning for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20237)
*Xingbo Du,Loka Li,Duzhen Zhang,Le Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MemR³ is a memory retrieval system for LLM agents with closed-loop control that autonomously decides between retrieve, reflect, and answer actions, outperforming existing memory systems on question answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory systems for LLM agents focus too much on compression and storage optimization, with insufficient emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval processes.

Method: Two core mechanisms: 1) A router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) A global evidence-gap tracker that makes the answering process transparent and tracks evidence collection.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on LoCoMo benchmark using LLM-as-a-Judge score. Improves existing retrievers across four categories with overall improvements: RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend.

Conclusion: MemR³ offers a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores, introducing closed-loop control that enables autonomous decision-making in memory retrieval, departing from standard retrieve-then-answer pipelines.

Abstract: Memory systems have been designed to leverage past experiences in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.

*Divya Vijay,Vignesh Ethiraj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: G-SPEC is a neuro-symbolic framework that combines LLM agents with deterministic verification using Network Knowledge Graphs and SHACL constraints to ensure safe intent-based networking in 5G/6G orchestration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As networks evolve to 5G Standalone and 6G, operators face orchestration challenges beyond static automation and DRL capabilities. LLM agents offer intent-based networking but introduce stochastic risks like topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance.

Method: Proposes Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. Uses a Governance Triad: telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints for validation.

Result: Evaluated on simulated 450-node 5G Core: achieved zero safety violations and 94.1% remediation success rate (vs 82.4% baseline). NKG validation contributed 68% of safety gains, SHACL policies 24%. Scalable to 10K-100K nodes with O(k^1.2) validation latency and 142ms processing overhead.

Conclusion: G-SPEC effectively mitigates LLM agent risks in network orchestration through deterministic verification, making it viable for SMO-layer operations in 5G/6G networks with proven safety and scalability.

Abstract: As networks evolve toward 5G Standalone and 6G, operators face orchestration challenges that exceed the limits of static automation and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Although Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a path toward intent-based networking, they introduce stochastic risks, including topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance. To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline. Ablation analysis indicates that NKG validation drives the majority of safety gains (68%), followed by SHACL policies (24%). Scalability tests on topologies ranging from 10K to 100K nodes demonstrate that validation latency scales as $O(k^{1.2})$ where $k$ is subgraph size. With a processing overhead of 142ms, G-SPEC is viable for SMO-layer operations.

### [109] [ActionFlow: A Pipelined Action Acceleration for Vision Language Models on Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20276)
*Yuntao Dai,Hang Gu,Teng Wang,Qianyu Cheng,Yifei Zheng,Zhiyong Qiu,Lei Gong,Wenqi Lou,Xuehai Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ActionFlow is a system-level inference framework that accelerates Vision-Language-Action models on edge devices by 2.55x through cross-request pipelining and memory optimization, enabling real-time robotic control without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models suffer from high inference latency (3-5 Hz) on edge devices due to memory-bound autoregressive decoding, which is insufficient for smooth robotic interaction requiring 20-30 Hz control frequencies. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise accuracy.

Method: ActionFlow introduces: 1) Cross-Request Pipelining strategy that batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps; 2) Cross-Request State Packed Forward operator; and 3) Unified KV Ring Buffer to fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations.

Result: ActionFlow achieves 2.55x improvement in FPS on OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dynamic manipulation on edge hardware by reaching the required 20-30 Hz control frequencies.

Conclusion: ActionFlow successfully bridges the performance gap for VLA models on edge platforms through system-level optimizations that maximize hardware utilization without compromising model accuracy or requiring retraining, making real-time robotic control feasible.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

### [110] [Synthesizing Procedural Memory: Challenges and Architectures in Automated Workflow Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20278)
*Nishant Gaurav,Adit Akarsh,Ankit Ranjan,Manoj Bajaj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs transition from passive tool-users to active workflow architects by autonomously synthesizing executable code skills through a scientific methodology, addressing four structural bottlenecks in automated skill generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While CodeMem shows executable code is optimal for agentic procedural memory, the mechanism for autonomously synthesizing this memory from scratch remains underexplored. The paper aims to operationalize LLMs' transition from passive tool-users to active workflow architects.

Method: Through a high-fidelity case study of cross-service orchestration (Outlook and OneDrive), the paper identifies and addresses four structural bottlenecks: Discovery Gap (navigating large tool registries), Verification Gap (grounding tool response structures), Decomposition Gap (replacing inefficient search with Linear State Anchoring), and Scaling Gap (concurrency and persistence). The approach enforces a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code.

Result: The paper demonstrates that agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills by addressing these bottlenecks and applying the scientific methodology.

Conclusion: LLMs can successfully transition from passive tool-users to active workflow architects capable of autonomously synthesizing executable code skills, overcoming key structural bottlenecks in automated skill generation through systematic methodology.

Abstract: While CodeMem establishes executable code as the optimal representation for agentic procedural memory, the mechanism for autonomously synthesizing this memory from a blank slate remains underexplored. This paper operationalizes the transition of Large Language Models from passive tool-users to active workflow architects. Through a high-fidelity case study of a cross-service orchestration task involving Outlook and OneDrive, we identify and address four structural bottlenecks in automated skill generation: the Discovery Gap involving navigation of large tool registries, the Verification Gap regarding grounding tool response structures, the Decomposition Gap which replaces inefficient search with Linear State Anchoring, and the Scaling Gap focused on concurrency and persistence. We demonstrate that by enforcing a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code, agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills.

### [111] [SynCraft: Guiding Large Language Models to Predict Edit Sequences for Molecular Synthesizability Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20333)
*Junren Li,Luhua Lai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SynCraft is a reasoning-based AI framework that uses LLMs to optimize molecular synthesizability through precise structural editing rather than sequence translation, outperforming existing methods in generating synthesizable analogs while preserving structural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative AI for molecular discovery faces a bottleneck where many generated molecules are synthetically inaccessible. Existing solutions like post-hoc filtering or template-based methods often compromise structural novelty or disrupt important pharmacophores.

Method: SynCraft reframes synthesizability optimization as a structural editing problem rather than sequence translation. It leverages LLMs' reasoning capabilities to predict executable sequences of atom-level edits, using interaction-aware prompting to navigate the "synthesis cliff" where minimal modifications yield significant synthetic feasibility gains.

Result: Extensive benchmarks show SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. It successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescues previously discarded RIPK1 candidates from molecular generation literature.

Conclusion: SynCraft represents a novel approach to molecular synthesizability optimization that combines LLM reasoning with precise structural editing, effectively addressing the synthetic accessibility bottleneck while preserving molecular novelty and pharmacophore integrity.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has revolutionized the exploration of chemical space, yet a critical bottleneck remains that a substantial fraction of generated molecules is synthetically inaccessible. Current solutions, such as post-hoc filtering or projection-based methods, often compromise structural novelty or disrupt key pharmacophores by forcing molecules into pre-defined synthetic templates. Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the "synthesis cliff" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures.

Our system outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray report generation models in automated report generation, surpassing even larger-scale models including ChatGPT 4o (200B parameters), while demonstrating reliable detection of six clinically critical radiographic findings. Retrospective evaluation confirms significantly higher report accuracy than Janus-Pro and ChatGPT 4o. In prospective clinical deployment, AI assistance significantly improved report quality scores, reduced interpretation time by 18.3% (P < 0.001), and was preferred by a majority of experts in 54.3% of cases. Through lightweight architecture and domain-specific optimization, Janus-Pro-CXR improves diagnostic reliability and workflow efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The model architecture and implementation framework will be open-sourced to facilitate the clinical translation of AI-assisted radiology solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable cross-modal reasoning for industrial simulation systems by integrating visual reasoning and language understanding into executable simulation code generation.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for generative digital twins that integrate visual reasoning and language understanding into executable industrial simulation systems.

Abstract: We propose a Vision-Language Simulation Model (VLSM) that unifies visual and textual understanding to synthesize executable FlexScript from layout sketches and natural-language prompts, enabling cross-modal reasoning for industrial simulation systems. To support this new paradigm, the study constructs the first large-scale dataset for generative digital twins, comprising over 120,000 prompt-sketch-code triplets that enable multimodal learning between textual descriptions, spatial structures, and simulation logic. In parallel, three novel evaluation metrics, Structural Validity Rate (SVR), Parameter Match Rate (PMR), and Execution Success Rate (ESR), are proposed specifically for this task to comprehensively evaluate structural integrity, parameter fidelity, and simulator executability. Through systematic ablation across vision encoders, connectors, and code-pretrained language backbones, the proposed models achieve near-perfect structural accuracy and high execution robustness. This work establishes a foundation for generative digital twins that integrate visual reasoning and language understanding into executable industrial simulation systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bohrium+SciMaster is an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach for scaling AI-driven scientific workflows, enabling agentic science through managed AI4S assets and orchestration of long-horizon scientific processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift toward agentic science at scale is necessary as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses traditional peer-review pipelines, requiring better traceability and credible evaluation. Current challenges include: workflows being hard to observe/reproduce, tools not being agent-ready, execution being hard to trace/govern, and bespoke AI Scientist systems limiting reuse and systematic improvement.

Method: Bohrium+SciMaster stack: Bohrium acts as a managed hub for AI4S assets (like HuggingFace for AI for Science), turning scientific data, software, compute, and lab systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon workflows. A "scientific intelligence substrate" organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action.

Result: Demonstrated with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.

Conclusion: Scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach that enables composition, auditability, and improvement through use, moving beyond bespoke AI Scientist systems toward systematic, traceable scientific workflows.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a practical way to run multi-step scientific workflows that interleave reasoning with tool use and verification, pointing to a shift from isolated AI-assisted steps toward \emph{agentic science at scale}. This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.
  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.
  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.
  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs (GatorTron-Base, Llama 8B, Mistral 7B) compared to SLMs (BioBERT, DocBERT, etc.) for shock prediction in ICU patients; LLMs not inherently superior despite GatorTron-Base achieving 80.5% weighted recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs have transformed NLP tasks, their application in clinical predictive tasks remains under-researched. Timely shock prediction in critically ill patients could enable early interventions and improve outcomes.

Method: Used MIMIC III database with 17,294 ICU stays, scoring patients for length of stay >24h and shock index >0.7 (355 normal, 87 abnormal SI). Compared LLMs (GatorTron-Base, Llama 8B, Mistral 7B) against SLMs (BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec). Applied focal and cross-entropy losses to address class imbalance during fine-tuning.

Result: GatorTron-Base achieved highest weighted recall of 80.5%, but overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. LLMs not inherently superior to SLMs for clinical event prediction despite strong text-based task performance.

Conclusion: Future LLM training should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks like named entity recognition or phenotyping to achieve meaningful clinical outcomes.

Abstract: With the advent of LLMs, various tasks across the natural language processing domain have been transformed. However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the gap in teacher sentiment analysis by creating a comprehensive multimodal dataset and developing an effective model that accounts for the performative nature of teaching and instructional context, advancing the field of educational emotion analysis.

Abstract: Teachers' emotional states are critical in educational scenarios, profoundly impacting teaching efficacy, student engagement, and learning achievements. However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly. We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification.

TL;DR: Chain-of-thought reasoning in LLM-based SRS planning agent improves plan quality and transparency while matching human performance on key metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption in stereotactic radiosurgery due to opacity concerns, creating a need for transparent, explainable automated planning systems.

Method: Developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent with two variants: non-reasoning and reasoning models. Tested on retrospective cohort of 41 brain metastasis patients treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS, comparing plan quality against human planners.

Result: Reasoning model achieved comparable dosimetry to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, max dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). Reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including 457 instances of constraint verification and 609 instances of trade-off deliberation, while standard model showed minimal deliberative processes.

Conclusion: Chain-of-thought reasoning enables transparent, auditable automated SRS planning that matches human performance while providing explainable decision-making processes through optimization traces that serve as audit logs.

Abstract: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) demands precise dose shaping around critical structures, yet black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption due to opacity concerns. We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent. The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning.

TL;DR: Multi-agent framework for long-video QA where a master LLM coordinates grounding and vision agents to localize relevant segments and extract visual details, trained with RL for efficient cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long-video QA compress content into lossy summaries or use limited toolsets, which weakens temporal grounding and misses fine-grained visual cues needed for accurate episode-level reasoning.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent framework with: 1) Master LLM that coordinates agents and plans with step limits, 2) Grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments, 3) Vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. Trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation.

Result: Significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines on proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ datasets (episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+). Reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning capabilities of the trained agent.

Conclusion: The multi-agent framework enables effective long-video QA by improving temporal grounding through segment localization, complementing subtitles with visual details, and producing interpretable reasoning trajectories, with RL training enhancing cooperative efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.

TL;DR: DJSCC-based downlink scheme for AI-native LEO satellite networks improves visual inference accuracy and timeliness compared to conventional SSCC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LEO satellites are crucial for mission-critical applications like disaster relief, but face downlink transmission challenges due to limited link budget, path loss, and fading. AI-native communications enable intelligent edge nodes, but reliable transmission remains constrained.

Method: Proposes deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) for AI-native LEO networks optimized for goal-oriented visual inference. DJSCC extracts and transmits only semantically meaningful features, unlike conventional separate source-channel coding (SSCC) that transmits original image data. Introduces age of misclassified information (AoMI) metric and threshold-based AoI analysis to evaluate information freshness and visual event detection performance.

Result: Simulation results show DJSCC provides higher inference accuracy, lower average AoMI, and greater threshold compliance than conventional SSCC baseline.

Conclusion: DJSCC enables semantic communication in AI-native LEO satellite networks for 6G and beyond, improving reliability and timeliness for mission-critical applications.

Abstract: Non terrestrial networks (NTNs), particularly low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems, play a vital role in supporting future mission critical applications such as disaster relief. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-native communications enable LEO satellites to act as intelligent edge nodes capable of on board learning and task oriented inference. However, the limited link budget, coupled with severe path loss and fading, significantly constrains reliable downlink transmission. This paper proposes a deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC)-based downlink scheme for AI-native LEO networks, optimized for goal-oriented visual inference. In the DJSCC approach, only semantically meaningful features are extracted and transmitted, whereas conventional separate source-channel coding (SSCC) transmits the original image data. To evaluate information freshness and visual event detection performance, this work introduces the age of misclassified information (AoMI) metric and a threshold based AoI analysis that measures the proportion of users meeting application specific timeliness requirements. Simulation results show that the proposed DJSCC scheme provides higher inference accuracy, lower average AoMI, and greater threshold compliance than the conventional SSCC baseline, enabling semantic communication in AI native LEO satellite networks for 6G and beyond.

*Antonio Tarizzo,Mohammad Kazemi,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A learned digital over-the-air framework for federated edge learning that improves recovery accuracy and robustness in low SNR regimes while maintaining the same uplink overhead as state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated edge learning suffers from communication bottlenecks due to repeated uplink transmission of model updates. While over-the-air aggregation helps by exploiting wireless superposition, current digital OTA schemes are limited in low SNR conditions.

Method: Integrates unsourced random access codebook with vector quantization and AMP-DA-Net (an unrolled approximate message passing decoder trained end-to-end with digital codebook and parameter server statistics). Extends OTA aggregation beyond averaging to symmetric functions like trimmed means and majority rules.

Result: Extends reliable digital OTA operation by more than 10 dB into low SNR regimes while matching or improving performance across full SNR range. Effective under message corruption and nonlinear aggregation with heterogeneous device datasets.

Conclusion: The learned digital OTA framework significantly improves robustness in challenging SNR conditions and demonstrates the broader potential of end-to-end learned design for digital OTA communication in federated edge learning.

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables wireless devices to collaboratively train a centralised model without sharing raw data, but repeated uplink transmission of model updates makes communication the dominant bottleneck. Over-the-air (OTA) aggregation alleviates this by exploiting the superposition property of the wireless channel, enabling simultaneous transmission and merging communication with computation. Digital OTA schemes extend this principle by incorporating the robustness of conventional digital communication, but current designs remain limited in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. This work proposes a learned digital OTA framework that improves recovery accuracy, convergence behaviour, and robustness to challenging SNR conditions while maintaining the same uplink overhead as state-of-the-art methods. The design integrates an unsourced random access (URA) codebook with vector quantisation and AMP-DA-Net, an unrolled approximate message passing (AMP)-style decoder trained end-to-end with the digital codebook and parameter server local training statistics. The proposed design extends OTA aggregation beyond averaging to a broad class of symmetric functions, including trimmed means and majority-based rules. Experiments on highly heterogeneous device datasets and varying numbers of active devices show that the proposed design extends reliable digital OTA operation by more than 10 dB into low SNR regimes while matching or improving performance across the full SNR range. The learned decoder remains effective under message corruption and nonlinear aggregation, highlighting the broader potential of end-to-end learned design for digital OTA communication in FEEL.

*Yuntong Gu,Xiangming meng,Zhiyuan Lin,Sheng Wu,Linling Kuang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A diffusion-based Bayesian framework for joint spectrum reconstruction and active sensing that uses learned diffusion priors and uncertainty-aware sampling to improve spectral efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity spectrum cartography is crucial for spectrum management but remains challenging due to sparse/irregular observations. Existing approaches decouple reconstruction from sensing and lack principled mechanisms for informative sampling.

Method: Proposes a unified diffusion-based Bayesian framework that formulates reconstruction as conditional generation with learned diffusion priors. Derives tractable posterior transition kernels for reverse diffusion that enforce consistency with both linear Gaussian and non-linear quantized measurements. Develops uncertainty-aware active sampling strategy that quantifies reconstruction uncertainty to guide sensing agents to most informative locations.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art interpolation, sparsity-based, and deep learning baselines in reconstruction accuracy, sampling efficiency, and robustness to low-bit quantization.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion-based Bayesian framework effectively addresses the joint problems of spectrum reconstruction and active sensing, providing superior performance through principled uncertainty-aware sampling and robust handling of various measurement types.

Abstract: High-fidelity spectrum cartography is pivotal for spectrum management and wireless situational awareness, yet it remains a challenging ill-posed inverse problem due to the sparsity and irregularity of observations. Furthermore, existing approaches often decouple reconstruction from sensing, lacking a principled mechanism for informative sampling. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a unified diffusion-based Bayesian framework that jointly addresses spectrum reconstruction and active sensing. We formulate the reconstruction task as a conditional generation process driven by a learned diffusion prior. Specifically, we derive tractable, closed-form posterior transition kernels for the reverse diffusion process, which enforce consistency with both linear Gaussian and non-linear quantized measurements. Leveraging the intrinsic probabilistic nature of diffusion models, we further develop an uncertainty-aware active sampling strategy. This strategy quantifies reconstruction uncertainty to adaptively guide sensing agents toward the most informative locations, thereby maximizing spectral efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art interpolation, sparsity-based, and deep learning baselines in terms of reconstruction accuracy, sampling efficiency, and robustness to low-bit quantization.

Conclusion: RIS-OTFS-FTN offers a viable solution for future high-mobility and spectrum-constrained wireless systems, combining the advantages of OTFS robustness, FTN spectral efficiency, and RIS beamforming.

Abstract: High-mobility wireless communication systems suffer from severe Doppler spread and multi-path delay, which degrade the reliability and spectral efficiency of conventional modulation schemes. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation offers strong robustness in such environments by representing symbols in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, while faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling can further enhance spectral efficiency through intentional symbol packing. Meanwhile, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) provide a promising means to improve link quality via passive beamforming. Motivated by these advantages, we propose a novel RIS-empowered OTFS modulation with FTN signaling (RIS-OTFS-FTN) scheme. First, we establish a unified DD-domain input-output relationship that jointly accounts for RIS passive beamforming, FTN-induced inter-symbol interference, and DD-domain channel characteristics. Based on this model, we provide comprehensive analytical performance for the frame error rate, spectral efficiency, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), etc. Furthermore, a practical RIS phase adjustment strategy with quantized phase selection is designed to maximize the effective channel gain. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations under a standardized extended vehicular A (EVA) channel model validate the theoretical results and provide key insights into the trade-offs among spectral efficiency, PAPR, input back-off (IBO), and error performance, with some interesting insights.The proposed RIS-OTFS-FTN scheme demonstrates notable performance gains in both reliability and spectral efficiency, offering a viable solution for future high-mobility and spectrum-constrained wireless systems.

*Victoria E. Galanopoulou,Thrassos K. Oikonomou,Odysseas G. Karagiannidis,Sotiris A. Tegos,Panagiotis D. Diamantoulakis*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes Viterbi state selection algorithm for antenna subset selection in waveguide-fed pinching antenna arrays, achieving optimal performance with polynomial complexity instead of exponential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Antenna subset selection for pinching antenna arrays is a combinatorial problem with exponential complexity, making exhaustive search impractical for large arrays. The achievable rate depends on coherent superposition of complex channel gains, which is highly sensitive to relative phase alignment.

Method: Viterbi state selection (VSS) algorithm that exploits phase structure of combined received signal. Defines trellis state as quantized representation of accumulated complex gain phase, uses Viterbi-based survivor rule to prune dominated antenna subsets across stages.

Result: Numerical results show the proposed method achieves same antenna selection and rate as exhaustive search while reducing computational complexity from exponential to polynomial in number of available antennas.

Conclusion: VSS algorithm provides optimal antenna subset selection with polynomial complexity, solving the combinatorial optimization problem efficiently for waveguide-fed pinching antenna arrays.

Abstract: Pinching antennas enable dynamic control of electromagnetic wave propagation through reconfigurable radiating structures, but selecting an optimal subset of antennas remains a combinatorial problem with exponential complexity. This letter considers antenna subset selection for a waveguide-fed pinching antenna array serving ground users under a time-division access scheme. The achievable rate depends on the coherent superposition of the effective complex channel gains and is therefore highly sensitive to the relative phase alignment of the activated antennas. To address the prohibitive complexity of exhaustive search, we propose a Viterbi state selection (VSS) algorithm that exploits the phase structure of the combined received signal. The trellis state is defined by a quantized representation of the phase of the accumulated complex gain, and a Viterbi-based survivor rule is used to prune dominated antenna subsets across stages. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the same antenna selection and rate as exhaustive search, while reducing the computational complexity from exponential to polynomial in the number of available antennas.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: PID components (unique/synergistic info) map to causal structures: unique info identifies direct causal neighbors, synergy identifies colliders in Bayesian networks, enabling local causal discovery without global graph search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current higher-order information theory tools like PID lack established mathematical connection to causal structure, limiting their application in causal discovery for multivariate systems with complex interactions beyond pairwise relations.

Method: Establishes theoretical correspondence between PID components and causal structure in Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. Shows unique information characterizes direct causal neighbors, synergy identifies collider relationships. Extends to Bayesian hypergraphs to differentiate parents, children, co-heads, and co-tails.

Result: Proves PID signatures can recover local causal structure around each variable from immediate informational footprint. Demonstrates higher-order collider effect unique to multi-tail hyperedges. Provides procedures for systematic causal structure characterization.

Conclusion: PID provides rigorous, model-agnostic foundation for inferring both pairwise and higher-order causal structure, introducing fundamentally local information-theoretic viewpoint on causal discovery that eliminates need for global graph search.

Abstract: Analyzing causality in multivariate systems involves establishing how information is generated, distributed and combined, and thus requires tools that capture interactions beyond pairwise relations. Higher-order information theory provides such tools. In particular, Partial Information Decomposition (PID) allows the decomposition of the information that a set of sources provides about a target into redundant, unique, and synergistic components. Yet the mathematical connection between such higher-order information-theoretic measures and causal structure remains undeveloped. Here we establish the first theoretical correspondence between PID components and causal structure in both Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. We first show that in Bayesian networks unique information precisely characterizes direct causal neighbors, while synergy identifies collider relationships. This establishes a localist causal discovery paradigm in which the structure surrounding each variable can be recovered from its immediate informational footprint, eliminating the need for global search over graph space. Extending these results to higher-order systems, we prove that PID signatures in Bayesian hypergraphs differentiate parents, children, co-heads, and co-tails, revealing a higher-order collider effect unique to multi-tail hyperedges. We also present procedures by which our results can be used to characterize systematically the causal structure of Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. Our results position PID as a rigorous, model-agnostic foundation for inferring both pairwise and higher-order causal structure, and introduce a fundamentally local information-theoretic viewpoint on causal discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates various machine learning approaches for human activity recognition using wearable sensors, focusing on reducing labeling requirements while maintaining accuracy. It compares six methods across the supervision spectrum and finds that weakly supervised and weakly self-supervised approaches achieve competitive performance with significantly less labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human activity recognition using wearable sensors faces a trade-off between performance and labeling requirements. Fully supervised methods need extensive labeled data (costly), while unsupervised methods have poor performance. The paper aims to find approaches that minimize labeling needs while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Method: The paper develops and compares six approaches: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) weakly supervised learning with constraints, (4) multi-task learning with knowledge sharing, (5) self-supervised approach based on domain expertise, and (6) novel weakly self-supervised learning framework that leverages domain knowledge and minimal labeled data.

Result: Experiments show: (i) weakly supervised methods achieve performance comparable to fully supervised approaches while significantly reducing supervision requirements; (ii) multi-task framework enhances performance through knowledge sharing; (iii) weakly self-supervised approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency with just 10% of labeled data.

Conclusion: The results highlight complementary strengths of different learning paradigms and show that the novel weakly self-supervised framework offers a promising solution for practical HAR applications where labeled data are limited, providing insights for tailoring solutions based on labeled data availability.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors has advanced through various machine learning paradigms, each with inherent trade-offs between performance and labeling requirements. While fully supervised techniques achieve high accuracy, they demand extensive labeled datasets that are costly to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised methods eliminate labeling needs but often deliver suboptimal performance. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation across the supervision spectrum for wearable-based HAR, with particular focus on novel approaches that minimize labeling requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy. We develop and empirically compare: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) a weakly supervised learning approach with constraints, (4) a multi-task learning approach with knowledge sharing, (5) a self-supervised approach based on domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework that leverages domain knowledge and minimal labeled data. Experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that: (i) our weakly supervised methods achieve performance comparable to fully supervised approaches while significantly reducing supervision requirements; (ii) the proposed multi-task framework enhances performance through knowledge sharing between related tasks; (iii) our weakly self-supervised approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency with just 10\% of labeled data. These results not only highlight the complementary strengths of different learning paradigms, offering insights into tailoring HAR solutions based on the availability of labeled data, but also establish that our novel weakly self-supervised framework offers a promising solution for practical HAR applications where labeled data are limited.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multimodal deep learning model using structured/unstructured clinical data predicts in-hospital mortality risk for ICU patients after first 24 hours, achieving AUROC up to 0.92 with external validation across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients can help clinicians optimize treatment decisions and resource allocation.

Method: Developed multimodal deep learning model using MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID datasets. Inputs included time-invariant variables, time-variant variables (first 24h ICU data), clinical notes, and chest X-ray images. Model was trained on MIMIC datasets and externally validated on temporally separated MIMIC population, HiRID, and eICU datasets.

Result: Model with structured data achieved AUROC 0.92, AUPRC 0.53, Brier 0.19. External validation across 8 eICU institutions showed AUROCs 0.84-0.92. Adding clinical notes and imaging improved AUROC from 0.87 to 0.89, AUPRC from 0.43 to 0.48, and Brier from 0.37 to 0.17. Total 203,434 ICU admissions from 200+ hospitals (2001-2022) with mortality rates 5.2%-7.9%.

Conclusion: Incorporating multiple sources of patient information (structured data, clinical notes, imaging) improves mortality prediction performance, and external validation across diverse institutions demonstrates model generalizability.

Abstract: Early prediction of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients can aid clinicians in optimizing treatment. The objective was to develop a multimodal deep learning model, using structured and unstructured clinical data, to predict in-hospital mortality risk among critically ill patients after their initial 24 hour intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used data from MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID. A multimodal model was developed on the MIMIC datasets, featuring time series components occurring within the first 24 hours of ICU admission and predicting risk of subsequent inpatient mortality. Inputs included time-invariant variables, time-variant variables, clinical notes, and chest X-ray images. External validation occurred in a temporally separated MIMIC population, HiRID, and eICU datasets. A total of 203,434 ICU admissions from more than 200 hospitals between 2001 to 2022 were included, in which mortality rate ranged from 5.2% to 7.9% across the four datasets. The model integrating structured data points had AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier scores of 0.92, 0.53, and 0.19, respectively. We externally validated the model on eight different institutions within the eICU dataset, demonstrating AUROCs ranging from 0.84-0.92. When including only patients with available clinical notes and imaging data, inclusion of notes and imaging into the model, the AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier score improved from 0.87 to 0.89, 0.43 to 0.48, and 0.37 to 0.17, respectively. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating multiple sources of patient information for mortality prediction and the importance of external validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finding rare but useful solutions in very large candidate spaces is a recurring practical challenge across language generation, planning, and reinforcement learning. There's a need for practical methods that can efficiently locate these rare solutions without requiring extensive sampling.

Method: Inverted Causality Focusing Algorithm (ICFA) treats search as a target-conditioned reweighting process. It reuses an available proposal sampler and a task-specific similarity function to form a focused sampling distribution, while adaptively controlling focusing strength to avoid degeneracy. The method includes stability diagnostics based on effective sample size and can be combined with structured prompts for language-level approximation.

Result: The paper provides a clear recipe, stability diagnostics, theoretical analysis explaining when ICFA can reduce sample needs, and demonstrates reproducible experiments in constrained language generation and sparse-reward navigation. It also shows how structured prompts instantiate an approximate form of ICFA and describes a hybrid architecture combining prompted inference with algorithmic reweighting.

Conclusion: ICFA offers a practical framework for efficient search in large candidate spaces by leveraging existing proposal samplers with adaptive focusing, providing both theoretical grounding and practical implementations across multiple domains including language generation and reinforcement learning.

Motivation: Current evaluation of synthetic data is fragmented across heterogeneous metrics, ad-hoc scripts, and incomplete reporting practices, creating a need for standardized, comprehensive assessment tools.

Method: Developed a modular Python library (SDB) with automated feature-type detection, distributional/dependency fidelity metrics, graph/embedding-based structure preservation scores, and visualization schemas.

Result: Successfully evaluated SDB across three diverse real-world use cases (healthcare, socioeconomic/financial, cybersecurity) showing it can handle mixed-type clinical variables, high-cardinality categorical attributes, and high-dimensional telemetry signals.

Conclusion: SDB provides a consistent, transparent, and reproducible benchmarking framework for synthetic data fidelity assessment across heterogeneous domains, addressing current fragmentation in evaluation practices.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), synthetic data are widely used to accelerate innovation while preserving privacy and enabling broader data accessibility. However, the evaluation of synthetic data remains fragmented across heterogeneous metrics, ad-hoc scripts, and incomplete reporting practices. To address this gap, we introduce Synthetic Data Blueprint (SDB), a modular Pythonic based library to quantitatively and visually assess the fidelity of synthetic tabular data. SDB supports: (i) automated feature-type detection, (ii) distributional and dependency-level fidelity metrics, (iii) graph- and embedding-based structure preservation scores, and (iv) a rich suite of data visualization schemas. To demonstrate the breadth, robustness, and domain-agnostic applicability of the SDB, we evaluated the framework across three real-world use cases that differ substantially in scale, feature composition, statistical complexity, and downstream analytical requirements. These include: (i) healthcare diagnostics, (ii) socioeconomic and financial modelling, and (iii) cybersecurity and network traffic analysis. These use cases reveal how SDB can address diverse data fidelity assessment challenges, varying from mixed-type clinical variables to high-cardinality categorical attributes and high-dimensional telemetry signals, while at the same time offering a consistent, transparent, and reproducible benchmarking across heterogeneous domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current modeling techniques for assessing battery degradation sequences are inefficient and inadequate for real-life applications, particularly in capturing both local and global correlations of degradation patterns for reliable RUL prediction.

Method: Proposes MDFA-Net (multiscale dual-path feature aggregation network) with two parallel networks: MF-Net (multiscale feature network) that preserves shallow information, and EC-Net (encoder network) that captures continuous trends and deep details. This dual-path approach integrates both deep and shallow attributes to grasp local and global patterns.

Result: Testing on two publicly available Lithium-ion battery datasets shows the approach surpasses existing top-tier methods in RUL forecasting and accurately maps capacity degradation trajectories.

Conclusion: MDFA-Net provides an effective solution for battery RUL prediction by addressing the limitations of current modeling techniques through its dual-path architecture that captures both local and global degradation patterns, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Targeted maintenance strategies, ensuring the dependability and safety of industrial machinery. However, current modeling techniques for assessing both local and global correlation of battery degradation sequences are inefficient and difficult to meet the needs in real-life applications. For this reason, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, multiscale dual-path feature aggregation network (MDFA-Net), for RUL prediction. MDFA-Net consists of dual-path networks, the first path network, multiscale feature network (MF-Net) that maintains the shallow information and avoids missing information, and the second path network is an encoder network (EC-Net) that captures the continuous trend of the sequences and retains deep details. Integrating both deep and shallow attributes effectively grasps both local and global patterns. Testing conducted with two publicly available Lithium-ion battery datasets reveals our approach surpasses existing top-tier methods in RUL forecasting, accurately mapping the capacity degradation trajectory.

### [131] [Per-Axis Weight Deltas for Frequent Model Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19720)
*Stefan Kuyumdzhiev,Radostin Cholakov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 1-bit delta compression method for fine-tuned LLM weights that stores only sign bits with per-axis scaling factors, reducing storage and cold-start latency while maintaining inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Serving many task-specialized LLM variants is limited by large fine-tuned checkpoint sizes and resulting cold-start latency, despite fine-tuned weights differing from base models by small structured residuals.

Method: Proposes a 1-bit delta scheme storing only the sign of weight differences with lightweight per-axis (row/column) FP16 scaling factors, learned from small calibration set. Uses streamlined loader for single-operation per module transfer.

Result: Artifacts several times smaller than full FP16 checkpoints, reduces cold-start latency and storage overhead, improves reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives while maintaining inference efficiency.

Conclusion: The method is drop-in, requires minimal calibration data, avoids dense reconstruction, and provides efficient compression for frequent model updates with available experimental setup and source code.

Abstract: Serving many task-specialized LLM variants is often limited by the large size of fine-tuned checkpoints and the resulting cold-start latency. Since fine-tuned weights differ from their base model by relatively small structured residuals, a natural approach is to represent them as compressed deltas. We propose a simple 1-bit delta scheme that stores only the sign of the weight difference together with lightweight per-axis (row/column) FP16 scaling factors, learned from a small calibration set. This design preserves the compactness of 1-bit deltas while more accurately capturing variation across weight dimensions, leading to improved reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives. From a systems perspective, a streamlined loader that transfers packed deltas in a single operation per module reduces cold-start latency and storage overhead, with artifacts several times smaller than a full FP16 checkpoint. The method is drop-in, requires minimal calibration data, and maintains inference efficiency by avoiding dense reconstruction.

*Vineet Yadav*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A sign-aware multistate Jaccard/Tanimoto framework extends overlap-based distances to real/complex-valued signals while preserving metric and kernel properties, with applications in scientific and financial analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Jaccard/Tanimoto distances are limited to nonnegative vectors and measures, lacking support for real- and complex-valued signals with sign information, which is crucial for many scientific and financial applications.

Method: Signals are represented as atomic measures on signed state space, embedded into nonnegative multistate representations via positive/negative splits (real) or Cartesian/polar decompositions (complex). The Tanimoto construction yields bounded distances with triangle inequality and positive-semidefinite kernels.

Result: The framework provides a single interpretable distance with bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and analytical tools.

Conclusion: The sign-aware multistate Jaccard/Tanimoto framework successfully extends overlap-based distances to arbitrary real- and complex-valued signals while maintaining desirable mathematical properties and interpretability for practical applications.

Abstract: We introduce a sign-aware, multistate Jaccard/Tanimoto framework that extends overlap-based distances from nonnegative vectors and measures to arbitrary real- and complex-valued signals while retaining bounded metric and positive-semidefinite kernel structure. Formally, the construction is a set- and measure-theoretic geometry: signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, and similarity is given by a generalized Jaccard overlap of these measures. Each signal is embedded into a nonnegative multistate representation, using positive/negative splits for real signals, Cartesian and polar decompositions for complex signals, and user-defined state partitions for refined regime analysis. Applying the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings yields a family of $[0,1]$ distances that satisfy the triangle inequality and define positive-semidefinite kernels usable directly in kernel methods and graph-based learning. Beyond pairwise distances, we develop coalition analysis via Möbius inversion, which decomposes signal magnitude into nonnegative, additive contributions with exact budget closure across coalitions of signals. Normalizing the same embeddings produces probability measures on coordinate -- state configurations, so that the distance becomes a monotone transform of total variation and admits a regime -- intensity decomposition. The resulting construction yields a single, mechanistically interpretable distance that simultaneously provides bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting within one sign-aware framework, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other analytical tools in scientific and financial applications.

TL;DR: BrainROI model improves multimodal brain decoding by addressing cross-subject generalization and interpretability challenges through fMRI encoding with soft-ROI shared space, voxel-wise gated fusion, interpretable prompt optimization, and parameterized decoding constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal brain decoding faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization (due to heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects) and interpretability (limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency).

Method: 1) New fMRI encoder using multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as shared space with voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate) and global label alignment for cross-subject consistency. 2) Interpretable prompt optimization using locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts in small-sample closed loop. 3) Parameterized decoding constraints during inference for improved stability and quality.

Result: Achieves leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on NSD dataset. Under cross-subject setting, shows clear improvements in metrics like BLEU-4 and CIDEr compared to recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines.

Conclusion: BrainROI model successfully addresses cross-subject generalization and interpretability challenges in multimodal brain decoding through innovative fMRI encoding, interpretable prompt optimization, and constrained decoding, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Multimodal brain decoding aims to reconstruct semantic information that is consistent with visual stimuli from brain activity signals such as fMRI, and then generate readable natural language descriptions. However, multimodal brain decoding still faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization and interpretability. We propose a BrainROI model and achieve leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on the NSD dataset. Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process. In a small-sample closed loop, we use a locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts. This process improves the stability of prompt design and preserves an auditable optimization trajectory. Finally, we impose parameterized decoding constraints during inference to further improve the stability and quality of the generated descriptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the exploration-exploitation trade-off in sequential learning using Information Directed Sampling policies, focusing on tractable two-state Bernoulli bandits as a minimal model to rigorously compare heuristic strategies against optimal policies.

Method: Extends IDS framework to discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing modified information measure and tuning parameter; examines two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and one-fair-coin scenario.

Result: In symmetric case, IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret; in one-fair-coin scenario, IDS yields regret that scales logarithmically with horizon, matching classical asymptotic lower bounds.

Conclusion: The work serves as pedagogical synthesis bridging reinforcement learning and information theory concepts for statistical physicists, demonstrating IDS effectiveness in fundamental bandit settings.

Abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit problem provides a fundamental framework for analyzing the tension between exploration and exploitation in sequential learning. This paper explores Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies, a class of heuristics that balance immediate regret against information gain. We focus on the tractable environment of two-state Bernoulli bandits as a minimal model to rigorously compare heuristic strategies against the optimal policy. We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds. This work serves as a pedagogical synthesis, aiming to bridge concepts from reinforcement learning and information theory for an audience of statistical physicists.

TL;DR: Methodology adjusts forecasts using node-specific cost asymmetry to generate savings by favoring least expensive scenarios, with self-regulation and empirical validation showing $5.1M annual savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forecasting models don't account for the asymmetric costs associated with different forecast errors - some errors are more expensive than others depending on the specific node/context. This creates an opportunity to optimize forecasts by incorporating cost asymmetry information.

Method: Proposes a methodology that dynamically incorporates node-specific cost function asymmetry into the forecasting error probability distribution to favor least expensive scenarios. Includes a self-regulation mechanism that modulates adjustment magnitude based on observed savings, enabling adaptation to station-specific conditions and unmodeled factors like calibration errors or shifting macroeconomic dynamics.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate the model's ability to achieve $5.1M in annual savings, showing practical financial benefits from incorporating cost asymmetry into forecasting adjustments.

*Srishti Gupta,Riccardo Balia,Daniele Angioni,Fabio Brau,Maura Pintor,Ambra Demontis,Alessandro Sebastian,Salvatore Mario Carta,Fabio Roli,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need for Continual Learning and Out-of-Distribution detection to address the limitations of traditional ML models in dynamic real-world environments where data distributions change over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML models assume i.i.d. data distributions, but real-world applications face evolving data streams and novel conditions. Retraining from scratch is impractical, creating a need for adaptive systems that can learn continuously while detecting unfamiliar inputs.

Method: The paper proposes addressing both Continual Learning (enabling incremental learning without forgetting) and Out-of-Distribution detection (identifying novel/anomalous inputs) as joint solutions for robust AI systems.

Result: The abstract establishes the critical importance of developing models that can adapt to changing data distributions while maintaining reliability, though specific experimental results are not provided in this abstract.

Conclusion: Jointly addressing Continual Learning and OOD detection is essential for creating robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems that can operate effectively in dynamic real-world environments.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the development of machine learning models across a wide range of fields, fueled by increased computational resources, large-scale datasets, and the rise of deep learning architectures. From malware detection to enabling autonomous navigation, modern machine learning systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, as these models are deployed in ever-changing real-world scenarios, their ability to remain reliable and adaptive over time becomes increasingly important. For example, in the real world, new malware families are continuously developed, whereas autonomous driving cars are employed in many different cities and weather conditions. Models trained in fixed settings can not respond effectively to novel conditions encountered post-deployment. In fact, most machine learning models are still developed under the assumption that training and test data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), i.e., sampled from the same underlying (unknown) distribution. While this assumption simplifies model development and evaluation, it does not hold in many real-world applications, where data changes over time and unexpected inputs frequently occur. Retraining models from scratch whenever new data appears is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and impractical in resource-constrained environments. These limitations underscore the need for Continual Learning (CL), which enables models to incrementally learn from evolving data streams without forgetting past knowledge, and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, which allows systems to identify and respond to novel or anomalous inputs. Jointly addressing both challenges is critical to developing robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems.

*Carlos Purves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Split-policy RL architecture with on-device encoder reduces communication overhead and latency for visual policies on edge devices while maintaining comparable learning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying visual RL policies on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging due to computational costs and communication latency. Current approaches that offload policy inference to remote servers require transmitting high-dimensional observations, causing network round trips and latency issues.

Method: Proposes a split-policy architecture where a small on-device encoder (implemented as OpenGL fragment-shader passes for broad embedded GPU support) transforms observations into compact feature tensors. These compressed features are transmitted to a remote policy head for decision-making, reducing data transmission and latency.

Result: Reduces transmitted data, lowers decision latency in bandwidth-limited settings, and reduces server-side compute per request. Achieves broadly comparable learning performance by final return (mean over final 100 episodes) in single-run benchmarks with modest trade-offs in mean return. Evaluated across NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi 4B, and Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.

Conclusion: The split-policy approach effectively addresses deployment challenges of visual RL policies on edge devices by reducing communication overhead and latency while maintaining learning performance, with code released as open source.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved strong results, but deploying visual policies on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to computational cost and communication latency. Many deployments therefore offload policy inference to a remote server, incurring network round trips and requiring transmission of high-dimensional observations. We introduce a split-policy architecture in which a small on-device encoder, implemented as OpenGL fragment-shader passes for broad embedded GPU support, transforms each observation into a compact feature tensor that is transmitted to a remote policy head. In RL, this communication overhead manifests as closed-loop decision latency rather than only per-request inference latency. The proposed approach reduces transmitted data, lowers decision latency in bandwidth-limited settings, and reduces server-side compute per request, whilst achieving broadly comparable learning performance by final return (mean over the final 100 episodes) in single-run benchmarks, with modest trade-offs in mean return. We evaluate across an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, a Raspberry Pi 4B, and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, reporting learning results, on-device execution behaviour under sustained load, and end-to-end decision latency and scalability measurements under bandwidth shaping. Code for training, deployment, and measurement is released as open source.

*Peng-Hung Tsai,Daniel Berleant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a hybrid forecasting model combining LSTM neural networks with augmented Moore's law to predict spacecraft lifetimes, addressing right-censoring bias using the STETI method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Technology forecasting in complex domains like space exploration is challenging due to technical, economic, and policy interactions. Current methods need improvement to handle right-censoring bias in spacecraft lifetime data where recent launches have incomplete failure data.

Method: Combines LSTM neural networks with augmented Moore's law for spacecraft lifetime prediction. Introduces novel improvements to the STETI (Start Time End Time Integration) approach to address right-censoring bias by interconverting between launch time and failure time modeling.

Result: The hybrid model provides improved spacecraft lifetime forecasts by mitigating the systematic downward bias in lifetime estimates for recent launch dates. The STETI enhancement successfully addresses the right-censoring problem in lifetime analysis.

Conclusion: The developed forecasting model offers valuable insights for space mission planning and policy decision-making by providing more accurate spacecraft lifetime predictions that account for data censoring issues.

Abstract: Forecasting technological advancement in complex domains such as space exploration presents significant challenges due to the intricate interaction of technical, economic, and policy-related factors. The field of technology forecasting has long relied on quantitative trend extrapolation techniques, such as growth curves (e.g., Moore's law) and time series models, to project technological progress. To assess the current state of these methods, we conducted an updated systematic literature review (SLR) that incorporates recent advances. This review highlights a growing trend toward machine learning-based hybrid models.
  Motivated by this review, we developed a forecasting model that combines long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with an augmentation of Moore's law to predict spacecraft lifetimes. Operational lifetime is an important engineering characteristic of spacecraft and a potential proxy for technological progress in space exploration. Lifetimes were modeled as depending on launch date and additional predictors.
  Our modeling analysis introduces a novel advance in the recently introduced Start Time End Time Integration (STETI) approach. STETI addresses a critical right censoring problem known to bias lifetime analyses: the more recent the launch dates, the shorter the lifetimes of the spacecraft that have failed and can thus contribute lifetime data. Longer-lived spacecraft are still operating and therefore do not contribute data. This systematically distorts putative lifetime versus launch date curves by biasing lifetime estimates for recent launch dates downward. STETI mitigates this distortion by interconverting between expressing lifetimes as functions of launch time and modeling them as functions of failure time. The results provide insights relevant to space mission planning and policy decision-making.

*Haocheng Lu,Minjun Zhu,Henry Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight post-training pipeline using a compact MathVerifier to detect structured errors in LLM math reasoning, enabling verifier-guided weighted DPO for targeted improvements without expensive reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with mathematical reasoning, and current post-training approaches treat solutions as binary (correct/incorrect), missing structured errors. RLHF variants are expensive, difficult to scale, and unstable.

Method: Start with SFT on MetaMathQA-style CoT data, then introduce a compact MathVerifier that decomposes solutions into six-dimensional error profiles to produce wrongness/absurdity scores. Use these signals to mine hard negatives and define per-sample importance weights for verifier-guided weighted DPO.

Result: Experiments on 1.5B-parameter Qwen2.5 show verifier-guided weighted DPO yields more targeted improvements than vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, especially on problems with numerically close but logically inconsistent solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight pipeline effectively targets structured errors in mathematical reasoning without the overhead of training large reward models or relying on external judges, offering a practical solution under realistic compute budgets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with mathematical reasoning, and common post-training pipelines often reduce each generated solution to a binary outcome: correct or incorrect. This perspective is limiting in practice, as failures in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning are frequently structured; solutions may appear convincing while containing subtle logical, algebraic, or numerical flaws. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) variants that rely on large reward models or LLM-as-a-judge signals are often expensive, difficult to scale, and unstable to iterate. We propose a lightweight and pragmatic post-training pipeline that targets such structured errors under realistic compute budgets. Starting from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on MetaMathQA-style CoT data, we introduce a compact MathVerifier that decomposes a candidate solution into a six-dimensional error profile and aggregates it into interpretable wrongness and absurdity scores. These verifier signals serve two roles: (i) mining hard negatives that are near-correct yet structurally flawed, and (ii) defining per-sample importance weights that emphasize the most informative preference pairs. We integrate both into an offline Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective via a verifier-guided weighted formulation. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter Qwen2.5 model show that verifier-guided, weighted DPO yields more targeted improvements than vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, particularly on problems where solutions are numerically close to correct but logically inconsistent, while avoiding the overhead of training large reward models or relying on external judges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show potential for SSL but face trade-offs between generative quality and discriminative performance, plus high computational costs from iterative sampling that hinder industrial and edge AI applications.

Method: Proposes FlowFM with decoupled design: jointly trains representation encoder and conditional flow matching generator. Uses flow matching to learn simpler velocity field, accelerating and stabilizing training for efficient representation learning.

Result: On wearable sensor data: 50.4% training time reduction vs diffusion approach. Surpassed state-of-the-art SSL-Wearables on all 5 datasets with up to 51.0x inference speedup while maintaining high generative quality.

Conclusion: FlowFM effectively addresses diffusion model limitations by combining flow matching for efficiency with joint training for both generation and recognition, making it suitable for industrial and edge AI applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models can learn rich representations during data generation, showing potential for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), but they face a trade-off between generative quality and discriminative performance. Their iterative sampling also incurs substantial computational and energy costs, hindering industrial and edge AI applications. To address these issues, we propose the Flow Matching-based Foundation Model (FlowFM), which jointly trains a representation encoder and a conditional flow matching generator. This decoupled design achieves both high-fidelity generation and effective recognition. By using flow matching to learn a simpler velocity field, FlowFM accelerates and stabilizes training, improving its efficiency for representation learning. Experiments on wearable sensor data show FlowFM reduces training time by 50.4\% compared to a diffusion-based approach. On downstream tasks, FlowFM surpassed the state-of-the-art SSL method (SSL-Wearables) on all five datasets while achieving up to a 51.0x inference speedup and maintaining high generative quality.

TL;DR: ArcGen: A novel black-box neural backdoor detection method that learns architecture-invariant features to improve generalization to unseen model architectures, achieving up to 42.5% AUC improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods fail to generalize well to new model architectures not seen during training, limiting their practical applicability in real-world scenarios where model architectures vary.

Method: Proposes ArcGen with an alignment layer in feature extraction to reduce architecture influence, plus two alignment losses (distribution and sample level) that enforce feature alignment across models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures.

Result: Achieves up to 42.5% improvement in detection performance (AUC) on unseen model architectures, validated on 16,896 models across diverse datasets, backdoor attacks, and architectures.

Conclusion: ArcGen effectively addresses the generalization problem in neural backdoor detection by learning architecture-invariant features, making it more practical for real-world deployment where model architectures are diverse and unknown.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of deep learning models. To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ArcGen. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/SeRAlab/ArcGen.

TL;DR: Double-Win NAS is a neural architecture search paradigm that first searches for accurate deep networks, then transforms them into efficient shallow networks for embedded systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep CNNs achieve high accuracy but have poor hardware efficiency on embedded systems, while shallow networks are efficient but less accurate. There's a need for a solution that can achieve both high accuracy and hardware efficiency for resource-constrained embedded intelligence.

Method: A deep-to-shallow transformable NAS paradigm that: 1) Searches for deep networks with strong accuracy, 2) Equivalently transforms them into shallow counterparts for hardware efficiency, 3) Uses hybrid transformable training for better accuracy, and 4) Arbitrary-resolution elastic training for network elasticity across input resolutions.

Result: Superior performance demonstrated on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and Jetson Nano embedded systems using ImageNet and ImageNet-100 datasets, outperforming previous state-of-the-art NAS approaches.

Conclusion: Double-Win NAS effectively addresses the accuracy-efficiency trade-off in embedded systems by combining deep network accuracy with shallow network efficiency through transformable architecture search and enhanced training techniques.

Abstract: Thanks to the evolving network depth, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various embedded scenarios, paving the way for ubiquitous embedded intelligence. Despite its promise, the evolving network depth comes at the cost of degraded hardware efficiency. In contrast to deep networks, shallow networks can deliver superior hardware efficiency but often suffer from inferior accuracy. To address this dilemma, we propose Double-Win NAS, a novel deep-to-shallow transformable neural architecture search (NAS) paradigm tailored for resource-constrained intelligent embedded systems. Specifically, Double-Win NAS strives to automatically explore deep networks to first win strong accuracy, which are then equivalently transformed into their shallow counterparts to further win strong hardware efficiency. In addition to search, we also propose two enhanced training techniques, including hybrid transformable training towards better training accuracy and arbitrary-resolution elastic training towards enabling natural network elasticity across arbitrary input resolutions. Extensive experimental results on two popular intelligent embedded systems (i.e., NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and NVIDIA Jetson Nano) and two representative large-scale datasets (i.e., ImageNet and ImageNet-100) clearly demonstrate the superiority of Double-Win NAS over previous state-of-the-art NAS approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address potential data leakage in bandgap prediction by identifying and removing descriptors that inadvertently encode band-structure information, creating a reliable dataset for future studies.

Method: Three-phase modeling framework: 1) basic physical descriptors, 2) engineered features, 3) compositional attributes. Uses tree-based models and SHAP analysis on curated leakage-controlled dataset.

Result: Tree-based models achieve R2 values of 0.88-0.90 across all phases; expanding descriptor space doesn't substantially improve accuracy when leakage is controlled; dielectric tensor components identified as dominant contributors via SHAP analysis.

Conclusion: Provides curated dataset and baseline performance metrics for leakage-aware bandgap prediction, demonstrating that controlled leakage is more important than descriptor complexity for accurate predictions.

Abstract: In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the JARVIS-DFT bandgap dataset and identify and remove descriptors that may inadvertently encode band-structure information, such as effective masses. This process yields a curated, leakage-controlled subset of 2280 materials. Using this dataset, a three-phase modeling framework is implemented that incrementally incorporates basic physical descriptors, engineered features, and compositional attributes. The results show that tree-based models achieve R2 values of approximately 0.88 to 0.90 across all phases, indicating that expanding the descriptor space does not substantially improve predictive accuracy when leakage is controlled. SHAP analysis consistently identifies the dielectric tensor components as the dominant contributors. This work provides a curated dataset and baseline performance metrics for future leakage-aware bandgap prediction studies.

TL;DR: A novel unsupervised method for extracting interpretable concepts from neural networks by clustering activation differences, outperforming sparse autoencoders and approaching supervised baselines across vision, language, and audio models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a simpler and more effective alternative to sparse autoencoders for unsupervised concept extraction from neural networks, addressing limitations in existing unsupervised methods while maintaining interpretability.

Method: Clusters differences in neural activations within a discriminant analysis framework, enhanced by weighting clustering using activation skewness to improve concept diversity. The approach is philosophically aligned with Deleuze's view of concepts as differences.

Result: The method achieves superior concept quality compared to prior unsupervised SAE variants, approaches supervised baselines, and demonstrates causal influence through successful model steering across five models and three modalities (vision, language, audio).

Conclusion: The proposed clustering-based approach provides an effective unsupervised alternative to SAEs for concept extraction, with demonstrated practical utility in model steering and interpretability across diverse neural network architectures and modalities.

Abstract: We propose an alternative to sparse autoencoders (SAEs) as a simple and effective unsupervised method for extracting interpretable concepts from neural networks. The core idea is to cluster differences in activations, which we formally justify within a discriminant analysis framework. To enhance the diversity of extracted concepts, we refine the approach by weighting the clustering using the skewness of activations. The method aligns with Deleuze's modern view of concepts as differences. We evaluate the approach across five models and three modalities (vision, language, and audio), measuring concept quality, diversity, and consistency. Our results show that the proposed method achieves concept quality surpassing prior unsupervised SAE variants while approaching supervised baselines, and that the extracted concepts enable steering of a model's inner representations, demonstrating their causal influence on downstream behavior.

*Gangxiong Zhang,Yongchao Long*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free prompting framework (CAP) improves both fairness and accuracy in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction by using case-based reasoning to correct biased patterns, achieving over 90% reduction in demographic disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise for ICU mortality prediction but exhibit demographic biases (sex, age, race) that limit trustworthy clinical use. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, creating a trade-off between fairness and accuracy.

Method: Proposed CAse Prompting (CAP) framework: 1) Multi-dimensional bias assessment for comprehensive diagnosis, 2) Integration of conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning, 3) Guides model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and correct outcomes to address biased reasoning patterns.

Result: On MIMIC-IV dataset: AUROC increased from 0.806 to 0.873, AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694. Reduced sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis showed highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups (similarity scores > 0.98).

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction. CAP effectively co-optimizes fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support through training-free prompting.

Abstract: Accurate mortality risk prediction for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is essential for clinical decision-making. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and that a carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support.

### [147] [CoPHo: Classifier-guided Conditional Topology Generation with Persistent Homology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19736)
*Gongli Xi,Ye Tian,Mengyu Yang,Zhenyu Zhao,Yuchao Zhang,Xiangyang Gong,Xirong Que,Wendong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoPHo is a classifier-guided conditional topology generation method that uses persistent homology to steer graph generation toward desired structural properties without retraining for each attribute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topology data is scarce, requiring synthetic graph generation for testing. Existing diffusion-based methods either need retraining for each attribute (limiting real-time use) or use classifier guidance that ignores topology scale and practical constraints.

Method: CoPHo incorporates gradients from a pre-trained graph-level classifier into discrete reverse diffusion posterior. It builds persistent homology filtrations over intermediate graphs and uses features as guidance signals to steer generation toward desired properties at each denoising step.

Result: CoPHo outperforms existing methods at matching target metrics on four generic/network datasets, and demonstrates transferability on the QM9 molecular dataset.

Conclusion: The method enables conditional topology generation without retraining for each attribute, using persistent homology-based guidance to effectively steer diffusion toward desired structural properties.

Abstract: The structure of topology underpins much of the research on performance and robustness, yet available topology data are typically scarce, necessitating the generation of synthetic graphs with desired properties for testing or release. Prior diffusion-based approaches either embed conditions into the diffusion model, requiring retraining for each attribute and hindering real-time applicability, or use classifier-based guidance post-training, which does not account for topology scale and practical constraints. In this paper, we show from a discrete perspective that gradients from a pre-trained graph-level classifier can be incorporated into the discrete reverse diffusion posterior to steer generation toward specified structural properties. Based on this insight, we propose Classifier-guided Conditional Topology Generation with Persistent Homology (CoPHo), which builds a persistent homology filtration over intermediate graphs and interprets features as guidance signals that steer generation toward the desired properties at each denoising step. Experiments on four generic/network datasets demonstrate that CoPHo outperforms existing methods at matching target metrics, and we further validate its transferability on the QM9 molecular dataset.

*Clément Elliker,Jesse Read,Sonia Vanier,Albert Bifet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DCIL (Drift-Corrected Imitation Learning) improves train delay forecasting by combining event-driven models with data-driven methods using self-supervised learning with drift correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable train delay prediction is crucial for railway system robustness and efficiency, but current methods struggle with uncertainty and sequential delay propagation in large networks.

Method: DCIL reframes delay forecasting as stochastic simulation using imitation learning with drift correction. It extends DAgger algorithm with distance-based drift correction to mitigate covariate shift during rollouts without needing external oracle or adversarial schemes.

Result: DCIL outperforms traditional regression models and behavioral cloning on deep learning architectures in real-world Belgian railway data (3M+ train movements), showing superior predictive performance for up to 30-minute ahead forecasts.

Conclusion: DCIL effectively captures sequential and uncertain nature of delay propagation in large-scale railway networks by synthesizing dynamical fidelity of event-driven models with representational capacity of data-driven methods.

Abstract: Reliable prediction of train delays is essential for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of railway transportation systems. In this work, we reframe delay forecasting as a stochastic simulation task, modeling state-transition dynamics through imitation learning. We introduce Drift-Corrected Imitation Learning (DCIL), a novel self-supervised algorithm that extends DAgger by incorporating distance-based drift correction, thereby mitigating covariate shift during rollouts without requiring access to an external oracle or adversarial schemes. Our approach synthesizes the dynamical fidelity of event-driven models with the representational capacity of data-driven methods, enabling uncertainty-aware forecasting via Monte Carlo simulation. We evaluate DCIL using a comprehensive real-world dataset from \textsc{Infrabel}, the Belgian railway infrastructure manager, which encompasses over three million train movements. Our results, focused on predictions up to 30 minutes ahead, demonstrate superior predictive performance of DCIL over traditional regression models and behavioral cloning on deep learning architectures, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing the sequential and uncertain nature of delay propagation in large-scale networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpComm is a forecasting framework combining LightGBM regression, PPO reinforcement learning for buffer control, and generative AI for interpretability, reducing forecasting errors by 21.65% across 400+ delivery stations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate package volume forecasting is critical for last-mile logistics to avoid inefficient resource allocation, higher costs, and delivery delays caused by forecasting errors.

Method: Combines supervised learning (LightGBM regression for demand forecasts) with reinforcement learning (PPO agent for buffer control) and generative AI for communication. Uses Monte Carlo updates for continual policy adaptation and SHAP-based feature attributions for interpretability.

Result: Reduced Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE) by 21.65% compared to manual forecasts across 400+ stations, while lowering under-buffering incidents and improving transparency for decision-makers.

Conclusion: Demonstrates how contextual reinforcement learning combined with predictive modeling can address operational forecasting challenges and bridge statistical rigor with practical decision-making in high-stakes logistics environments.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of package volumes at delivery stations is critical for last-mile logistics, where errors lead to inefficient resource allocation, higher costs, and delivery delays. We propose OpComm, a forecasting and decision-support framework that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning-based buffer control and a generative AI-driven communication module. A LightGBM regression model generates station-level demand forecasts, which serve as context for a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that selects buffer levels from a discrete action set. The reward function penalizes under-buffering more heavily than over-buffering, reflecting real-world trade-offs between unmet demand risks and resource inefficiency. Station outcomes are fed back through a Monte Carlo update mechanism, enabling continual policy adaptation. To enhance interpretability, a generative AI layer produces executive-level summaries and scenario analyses grounded in SHAP-based feature attributions. Across 400+ stations, OpComm reduced Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE) by 21.65% compared to manual forecasts, while lowering under-buffering incidents and improving transparency for decision-makers. This work shows how contextual reinforcement learning, coupled with predictive modeling, can address operational forecasting challenges and bridge statistical rigor with practical decision-making in high-stakes logistics environments.

### [150] [OASI: Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization for Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization in TinyML Keyword Spotting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19739)
*Soumen Garai,Suman Samui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OASI: A novel initialization method for multi-objective Bayesian optimization in TinyML keyword spotting that uses simulated annealing to generate better seed configurations, outperforming traditional sampling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current initialization methods for multi-objective Bayesian optimization in resource-constrained TinyML keyword spotting are naive and not adapted to the Pareto front, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposed Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI) uses Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing to generate a seed Pareto set that explicitly balances accuracy and model size for TinyML keyword spotting models.

Result: OASI outperformed LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, achieving highest hypervolume (0.0627) and lowest generational distance (0.0) with modest computational overhead (1934s vs ~1500s). Statistical analysis showed superior consistency.

Conclusion: OASI provides a statistically superior initialization strategy for multi-objective Bayesian optimization in TinyML keyword spotting, enabling better trade-offs between accuracy and model size under strict resource constraints.

Abstract: Voice assistants utilize Keyword Spotting (KWS) to enable efficient, privacy-friendly activation. However, realizing accurate KWS models on ultra-low-power TinyML devices (often with less than $<2$ MB of flash memory) necessitates a delicate balance between accuracy with strict resource constraints. Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) is an ideal candidate for managing such a trade-off but is highly initialization-dependent, especially under the budgeted black-box setting. Existing methods typically fall back to naive, ad-hoc sampling routines (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Sobol sequences, or Random search) that are adapted to neither the Pareto front nor undergo rigorous statistical comparison. To address this, we propose Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI), a novel initialization strategy that leverages Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to generate a seed Pareto set of high-performing and diverse configurations that explicitly balance accuracy and model size. Evaluated in a TinyML KWS setting, OASI outperforms LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, achieving the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and the lowest generational distance (0.0) across multiple runs, with only a modest increase in computation time (1934 s vs. $\sim$1500 s). A non-parametric statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test ($H = 5.40$, $p = 0.144$, $η^2 = 0.0007$) and Dunn's post-hoc test confirms OASI's superior consistency despite the non-significant overall difference with respect to the $α=0.05$ threshold.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large transformer models on edge devices is challenging due to strict memory, compute, and latency constraints, requiring efficient compression techniques without costly retraining.

Method: Combines activation profiling, memory-aware pruning, selective FP16 execution, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to compress ViT-Huge models without retraining or task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: On CIFAR-10, the optimized model achieves 76% reduction in peak memory usage, over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical path for efficient transformer inference on edge platforms and opens avenues for integrating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts architectures.

Abstract: Deploying large-scale transformer models on edge devices presents significant challenges due to strict constraints on memory, compute, and latency. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective multi-stage optimization pipeline designed to compress and accelerate Vision Transformers (ViTs) for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our methodology combines activation profiling, memory-aware pruning, selective mixed-precision execution, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to reduce the model's memory footprint without requiring costly retraining or task-specific fine-tuning. Starting from a ViT-Huge backbone with 632 million parameters, we first identify low-importance channels using activation statistics collected via forward hooks, followed by structured pruning to shrink the MLP layers under a target memory budget. We further apply FP16 conversion to selected components and leverage AWQ to quantize the remaining model weights and activations to INT8 with minimal accuracy degradation. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the fully optimized model achieves a 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline. This framework offers a practical path toward efficient transformer inference on edge platforms, and opens future avenues for integrating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures to further scale performance across diverse tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing loss functions for 3D point clouds have trade-offs: Chamfer Distance is efficient but allows many-to-one correspondences, Earth Mover Distance has better one-to-one transport but is computationally expensive, and APML approximates transport but has quadratic memory scaling.

Method: Sparse GPU implementation that thresholds negligible assignments, runs adaptive softmax, bidirectional symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization directly in COO format, preserving gradients on stored support.

Result: Matches dense APML within small tolerance on ShapeNet and MM-Fi datasets while reducing peak GPU memory by 99.9% with near-linear memory scaling.

Conclusion: CUDA-APML provides an efficient, memory-friendly alternative for 3D point cloud learning that maintains geometric fidelity while dramatically reducing computational resource requirements.

Abstract: Loss functions are fundamental to learning accurate 3D point cloud models, yet common choices trade geometric fidelity for computational cost. Chamfer Distance is efficient but permits many-to-one correspondences, while Earth Mover Distance better reflects one-to-one transport at high computational cost. APML approximates transport with differentiable Sinkhorn iterations and an analytically derived temperature, but its dense formulation scales quadratically in memory. We present CUDA-APML, a sparse GPU implementation that thresholds negligible assignments and runs adaptive softmax, bidirectional symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization directly in COO form. This yields near-linear memory scaling and preserves gradients on the stored support, while pairwise distance evaluation remains quadratic in the current implementation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MASS is a semantic-aware MoE framework that uses gradient-based semantic drift detection and adaptive routing to optimize expert specialization and expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SMoE frameworks either require heavy hyperparameter tuning or fail to properly diversify semantic roles across experts when adjusting expert pool size, limiting their ability to fully exploit MoE architectures' potential.

Method: MASS introduces: 1) gradient-based semantic drift detector to trigger expert expansion when existing experts lack capacity, and 2) adaptive routing strategy that dynamically adjusts expert usage based on token-level routing confidence.

Result: MASS reliably converges to optimal cost-performance balance with improved semantic specialization in synthetic tests, and consistently outperforms strong MoE baselines on real-world language and vision datasets.

Conclusion: MASS demonstrates domain robustness and enhanced expert specialization through its semantic-aware adaptive framework for expert expansion and dynamic routing.

Abstract: Finding the optimal configuration of Sparse Mixture-ofExperts (SMoE) that maximizes semantic differentiation among experts is essential for exploiting the full potential of MoE architectures. However, existing SMoE frameworks either heavily rely on hyperparameter tuning or overlook the importance of diversifying semantic roles across experts when adapting the expert pool size. We propose Mixture-of-Experts for Adaptive Semantic Specialization (MASS), a semanticaware MoE framework for adaptive expert expansion and dynamic routing. MASS introduces two key advancements: (i) a gradient-based semantic drift detector that prompts targeted expert expansion when the existing expert pool lacks capacity to capture the full semantic diversity of the data, and (ii) an integration of adaptive routing strategy that dynamically adjusts expert usage based on token-level routing confidence mass. We first demonstrate that MASS reliably converges to the point of optimal balance between cost-performance trade-off with notably improved sematic specialization in a highly controlled synthetic setup. Further empirical results on real-world datasets across language and vision domains show that MASS consistently outperforms a range of strong MoE baselines, demonstrating its domain robustness and enhanced expert specialization.

*Sandro Andric*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using human brain activity as a coordinate system to read and steer LLM states, creating neurophysiology-grounded interpretable controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM interpretability methods rely on textual supervision which lacks external grounding. Brain activity provides a biologically-grounded coordinate system for understanding and controlling LLM representations.

Method: Construct word-level brain atlas from MEG data using phase-locking value patterns, extract latent axes via ICA, validate with lexica/NER labels, train lightweight adapters to map LLM hidden states to brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM.

Result: Successfully extracted brain-derived axes including lexical (frequency-linked) axis in mid TinyLlama layer and function/content axis consistent across multiple models. Brain axes show larger log-frequency shifts with lower perplexity compared to text probes. Axis structure remains stable across different embedding methods.

Conclusion: Neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior, offering a new interface for brain-based LLM interpretability and steering.

Abstract: Interpretability methods for large language models (LLMs) typically derive directions from textual supervision, which can lack external grounding. We propose using human brain activity not as a training signal but as a coordinate system for reading and steering LLM states. Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix). Axis structure is stable when the atlas is rebuilt without GPT embedding-change features or with word2vec embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95 across matched axes), reducing circularity concerns. Exploratory fMRI anchoring suggests potential alignment for embedding change and log frequency, but effects are sensitive to hemodynamic modeling assumptions and are treated as population-level evidence only. These results support a new interface: neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior.

Motivation: Transit route network design is NP-hard with exponentially large solution spaces, traditionally relying on manual planning processes that may not be optimal.

Method: End-to-end reinforcement learning framework using graph attention networks for sequential transit network construction, with two-level reward structure combining incremental topological feedback and simulation-based terminal rewards.

Result: Under high transit adoption: 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9% shorter wait times, 21.0% better bus utilization vs real-world network. Under mixed-mode: 68.8% higher route efficiency vs demand coverage heuristics, 5.9% lower travel times vs shortest path construction.

Conclusion: End-to-end RL can design transit networks that substantially outperform both human-designed systems and hand-crafted heuristics on realistic city-scale benchmarks.

Abstract: Designing efficient transit route networks is an NP-hard problem with exponentially large solution spaces that traditionally relies on manual planning processes. We present an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on graph attention networks for sequential transit network construction. To address the long-horizon credit assignment challenge, we introduce a two-level reward structure combining incremental topological feedback with simulation-based terminal rewards. We evaluate our approach on a new real-world dataset from Bloomington, Indiana with topologically accurate road networks, census-derived demand, and existing transit routes. Our learned policies substantially outperform existing designs and traditional heuristics across two initialization schemes and two modal-split scenarios. Under high transit adoption with transit center initialization, our approach achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9\% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization compared to the real-world network. Under mixed-mode conditions with random initialization, it delivers 68.8% higher route efficiency than demand coverage heuristics and 5.9% lower travel times than shortest path construction. These results demonstrate that end-to-end RL can design transit networks that substantially outperform both human-designed systems and hand-crafted heuristics on realistic city-scale benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducibility is essential in ML for scientific integrity and debugging. The paper aims to investigate repeatability issues in popular clustering algorithms to raise awareness among users and developers.

Method: Decomposed K-Means, DBSCAN, and Ward clustering algorithms into fundamental steps, identified conditions for repeatability at each stage, and examined implementations using Python's scikit-learn library.

Conclusion: The work highlights reproducibility problems in widely-used clustering algorithms and aims to raise awareness among users and developers to encourage further investigation and potential fixes for these issues.

Abstract: Reproducibility is essential in machine learning because it ensures that a model or experiment yields the same scientific conclusion. For specific algorithms repeatability with bitwise identical results is also a key for scientific integrity because it allows debugging. We decomposed several very popular clustering algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN and Ward into their fundamental steps, and we identify the conditions required to achieve repeatability at each stage. We use an implementation example with the Python library scikit-learn to examine the repeatable aspects of each method. Our results reveal inconsistent results with K-Means when the number of OpenMP threads exceeds two. This work aims to raise awareness of this issue among both users and developers, encouraging further investigation and potential fixes.

### [160] [Reduced Order Modeling for Tsunami Forecasting with Bayesian Hierarchical Pooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19804)
*Shane X. Coffing,John Tipton,Arvind T. Mohan,Darren Engwirda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new reduced order model called randPROM uses neural Galerkin projections and statistical pooling to generate physics-based tsunami simulations that generalize across similar problems with statistical interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ROMs like proper orthogonal decomposition are constrained to specific processes they model and lack generalization capabilities. There's a need for ROMs that can generate statistically interpretable and physically justified simulations for unpredictable catastrophic events like tsunamis across multiple similar scenarios.

Method: Combines neural Galerkin projections (neural networks encoding PDE physics) with statistical hierarchical pooling to learn distributions on initial temporal weights. This creates generalized, statistically interpretable weights that can be recombined with spatial features to form randPROM - a physics surrogate for generating simulations consistent with a neighborhood of initial conditions.

Result: Applied to both synthetic tsunamis near Fiji and real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster. Demonstrated significant reduction in simulations needed to generate statistically calibrated and physically defensible predictions for tsunami wave arrival time and height.

Conclusion: randPROMs enable creation of physics surrogates that generalize across similar problems while maintaining statistical interpretability and physical justification, particularly valuable for unpredictable catastrophic events like tsunamis where computational efficiency and generalization are critical.

Abstract: Reduced order models (ROM) can represent spatiotemporal processes in significantly fewer dimensions and can be solved many orders faster than their governing partial differential equations (PDEs). For example, using a proper orthogonal decomposition produces a ROM that is a small linear combination of fixed features and weights, but that is constrained to the given process it models. In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems. When recombined with the spatial features, we form a complete physics surrogate, called a randPROM, for generating simulations that are consistent in distribution to a neighborhood of initial conditions close to those used to construct the ROM. We apply the randPROM technique to the study of tsunamis, which are unpredictable, catastrophic, and highly-detailed non-linear problems, modeling both a synthetic case of tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster. We demonstrate that randPROMs may enable us to significantly reduce the number of simulations needed to generate a statistically calibrated and physically defensible prediction model for arrival time and height of tsunami waves.

### [161] [Guardrailed Uplift Targeting: A Causal Optimization Playbook for Marketing Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19805)
*Deepit Sapru*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A marketing framework that uses uplift modeling and constrained optimization to target customers with offers while respecting business constraints like budget and customer experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marketers need to target customers with offers that maximize revenue and retention, but must do so within business constraints like budget limits and acceptable sales deterioration. Traditional approaches lack the ability to incorporate these constraints while optimizing for heterogeneous treatment effects.

Method: Estimates Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) using uplift learners, then solves a constrained allocation problem to determine who to target and which offer to deploy under limits like budget or acceptable sales deterioration.

Result: Outperforms propensity and static baselines in offline evaluations using uplift AUC, IPS, and SNIPS metrics. Production A/B tests validate strategic lift on revenue and completion while preserving customer-experience constraints.

Conclusion: Provides a reusable playbook for marketers to operationalize causal targeting at scale, set guardrails, and align campaigns with strategic KPIs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a marketing decision framework that converts heterogeneous-treatment uplift into constrained targeting strategies to maximize revenue and retention while honoring business guardrails. The approach estimates Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) with uplift learners and then solves a constrained allocation to decide who to target and which offer to deploy under limits such as budget or acceptable sales deterioration. Applied to retention messaging, event rewards, and spend-threshold assignment, the framework consistently outperforms propensity and static baselines in offline evaluations using uplift AUC, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS). A production-scale online A/B test further validates strategic lift on revenue and completion while preserving customer-experience constraints. The result is a reusable playbook for marketers to operationalize causal targeting at scale, set guardrails, and align campaigns with strategic KPIs.

*Jorg Bornschein,Clare Lyle,Yazhe Li,Amal Rannen-Triki,Xu Owen He,Razvan Pascanu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified approach combining fine-tuning with in-context learning that bridges prompt engineering and parameter optimization, outperforming both methods across data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM adaptation approaches have limitations: prompt engineering plateaus with more data, while fine-tuning underperforms with scarce data. There's a need for a method that combines the strengths of both paradigms.

Method: Fine-tune models on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples (mimicking k-shot prompts), using prequential evaluation for hyperparameter selection in low-data regimes to avoid expensive cross-validation.

Result: The unified approach consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both fine-tuning and in-context learning baselines across different data regimes.

Conclusion: Combining in-context learning with fine-tuning creates a more effective adaptation method that leverages the sample efficiency of prompting with the performance gains of parameter optimization, with prequential evaluation enabling efficient hyperparameter tuning in low-data scenarios.

Abstract: When adapting large language models (LLMs) to a specific downstream task, two primary approaches are commonly employed: (1) prompt engineering, often with in-context few-shot learning, leveraging the model's inherent generalization abilities, and (2) fine-tuning on task-specific data, directly optimizing the model's parameters. While prompt-based methods excel in few-shot scenarios, their effectiveness often plateaus as more data becomes available. Conversely, fine-tuning scales well with data but may underperform when training examples are scarce. We investigate a unified approach that bridges these two paradigms by incorporating in-context learning directly into the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we fine-tune the model on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, mimicking the structure of k-shot prompts. This approach, while requiring per-task fine-tuning, combines the sample efficiency of in-context learning with the performance gains of fine-tuning, leading to a method that consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both these baselines. To perform hyperparameter selection in the low-data regime, we propose to use prequential evaluation, which eliminates the need for expensive cross-validation and leverages all available data for training while simultaneously providing a robust validation signal. We conduct an extensive empirical study to determine which adaptation paradigm - fine-tuning, in-context learning, or our proposed unified approach offers the best predictive performance on a concrete data downstream-tasks.

### [163] [Demystifying LLM-as-a-Judge: Analytically Tractable Model for Inference-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19905)
*Indranil Halder,Cengiz Pehlevan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes inference-time scaling in LLMs using a Bayesian linear regression model, showing how generalization error changes with inference samples, reward specification, and temperature settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the principles behind inference-time scaling in large language models, as current approaches shift computational resources from training to inference without clear theoretical foundations.

Method: Uses Bayesian linear regression with reward-weighted sampling, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario in high-dimensional regime. Analyzes generalization error with training data from teacher model, studying effects of inference samples (k), reward specification, and sampling temperature.

Result: Generalization error decreases with more inference samples when reward is close to teacher, but reward misspecification creates optimal finite k. Optimal sampling temperature exists for fixed k. In best-of-k limit with teacher reward, error decays as Θ(1/k²). Task difficulty degrades inference-time compute advantages.

Conclusion: Theoretical framework explains when inference-time scaling is beneficial vs. collecting more data. Reward alignment is crucial - substantial misspecification harms scaling. Practical implications for LLM inference optimization and resource allocation between training and inference compute.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models have shown advantages in reallocating a notable share of computational resource from training time to inference time. However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler, where the reward is determined from a linear model, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario. We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward. When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error. For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature. We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge. In the "best-of-$k$" limit with the teacher as reward, we theoretically show that the generalization error decays as $Θ(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory. These formulas delineate domains where scaling inference-time computation is provably preferable to collecting more data. Finally, we demonstrate that when task difficulty increases, the previously mentioned advantage of inference-time compute degrades.

*Maxime Lacour,Pu Ren,Rie Nakata,Nori Nakata,Michael Mahoney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning approach (CGM-FAS) using Conditional Variational Autoencoder for non-ergodic ground-motion modeling, outperforming Gaussian Process methods in speed and scalability while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current non-ergodic ground-motion models use Gaussian Process methods with prescribed correlation functions, which have computational limitations for large-scale predictions and cannot efficiently capture interfrequency correlations.

Method: Proposes CGM-FAS (Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra) using Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture that learns spatial patterns and interfrequency correlations directly from data using geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables.

Result: CGM-FAS demonstrates consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects compared to GP-based GMM, can generate maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using minimal memory, and can be tuned to match GP-based model variability.

Conclusion: CGM-FAS offers a promising deep-learning alternative to GP-based methods for efficient non-ergodic ground-motion prediction across multiple frequencies and large spatial domains, with advantages in learning spatial patterns without prescribed correlation functions and capturing interfrequency correlations.

Abstract: Recent developments in non-ergodic ground-motion models (GMMs) explicitly model systematic spatial variations in source, site, and path effects, reducing standard deviation to 30-40% of ergodic models and enabling more accurate site-specific seismic hazard analysis. Current non-ergodic GMMs rely on Gaussian Process (GP) methods with prescribed correlation functions and thus have computational limitations for large-scale predictions. This study proposes a deep-learning approach called Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra (CGM-FAS) as an alternative to GP-based methods for modeling non-ergodic path effects in Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS). CGM-FAS uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlation directly from data by using geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables. Using San Francisco Bay Area earthquake data, we compare CGM-FAS against a recent GP-based GMM for the region and demonstrate consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects. Additionally, CGM-FAS offers advantages compared to GP-based approaches in learning spatial patterns without prescribed correlation functions, capturing interfrequency correlations, and enabling rapid predictions, generating maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using a few GB of memory. CGM-FAS hyperparameters can be tuned to ensure generated path effects exhibit variability consistent with the GP-based empirical GMM. This work demonstrates a promising direction for efficient non-ergodic ground-motion prediction across multiple frequencies and large spatial domains.

### [165] [Mitigating LLM Hallucination via Behaviorally Calibrated Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19920)
*Jiayun Wu,Jiashuo Liu,Zhiyuan Zeng,Tianyang Zhan,Wenhao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses LLM hallucinations by proposing behavioral calibration methods that train models to admit uncertainty and abstain when not confident, enabling smaller models to outperform frontier models in uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM hallucinations impede deployment in critical domains. Current RLHF paradigms inadvertently incentivize models to guess whenever correctness probability exceeds zero, prioritizing test-taking over honest communication. Hallucination is not just stochastic error but a predictable statistical consequence of training objectives that prioritize mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty.

Method: Proposes behavioral calibration training interventions that optimize strictly proper scoring rules for models to output calibrated probability of correctness. Methods enable models to either abstain from producing complete responses or flag individual uncertain claims. Uses Qwen3-4B-Instruct for empirical analysis with behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning.

Result: Behavior-calibrated smaller models surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification. On math reasoning tasks (BeyondAIME), log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio gain (0.806) exceeds GPT-5's (0.207). In cross-domain factual QA (SimpleQA), 4B LLM achieves zero-shot calibration error on par with frontier models (Grok-4, Gemini-2.5-Pro) despite much lower factual accuracy.

Conclusion: Behavioral calibration enables models to become honest communicators rather than good test-takers, allowing uncertainty quantification to be decoupled from raw predictive accuracy. This transferable meta-skill allows smaller models to outperform frontier models in calibration, addressing the hallucination problem in critical applications.

Abstract: LLM deployment in critical domains is currently impeded by persistent hallucinations--generating plausible but factually incorrect assertions. While scaling laws drove significant improvements in general capabilities, theoretical frameworks suggest hallucination is not merely stochastic error but a predictable statistical consequence of training objectives prioritizing mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty. Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy. Trained on math reasoning tasks, our model's log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio gain (0.806) exceeds GPT-5's (0.207) in a challenging in-domain evaluation (BeyondAIME). Moreover, in cross-domain factual QA (SimpleQA), our 4B LLM achieves zero-shot calibration error on par with frontier models including Grok-4 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, even though its factual accuracy is much lower.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Common Task Framework (CTF) for machine learning in seismology to standardize evaluation of wavefield forecasting and reconstruction methods across different scales and realistic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Seismology faces challenges in state forecasting/reconstruction (earthquake early warning, ground motion prediction) and managing parametric variability. Current approaches are limited by massive simulation scales, inadequate Earth models, sparse field measurements, and lack of proper ML evaluation standards with fair reporting and rigorous comparisons.

Method: Introduces a Common Task Framework (CTF) for ML in seismic wavefields featuring: 1) Three curated wavefield datasets at global, crustal, and local scales, 2) Task-specific metrics for forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization, 3) Realistic constraints including noise and limited data, 4) Structured head-to-head algorithm evaluation inspired by CTFs in NLP.

Result: The CTF evaluation procedure is demonstrated with scores reported for two datasets, showing performance of various methods and foundation models for reconstructing seismic wavefields from both simulated and real-world sensor measurements. The framework reveals strengths, limitations, and suitability of methods for specific problem classes.

Conclusion: The CTF provides a structured, rigorous foundation for standardized ML evaluation in seismology, aiming to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets to improve rigor and reproducibility in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Seismology faces fundamental challenges in state forecasting and reconstruction (e.g., earthquake early warning and ground motion prediction) and managing the parametric variability of source locations, mechanisms, and Earth models (e.g., subsurface structure and topography effects). Addressing these with simulations is hindered by their massive scale, both in synthetic data volumes and numerical complexity, while real-data efforts are constrained by models that inadequately reflect the Earth's complexity and by sparse sensor measurements from the field. Recent machine learning (ML) efforts offer promise, but progress is obscured by a lack of proper characterization, fair reporting, and rigorous comparisons. To address this, we introduce a Common Task Framework (CTF) for ML for seismic wavefields, starting with three distinct wavefield datasets. Our CTF features a curated set of datasets at various scales (global, crustal, and local) and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints such as noise and limited data. Inspired by CTFs in fields like natural language processing, this framework provides a structured and rigorous foundation for head-to-head algorithm evaluation. We illustrate the evaluation procedure with scores reported for two of the datasets, showcasing the performance of various methods and foundation models for reconstructing seismic wavefields from both simulated and real-world sensor measurements. The CTF scores reveal the strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific problem classes. Our vision is to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets, raising the bar for rigor and reproducibility in scientific ML.

*Samruddhi Baviskar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial vulnerability in financial ML models is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress, requiring regime-aware evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial ML models operate in nonstationary economic environments, but adversarial robustness is typically evaluated under static assumptions, ignoring how macroeconomic stress affects model vulnerability.

Method: Proposed regime-aware evaluation framework using volatility-based regime segmentation to condition robustness assessment on economic stress indicators. Used semantic auditing of model explanations with LLMs as interpretive governance layer.

Result: Models show comparable baseline performance across calm/stress periods, but under adversarial perturbations, stress regimes cause substantially greater degradation in accuracy, decision thresholds, and risk-sensitive outcomes, with increased false negative rates.

Conclusion: Adversarial robustness in financial ML is regime-dependent, motivating stress-aware approaches to model risk assessment in high-stakes financial deployments.

Abstract: Machine learning models used in financial decision systems operate in nonstationary economic environments, yet adversarial robustness is typically evaluated under static assumptions. This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for efficient data preprocessing that reduces memory usage while preserving privacy, without sacrificing classification accuracy in machine learning tasks.

Method: Use Bloom filter transform to encode each data sample into a compact bit array, then train various classifiers (XGBoost, DNN, CNN, Logistic Regression) on these encodings across six diverse datasets.

Result: Models trained on Bloom filter encodings achieve accuracy comparable to models trained on raw data or other transforms, while providing memory savings and privacy enhancement.

Conclusion: Bloom filter transform is an efficient preprocessing approach for diverse ML tasks that balances accuracy, memory efficiency, and privacy protection.

Abstract: We present a method that uses the Bloom filter transform to preprocess data for machine learning. Each sample is encoded into a compact, privacy-preserving bit array. This reduces memory use and protects the original data while keeping enough structure for accurate classification. We test the method on six datasets: SMS Spam Collection, ECG200, Adult 50K, CDC Diabetes, MNIST, and Fashion MNIST. Four classifiers are used: Extreme Gradient Boosting, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Logistic Regression. Results show that models trained on Bloom filter encodings achieve accuracy similar to models trained on raw data or other transforms. At the same time, the method provides memory savings while enhancing privacy. These results suggest that the Bloom filter transform is an efficient preprocessing approach for diverse machine learning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep forecasting models struggle with limited training data and noisy temporal dynamics, often using full-length windows that include high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Auxiliary variables with domain-specific information are underutilized, especially in few-shot settings.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches, 2) residual learner models high-frequency variations, 3) fine-tuned LLM refines predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets show LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: LoFT-LLM effectively addresses challenges in time-series forecasting by combining frequency-aware decomposition with LLM-based semantic calibration, demonstrating strong performance in noisy, data-limited domains.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting in real-world applications such as finance and energy often faces challenges due to limited training data and complex, noisy temporal dynamics. Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts. Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets demonstrate that LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CVSI unifies DSI and TSI score estimators using control variates to minimize variance across all noise levels, improving sample efficiency in diffusion model training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models need accurate score estimation of noise-perturbed target distributions. Existing estimators (DSI and TSI) have complementary variance problems: DSI has high variance at low noise, TSI at high noise. There's a need for a unified approach that minimizes variance across the entire noise spectrum.

Method: Proposes Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI) that unifies DSI and TSI within a control variates framework. Derives an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across all noise levels. CVSI serves as a plug-in estimator for both data-free sampler learning and inference-time diffusion sampling.

Result: CVSI provides a robust, low-variance score estimator that significantly enhances sample efficiency in both training (data-free sampler learning) and inference (diffusion sampling). The method theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum.

Conclusion: CVSI successfully reconciles the complementary variance trade-offs of DSI and TSI through principled control variates, offering a unified, efficient solution for score estimation in diffusion models that improves both training and inference performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a robust framework for sampling from unnormalized probability densities, which requires accurately estimating the score of the noise-perturbed target distribution. While the standard Denoising Score Identity (DSI) relies on data samples, access to the target energy function enables an alternative formulation via the Target Score Identity (TSI). However, these estimators face a fundamental variance trade-off: DSI exhibits high variance in low-noise regimes, whereas TSI suffers from high variance at high noise levels. In this work, we reconcile these approaches by unifying both estimators within the principled framework of control variates. We introduce the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI), deriving an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum. We demonstrate that CVSI serves as a robust, low-variance plug-in estimator that significantly enhances sample efficiency in both data-free sampler learning and inference-time diffusion sampling.

TL;DR: Proposes OGAB, a novel activation function with orthogonality and group-aware bias to address class imbalance in deep learning by enhancing feature distinguishability without explicit label supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance causes suboptimal classifier performance in deep learning. Existing approaches modify data preprocessing or post-processing, but there's a need to address imbalance directly during training at the embedding learning level.

Method: OGAB activation function incorporates: 1) Orthogonal transformations to preserve minority class information by maintaining feature independence, preventing majority class dominance; 2) Group-aware bias mechanism that automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without explicit supervision.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on both real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets, showing consistent performance improvements over both traditional and learnable activation functions.

Conclusion: Activation functions can introduce strong inductive biases to address complex data challenges like class imbalance. OGAB tackles imbalance during training at the embedding level, enabling direct integration with learning process without requiring explicit label information.

Abstract: Class imbalance is a common challenge in machine learning and data mining, often leading to suboptimal performance in classifiers. While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on both real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets, showing consistent performance improvements over both traditional and learnable activation functions.

Method: Proposes DecoKAN framework with: 1) Multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for decoupling and hierarchical signal decomposition into distinct frequency components; 2) Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) mixers for transparent and interpretable nonlinear modeling using spline-based mappings; 3) Symbolic analysis pipeline with sparsification, pruning, and symbolization to produce concise analytical expressions.

Result: DecoKAN achieves the lowest average Mean Squared Error on all tested real-world cryptocurrency datasets (BTC, ETH, XMR), consistently outperforming comprehensive suite of competitive state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: DecoKAN bridges the gap between predictive accuracy and model transparency, advancing trustworthy decision support within complex cryptocurrency markets by providing interpretable forecasting while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable forecasting of multivariate time series is crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of cryptocurrency markets in digital asset systems. Advanced deep learning methodologies, particularly Transformer-based and MLP-based architectures, have achieved competitive predictive performance in cryptocurrency forecasting tasks. However, cryptocurrency data is inherently composed of long-term socio-economic trends and local high-frequency speculative oscillations. Existing deep learning-based 'black-box' models fail to effectively decouple these composite dynamics or provide the interpretability needed for trustworthy financial decision-making. To overcome these limitations, we propose DecoKAN, an interpretable forecasting framework that integrates multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for decoupling and hierarchical signal decomposition with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) mixers for transparent and interpretable nonlinear modeling. The DWT component decomposes complex cryptocurrency time series into distinct frequency components, enabling frequency-specific analysis, while KAN mixers provide intrinsically interpretable spline-based mappings within each decomposed subseries. Furthermore, interpretability is enhanced through a symbolic analysis pipeline involving sparsification, pruning, and symbolization, which produces concise analytical expressions offering symbolic representations of the learned patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DecoKAN achieves the lowest average Mean Squared Error on all tested real-world cryptocurrency datasets (BTC, ETH, XMR), consistently outperforming a comprehensive suite of competitive state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate DecoKAN's potential to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and model transparency, advancing trustworthy decision support within complex cryptocurrency markets.

### [174] [An Optimal Policy for Learning Controllable Dynamics by Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20053)
*Peter N. Loxley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Optimal exploration policy for learning controllable Markov chains with time-limited exploration, using greedy information maximization with time-varying control constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need efficient exploration policies for learning controllable dynamics in unknown environments with limited time horizons, addressing challenges from special state types (transient, absorbing, non-backtracking) that require non-stationary policies.

Method: Develops a general optimal policy form for exploration that maximizes information gain greedily, with time-varying control constraints. Provides parameterization for control sets and algorithm for finding optimal policy, addressing special state types that restrict dynamics control.

Result: Presents simple-to-implement, efficient-to-compute optimal exploration policy, demonstrates optimality using counting arguments, comparison with suboptimal policies, and dynamic programming sequential improvement property across six detailed examples.

Conclusion: Non-stationary policies are essential for optimal exploration due to special state types, and the proposed greedy information-maximizing approach provides effective solution for learning controllable dynamics with limited exploration time.

Abstract: Controllable Markov chains describe the dynamics of sequential decision making tasks and are the central component in optimal control and reinforcement learning. In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming.

*Mingue Park,Jisung Hwang,Seungwoo Yoo,Kyeongmin Yeo,Minhyuk Sung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PairFlow is a lightweight preprocessing method for Discrete Flow Models that enables few-step sampling without needing a pretrained teacher, achieving performance comparable to finetuning with only 1.7% of training compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete Flow Models (DFMs) are powerful generative models for discrete data but suffer from slow iterative sampling. Existing acceleration methods require expensive finetuning with substantial training overhead, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: PairFlow trains DFMs from coupled source-target distribution samples without a pretrained teacher. The core innovation is a closed-form inversion for DFMs that enables efficient construction of paired source-target samples, making it a lightweight preprocessing step.

Result: PairFlow matches or surpasses the performance of two-stage finetuning approaches while using only up to 1.7% of the compute needed for full model training. It also provides stronger base models for subsequent distillation, enabling further acceleration after finetuning.

Conclusion: PairFlow offers a highly efficient preprocessing framework for accelerating Discrete Flow Models, demonstrating broad applicability across molecular data, binary images, and RGB images while maintaining strong performance with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{PairFlow}$, a lightweight preprocessing step for training Discrete Flow Models (DFMs) to achieve few-step sampling without requiring a pretrained teacher. DFMs have recently emerged as a new class of generative models for discrete data, offering strong performance. However, they suffer from slow sampling due to their iterative nature. Existing acceleration methods largely depend on finetuning, which introduces substantial additional training overhead. $\texttt{PairFlow}$ addresses this issue with a lightweight preprocessing step. Inspired by ReFlow and its extension to DFMs, we train DFMs from coupled samples of source and target distributions, without requiring any pretrained teacher. At the core of our approach is a closed-form inversion for DFMs, which allows efficient construction of paired source-target samples. Despite its extremely low cost, taking only up to 1.7% of the compute needed for full model training, $\texttt{PairFlow}$ matches or even surpasses the performance of two-stage training involving finetuning. Furthermore, models trained with our framework provide stronger base models for subsequent distillation, yielding further acceleration after finetuning. Experiments on molecular data as well as binary and RGB images demonstrate the broad applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

*Yanjie Li,Jian Xu,Xueqing Chen,Lina Yu,Shiming Xiang,Weijun Li,Cheng-lin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QE-Catalytic: A multimodal framework combining large language model (Qwen) with E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (Equiformer-V2) for improved adsorption energy prediction and inverse design of catalytic surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language-model-based approaches for adsorption energy prediction have insufficient accuracy and struggle to distinguish different configurations of the same system, even with graph-assisted pretraining. There's a need for better methods that can leverage both 3D structural information and textual descriptions.

Method: Proposes QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (Qwen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (Equiformer-V2). The system jointly leverages 3D structures and structured configuration text, injecting geometric information into the language channel via graph-text alignment. It can function as a text-based predictor when coordinates are unavailable and autoregressively generate CIF files for structure design.

Result: On OC20 dataset, reduces MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713 eV to 0.486 eV. Consistently outperforms baseline models like CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: QE-Catalytic successfully addresses limitations of previous approaches by deeply coupling language and graph models, enabling both accurate adsorption energy prediction and inverse design capabilities for catalytic surfaces.

Abstract: Adsorption energy is a key descriptor of catalytic reactivity. It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa.
  To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion. On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713~eV to 0.486~eV, and consistently outperforms baseline models such as CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.

*Jeehong Kim,Youngseok Hwang,Minchan Kim,Sungho Bae,Hyunwoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in maritime traffic using spatio-temporal graph neural networks, addressing challenges of non-grid environments with multi-granularity anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ST-GNNs work well in structured domains with fixed nodes (like road traffic), but maritime traffic lacks fixed anchors, making graph construction and anomaly detection challenging due to sparse/irregular trajectories and multi-granularity anomalies.

Method: Extends OMTAD into a benchmark for graph-based anomaly detection with three granularities (node, edge, graph-level). Uses two LLM-based agents: Trajectory Synthesizer for richer interaction contexts and Anomaly Injector for semantically meaningful anomalies.

Result: A novel benchmark dataset for maritime anomaly detection that enables systematic evaluation across different granularities, promoting reproducibility and methodological advances.

Conclusion: This benchmark addresses fundamental challenges in non-grid spatio-temporal systems and is expected to foster progress in anomaly detection for maritime and similar domains.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) have achieved notable success in structured domains such as road traffic and public transportation, where spatial entities can be naturally represented as fixed nodes. In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies. We plan to employ two specialized LLM-based agents: \emph{Trajectory Synthesizer} and \emph{Anomaly Injector} to construct richer interaction contexts and generate semantically meaningful anomalies. We expect this benchmark to promote reproducibility and to foster methodological advances in anomaly detection for non-grid spatio-temporal systems.

*Zuo Wang,Ye Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JSDMP is a new learning paradigm for rich-text graph representation learning that captures both similarity and dissimilarity between structural and contextual information using Jensen-Shannon divergence, leading to improved performance over state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the problem of contextual and structural divergence in rich-text graphs, where traditional methods may not effectively capture the complex relationships between text nodes due to misalignment between structural connections and semantic content.

Method: Proposes Jensen-Shannon Divergence Message-Passing (JSDMP) paradigm that computes message weights among text nodes by jointly considering similarity and dissimilarity between structural and contextual information. Introduces two novel GNNs: DMPGCN (Divergent message-passing graph convolutional network) and DMPPRG (Divergent message-passing Page-Rank graph neural networks).

Result: Extensive experiments on well-established rich-text datasets show that both DMPGCN and DMPPRG outperform several state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the JSDMP paradigm.

Conclusion: The proposed JSDMP paradigm successfully addresses contextual and structural divergence in rich-text graphs by capturing both similarity and dissimilarity, leading to more effective representation learning through truly correlated text nodes.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how the widely existing contextual and structural divergence may influence the representation learning in rich-text graphs. To this end, we propose Jensen-Shannon Divergence Message-Passing (JSDMP), a new learning paradigm for rich-text graph representation learning. Besides considering similarity regarding structure and text, JSDMP further captures their corresponding dissimilarity by Jensen-Shannon divergence. Similarity and dissimilarity are then jointly used to compute new message weights among text nodes, thus enabling representations to learn with contextual and structural information from truly correlated text nodes. With JSDMP, we propose two novel graph neural networks, namely Divergent message-passing graph convolutional network (DMPGCN) and Divergent message-passing Page-Rank graph neural networks (DMPPRG), for learning representations in rich-text graphs. DMPGCN and DMPPRG have been extensively texted on well-established rich-text datasets and compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. The experimental results show that DMPGCN and DMPPRG can outperform other baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed Jensen-Shannon Divergence Message-Passing paradigm

### [179] [Sample-Efficient Policy Constraint Offline Deep Reinforcement Learning based on Sample Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20115)
*Yuanhao Chen,Qi Liu,Pengbin Chen,Zhongjian Qiao,Yanjie Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a sample filtering method for policy constraint offline RL that selects high-score transitions to improve learning speed and performance when datasets contain many low-reward transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy constraint offline RL methods suffer when datasets contain many low-reward transitions, causing learned policies to be constrained by suboptimal behavior policies, leading to slow learning and poor performance.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) Score transitions using average reward and average discounted reward of episodes, 2) Filter to extract high-score transitions, 3) Use only these high-score transitions to train offline RL algorithms.

Result: Experimental results across various offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks show the proposed filtering method outperforms baseline methods that use all transitions.

Conclusion: Simple but effective sample filtering based on transition scores improves sample efficiency and final performance in policy constraint offline RL, especially when dealing with datasets containing many low-reward transitions.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy that maximizes the expected return using a given static dataset of transitions. However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using expectation-maximization (EM) to formalize reasoning in LLMs as a latent variable model, comparing different sampling schemes for generating rationales that justify correct answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs solve reasoning problems by generating rationales then answers, but there's a need to formalize this process and optimize how rationales are generated to improve reasoning accuracy.

Method: Formalize reasoning as latent variable model with EM objective, instantiate and compare sampling schemes: rejection sampling with budget, STaR (self-taught reasoner), and PPS (prompt posterior sampling).

Result: Experiments on ARC, MMLU, and OpenBookQA datasets with Llama and Qwen models show sampling scheme significantly affects accuracy; PPS outperforms other schemes despite its simplicity.

Conclusion: The EM framework connects traditional optimization with modern reward-based methods, and PPS emerges as an effective sampling approach for learning to reason in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) solve reasoning problems by first generating a rationale and then answering. We formalize reasoning as a latent variable model and derive an expectation-maximization (EM) objective for learning to reason. This view connects EM and modern reward-based optimization, and shows that the main challenge lies in designing a sampling distribution that generates rationales that justify correct answers. We instantiate and compare several sampling schemes: rejection sampling with a budget, self-taught reasoner (STaR), and prompt posterior sampling (PPS), which only keeps the rationalization stage of STaR. Our experiments on the ARC, MMLU, and OpenBookQA datasets with the Llama and Qwen models show that the sampling scheme can significantly affect the accuracy of learned reasoning models. Despite its simplicity, we observe that PPS outperforms the other sampling schemes.

TL;DR: NeuralCrop is a hybrid crop model combining process-based global gridded crop models with machine learning, outperforming both traditional GGCMs and pure ML models, especially under extreme conditions like drought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional process-based GGCMs have substantial uncertainties due to limited process understanding, while pure machine learning models trained on observational data fail to generalize to changing climate conditions outside their training distributions.

Method: NeuralCrop combines an advanced process-based GGCM with data-driven ML components. It's first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM, then fine-tuned on observational data to create a hybrid model.

Result: NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions, particularly under drought extremes. It accurately reproduces interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and US Corn Belt (2000-2019) and maintains robust projections when generalizing to unseen conditions.

Conclusion: The hybrid crop modeling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions, addressing limitations of both traditional GGCMs and pure ML models.

Abstract: Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) simulate daily crop growth by explicitly representing key biophysical processes and project end-of-season yield time series. They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions.

TL;DR: Multitask offline RL with shared low-rank representations improves statistical efficiency via joint learning across tasks, achieving 1/√(nT) sample dependence and better downstream generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve statistical efficiency and generalization in offline RL when multiple related tasks share underlying structure, enabling better learning from fixed datasets without online interaction.

Method: Multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration that jointly learns shared low-rank representation and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on offline data from multiple tasks.

Result: Established finite-sample generalization guarantees showing 1/√(nT) dependence on total samples across tasks, with standard horizon and concentrability dependencies. Downstream representation reuse reduces effective complexity for new tasks sharing same representation.

Conclusion: Shared representations in multitask offline Q-learning improve generalization and statistical efficiency, providing theoretical insight into when and how multitask structure benefits model-free, value-based RL.

Abstract: We study offline multitask reinforcement learning in settings where multiple tasks share a low-rank representation of their action-value functions. In this regime, a learner is provided with fixed datasets collected from several related tasks, without access to further online interaction, and seeks to exploit shared structure to improve statistical efficiency and generalization. We analyze a multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration that jointly learns a shared representation and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on offline data. Under standard realizability and coverage assumptions commonly used in offline reinforcement learning, we establish finite-sample generalization guarantees for the learned value functions. Our analysis explicitly characterizes how pooling data across tasks improves estimation accuracy, yielding a $1/\sqrt{nT}$ dependence on the total number of samples across tasks, while retaining the usual dependence on the horizon and concentrability coefficients arising from distribution shift. In addition, we consider a downstream offline setting in which a new task shares the same underlying representation as the upstream tasks. We study how reusing the representation learned during the multitask phase affects value estimation for this new task, and show that it can reduce the effective complexity of downstream learning relative to learning from scratch. Together, our results clarify the role of shared representations in multitask offline Q-learning and provide theoretical insight into when and how multitask structure can improve generalization in model-free, value-based reinforcement learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simultaneous load forecasting across multiple entities is crucial for power system operation, but existing methods are limited to offline learning and cannot capture dynamic changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities.

Method: Proposes an adaptive multi-task learning method based on vector-valued hidden Markov models with a recursive process to update model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters.

Result: The method outperforms existing methods in both forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment when evaluated on datasets with diverse and dynamic consumption patterns.

Conclusion: The adaptive multi-task learning approach provides reliable probabilistic predictions for multiple entities while dynamically adapting to changing patterns and correlations, addressing limitations of existing offline methods.

Abstract: Simultaneous load forecasting across multiple entities (e.g., regions, buildings) is crucial for the efficient, reliable, and cost-effective operation of power systems. Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show state-of-the-art image synthesis but tend to replicate and amplify dataset biases, which remains poorly understood. Previous research viewed bias amplification as inherent to diffusion models, but this work investigates how sampling algorithms affect bias.

Method: Empirical analysis of how sampling algorithms and hyperparameters influence bias amplification. Controlled studies with models trained on Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST, BFFHQ, and Stable Diffusion, examining how sampling parameters affect bias even with fixed trained models.

Result: Samplers optimized for sample quality and speed have significant measurable effects on bias amplification. Sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification, demonstrating that bias is not solely inherent to the trained model.

Conclusion: Bias amplification in diffusion models is influenced by sampling algorithms and hyperparameters, not just model architecture or training data. This provides new opportunities for bias mitigation through careful sampling parameter selection.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various image synthesis tasks, yet their tendency to replicate and amplify dataset biases remains poorly understood. Although previous research has viewed bias amplification as an inherent characteristic of diffusion models, this work provides the first analysis of how sampling algorithms and their hyperparameters influence bias amplification. We empirically demonstrate that samplers for diffusion models -- commonly optimized for sample quality and speed -- have a significant and measurable effect on bias amplification. Through controlled studies with models trained on Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST and BFFHQ, and with Stable Diffusion, we show that sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification, even when the trained model is fixed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop fast, accurate emulators for moving boundary systems that can be integrated into digital twin platforms, specifically for monitoring and controlling Resin Transfer Moulding processes where traditional inversion methods are computationally expensive.

Method: Uses Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture to build efficient surrogate models for moving boundary problems in single-phase Darcy flow, coupled with Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm for Bayesian inverse problems.

Result: The DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared to full-model EKI, enabling real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of permeability, porosity, and other parameters for RTM processes using both synthetic and experimental data.

Conclusion: Neural operator learning provides a powerful framework for building practical digital twins for moving boundary systems, with generalization across spatial/temporal domains and arbitrary sensor configurations without retraining, representing significant progress toward industrial deployment.

Abstract: This work demonstrates that neural operator learning provides a powerful and flexible framework for building fast, accurate emulators of moving boundary systems, enabling their integration into digital twin platforms. To this end, a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture is employed to construct an efficient surrogate model for moving boundary problems in single-phase Darcy flow through porous media. The surrogate enables rapid and accurate approximation of complex flow dynamics and is coupled with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems.
  The proposed inversion framework is demonstrated by estimating the permeability and porosity of fibre reinforcements for composite materials manufactured via the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) process. Using both synthetic and experimental in-process data, the DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared with full-model EKI. This computational efficiency enables real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters, thereby supporting effective monitoring and control of RTM processes, as well as other applications involving moving boundary flows. Unlike prior approaches for RTM inversion that learn mesh-dependent mappings, the proposed neural operator generalises across spatial and temporal domains, enabling evaluation at arbitrary sensor configurations without retraining, and represents a significant step toward practical industrial deployment of digital twins.

TL;DR: HGAN-SDEs: A GAN framework using Neural Hermite functions as efficient discriminators for learning SDE-driven distributions, offering improved stability and computational efficiency over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural SDEs are important for modeling continuous-time stochastic processes, but existing GAN approaches using Neural CDEs as discriminators suffer from high computational costs and training instability. There's a need for a more efficient and stable discriminator design.

Method: Introduces HGAN-SDEs, a GAN framework that leverages Neural Hermite functions to construct structured, efficient discriminators. Hermite functions provide an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics, reducing runtime complexity while maintaining expressive power.

Result: The framework establishes universal approximation property for broad SDE-driven distributions and theoretically characterizes convergence behavior. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world systems show superior sample quality and learning efficiency compared to existing generative models for SDEs.

Conclusion: HGAN-SDEs successfully address the computational and stability limitations of prior approaches by using Neural Hermite functions as discriminators, offering a more practical and effective solution for learning complex SDE-driven distributions.

Abstract: Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) provide a principled framework for modeling continuous-time stochastic processes and have been widely adopted in fields ranging from physics to finance. Recent advances suggest that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a promising solution to learning the complex path distributions induced by SDEs. However, a critical bottleneck lies in designing a discriminator that faithfully captures temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Prior works have explored Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) as discriminators due to their ability to model continuous-time dynamics, but such architectures suffer from high computational costs and exacerbate the instability of adversarial training. To address these limitations, we introduce HGAN-SDEs, a novel GAN-based framework that leverages Neural Hermite functions to construct a structured and efficient discriminator. Hermite functions provide an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics, enabling both reduced runtime complexity and improved training stability. We establish the universal approximation property of our framework for a broad class of SDE-driven distributions and theoretically characterize its convergence behavior. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world systems demonstrate that HGAN-SDEs achieve superior sample quality and learning efficiency compared to existing generative models for SDEs

TL;DR: TableGPT-R1 is a specialized tabular model using reinforcement learning to enhance multi-step reasoning and code execution for complex table tasks, overcoming challenges like scarce training data, heterogeneous feedback, and catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs fine-tuned via SFT fall short in handling complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. RL offers promise but faces three critical hurdles: scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories, extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals, and risk of catastrophic forgetting during specialization.

Method: TableGPT-R1 uses a systematic RL framework with: 1) comprehensive data engineering pipeline synthesizing difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories, 2) task-adaptive reward system combining rule-based verification with criteria-injected reward model and process-level step reward shaping, and 3) multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing.

Result: Extensive evaluations show TableGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on authoritative benchmarks, significantly outperforming baseline models while retaining robust general capabilities.

Conclusion: TableGPT-R1 successfully overcomes RL challenges in the tabular domain and unlocks advanced reasoning on complex tables through its systematic framework, demonstrating superior performance while maintaining general capabilities.

Abstract: Tabular data serves as the backbone of modern data analysis and scientific research. While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TableGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on authoritative benchmarks, significantly outperforming baseline models while retaining robust general capabilities.

*Yuxing Gan,Ziyu Lei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CDSP-MoE addresses MoE limitations (catastrophic forgetting and instruction-overfitting) by shifting from isolated experts to dynamic expert instantiation in shared subspaces, using gradient conflicts as structural supervision to prune interfering connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE architectures suffer from structural parameter isolation causing catastrophic forgetting, and instruction-overfitting that degrades performance in instruction-free scenarios. There's a need for more robust MoE designs that maintain semantic specialization without explicit task labels.

Method: CDSP-MoE maintains a super-complete parameter backbone where logical experts are carved out via learnable topology masks. It uses a Lagged Gradient Game that penalizes interfering connections in the shared manifold, enabling spontaneous pruning of conflicting pathways and evolution of interpretable modular structures.

Result: CDSP-MoE achieves robust content-driven routing without human-defined task labels, maintaining semantic specialization even under strict blind inference protocols where explicit instructions are absent.

Conclusion: The proposed conflict-driven subspace pruning approach effectively addresses fundamental MoE limitations through dynamic expert instantiation in shared physical subspaces, using gradient conflicts as structural supervision rather than just optimization signals.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures achieve parameter efficiency through conditional computation, yet contemporary designs suffer from two fundamental limitations: structural parameter isolation that causes catastrophic forgetting, and instruction-overfitting that degrades performance in instruction-free scenarios. We propose CDSP-MoE (Conflict-Driven Subspace Pruning MoE), a framework that addresses these issues through a paradigm shift from isolated expert containers to dynamic expert instantiation within a shared physical subspace. Grounded in the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis, CDSP-MoE maintains a super-complete parameter backbone where logical experts are carved out via learnable topology masks. Unlike prior work that uses gradient conflict for token reassignment or optimization surgery, we leverage it as a structural supervisory signal: a Lagged Gradient Game penalizes interfering connections in the shared manifold, enabling the topology to spontaneously prune conflicting pathways and evolve interpretable modular structures. Experimental results demonstrate that CDSP-MoE achieves robust content-driven routing without human-defined task labels, maintaining semantic specialization even under strict blind inference protocols where explicit instructions are absent.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Clust-PSI-PFL: A clustering-based personalized federated learning framework that uses Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify non-IID data and form homogeneous client groups, achieving better accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning suffers from performance degradation due to non-IID data across clients, which biases model updates. Existing methods need better ways to quantify and handle data heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes Clust-PSI-PFL framework that: 1) Uses weighted PSI metric (WPSI^L) to quantify non-IID data, 2) Forms distributionally homogeneous client groups via K-means++ clustering on PSI features, 3) Uses silhouette-based procedure to determine optimal cluster number, 4) Enables personalized FL within clusters.

Result: Achieves up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines across six datasets (tabular, image, text) and multiple client sizes. Improves client fairness by 37% relative improvement under severe non-IID data. Shows WPSI^L is more informative than common non-IID metrics.

Conclusion: PSI-guided clustering provides a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust personalized federated learning under label skew, effectively handling non-IID data challenges.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) supports privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning (ML) model training by keeping data on client devices. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew.

### [191] [FedDPC : Handling Data Heterogeneity and Partial Client Participation in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20329)
*Mrinmay Sen,Subhrajit Nag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDPC is a novel federated learning method that addresses both data heterogeneity and partial client participation by projecting local updates onto previous global updates and using adaptive scaling to accelerate training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity creates variance in local model updates, causing the global model to shift from the true optimum. Partial client participation exacerbates this by skewing aggregation toward participating clients' data distributions, leading to instability, degraded performance, and slower training. Existing work focuses mainly on data heterogeneity, with less attention to partial client participation.

Method: FedDPC projects each local update onto the previous global update to control variance in both local and global updates. It also employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation to accelerate FL training.

Result: Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets show FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds.

Conclusion: FedDPC effectively mitigates both data heterogeneity and partial client participation challenges in federated learning, leading to more stable training, better global model performance, and faster convergence compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a significant challenge in modern federated learning (FL) as it creates variance in local model updates, causing the aggregated global model to shift away from the true global optimum. Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC. The results demonstrate that FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds.

### [192] [Simplifying Multi-Task Architectures Through Task-Specific Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20420)
*Mihai Suteu,Ovidiu Serban*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Task-specific normalization layers alone can effectively address multi-task learning challenges, eliminating need for complex architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MTL approaches use complex task-specific modules/routing schemes that increase overhead; need simpler, more efficient solutions.

Method: Propose Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TSσBN) - lightweight mechanism using task-specific normalization layers with learned gates for soft capacity allocation while sharing feature extractors.

Result: TSσBN improves stability across CNNs/Transformers, matches/exceeds performance on NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, PascalContext while being parameter-efficient; gates provide interpretable insights into MTL dynamics.

Conclusion: Complex MTL architectures may be unnecessary; task-specific normalization offers simple, interpretable, efficient alternative to elaborate designs.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to leverage shared knowledge across tasks to improve generalization and parameter efficiency, yet balancing resources and mitigating interference remain open challenges. Architectural solutions often introduce elaborate task-specific modules or routing schemes, increasing complexity and overhead. In this work, we show that normalization layers alone are sufficient to address many of these challenges. Simply replacing shared normalization with task-specific variants already yields competitive performance, questioning the need for complex designs. Building on this insight, we propose Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TS$σ$BN), a lightweight mechanism that enables tasks to softly allocate network capacity while fully sharing feature extractors. TS$σ$BN improves stability across CNNs and Transformers, matching or exceeding performance on NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, and PascalContext, while remaining highly parameter-efficient. Moreover, its learned gates provide a natural framework for analyzing MTL dynamics, offering interpretable insights into capacity allocation, filter specialization, and task relationships. Our findings suggest that complex MTL architectures may be unnecessary and that task-specific normalization offers a simple, interpretable, and efficient alternative.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-based ML accelerates ALICE ZDC simulations using novel loss functions and Normalizing Flows, achieving 421x speedup over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate simulations of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) in the ALICE experiment at CERN by blending physics knowledge with data-driven techniques for more accurate and robust models.

Method: Uses physics-based machine learning with a novel loss function and output variability-based scaling mechanism. Employs Normalizing Flows in a teacher-student generative framework to accurately represent particle shower spatial distributions while mitigating rare artefact influence.

Result: The approach outperforms classic data-driven model assimilation and achieves models that are 421 times faster than existing Normalizing Flow implementations in ZDC simulation literature.

Conclusion: Physics-based machine learning with specialized loss functions and scaling mechanisms can significantly accelerate particle detector simulations while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to purely data-driven approaches.

Abstract: Physics-based machine learning blends traditional science with modern data-driven techniques. Rather than relying exclusively on empirical data or predefined equations, this methodology embeds domain knowledge directly into the learning process, resulting in models that are both more accurate and robust. We leverage this paradigm to accelerate simulations of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) of the ALICE experiment at CERN. Our method introduces a novel loss function and an output variability-based scaling mechanism, which enhance the model's capability to accurately represent the spatial distribution and morphology of particle showers in detector outputs while mitigating the influence of rare artefacts on the training. Leveraging Normalizing Flows (NFs) in a teacher-student generative framework, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms classic data-driven model assimilation but also yields models that are 421 times faster than existing NF implementations in ZDC simulation literature.

*Dogan Altan,Hamza Haruna Mohammed,Glenn Terje Lines,Dusica Marijan,Arnbjørn Maressa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid physics-guided neural network approach for vessel shaft power prediction outperforms both traditional empirical formulas and baseline neural networks, achieving lower prediction errors across multiple cargo vessels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate shaft power prediction is crucial for optimizing maritime fuel consumption and reducing costs/emissions. Traditional empirical formulas struggle with dynamic conditions like sea states and vessel fouling, while pure neural networks lack physical constraints.

Method: A hybrid physics-guided neural network that incorporates empirical formulas within the network architecture, combining the advantages of both neural networks (flexibility) and traditional techniques (physical constraints).

Result: The physics-guided neural network achieved lower mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for all four tested cargo vessels compared to both empirical formula-based methods and baseline neural networks.

Conclusion: Integrating empirical formulas within neural networks creates a superior hybrid approach for vessel shaft power prediction, effectively combining physical knowledge with data-driven learning to handle dynamic maritime conditions better than either method alone.

Abstract: Optimizing maritime operations, particularly fuel consumption for vessels, is crucial, considering its significant share in global trade. As fuel consumption is closely related to the shaft power of a vessel, predicting shaft power accurately is a crucial problem that requires careful consideration to minimize costs and emissions. Traditional approaches, which incorporate empirical formulas, often struggle to model dynamic conditions, such as sea conditions or fouling on vessels. In this paper, we present a hybrid, physics-guided neural network-based approach that utilizes empirical formulas within the network to combine the advantages of both neural networks and traditional techniques. We evaluate the presented method using data obtained from four similar-sized cargo vessels and compare the results with those of a baseline neural network and a traditional approach that employs empirical formulas. The experimental results demonstrate that the physics-guided neural network approach achieves lower mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error for all tested vessels compared to both the empirical formula-based method and the base neural network.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Field-Space Attention: A new transformer mechanism for Earth system modeling that computes attention directly in physical space rather than latent space, preserving geometric structure and enabling interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning architectures for Earth system modeling often operate on discrete representations that don't preserve the continuous geometric structure of geophysical fields. This limits interpretability and makes it difficult to enforce scientific constraints.

Method: Introduces Field-Space Attention that maintains all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere. Uses fixed multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of input fields, enabling coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information.

Result: Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines for global temperature super-resolution on HEALPix grid, while requiring substantially fewer parameters.

Conclusion: Field-Space Attention provides a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling, allowing direct embedding of physical and statistical priors.

Abstract: Accurate and physically consistent modeling of Earth system dynamics requires machine-learning architectures that operate directly on continuous geophysical fields and preserve their underlying geometric structure. Here we introduce Field-Space attention, a mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space. By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling. These results position Field-Space Attention as a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks.

*Rui Pan,Zhuofu Chen,Ravi Netravali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FailFast uses diffusion LLMs as drafters in speculative decoding to achieve up to 4.9× speedup by dynamically adapting speculation length - failing fast in hard regions and winning big in easy ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion LLMs offer fast parallel token generation but suffer from efficiency-quality tradeoffs when used standalone. The paper aims to leverage dLLMs' strengths as drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive verifiers.

Method: FailFast framework uses dLLM-based speculative decoding with dynamic adaptation of speculation length. It minimizes compute in hard-to-speculate regions (failing fast) and aggressively extends draft lengths in easier regions (winning big).

Result: Achieves up to 4.9× speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7× over best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4× over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads. Can speculate and accept up to 70 tokens at a time.

Conclusion: dLLMs can be effectively used as drafters in speculative decoding when combined with dynamic length adaptation. FailFast provides lossless acceleration without fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer fast, parallel token generation, but their standalone use is plagued by an inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff. We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It "fails fast" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and "wins big" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed for performative RL that converges to performatively optimal policies, outperforming standard RL methods and existing performative RL approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL methods ignore that deployed algorithms influence their environments and shift underlying dynamics, creating a performative setting that has been studied in supervised learning but remains under-explored in RL.

Method: Proved performative counterparts of performance difference lemma and policy gradient theorem, then introduced Performative Policy Gradient (PePG) algorithm designed to account for performativity, analyzed under softmax parametrization with/without entropy regularization.

Result: PePG converges to performatively optimal policies (optimal under self-induced distribution shifts), unlike prior works that only achieve performative stability. Empirical analysis shows PePG outperforms standard policy gradient and existing performative RL algorithms.

Conclusion: PePG significantly advances performative RL by achieving performative optimality rather than just stability, providing the first policy gradient method that properly accounts for environment shifts caused by deployed algorithms.

Abstract: Post-deployment machine learning algorithms often influence the environments they act in, and thus shift the underlying dynamics that the standard reinforcement learning (RL) methods ignore. While designing optimal algorithms in this performative setting has recently been studied in supervised learning, the RL counterpart remains under-explored. In this paper, we prove the performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and the policy gradient theorem in RL, and further introduce the Performative Policy Gradient algorithm (PePG). PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms standard policy gradient algorithms and the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "internal RL" - a method for hierarchical reinforcement learning within autoregressive models by discovering and reinforcing temporally-abstract actions in the model's internal representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL finetuning of autoregressive models explores token-by-token, which is inefficient for sparse rewards. The paper aims to enable more efficient exploration by discovering higher-level actions within the model's internal representations.

Method: Introduces a higher-order, non-causal sequence model that outputs controllers which manipulate the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. These controllers execute sequences of meaningful actions with learned termination conditions, enabling temporally-abstract exploration.

Result: On grid world and MuJoCo tasks with hierarchical structure, the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequences into internal controllers. These controllers enable efficient exploration and learning from sparse rewards where standard RL fails.

Conclusion: Internal RL demonstrates benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, offering a promising approach for hierarchical RL within foundation models by enabling temporally-abstract exploration and learning from sparse rewards.

Abstract: Large-scale autoregressive models pretrained on next-token prediction and finetuned with reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved unprecedented success on many problem domains. During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term "internal RL", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models.

### [200] [BRIDGE: Budget-aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation with Guided Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20403)
*Xuan-An Le,Minh-Nam Tran,Son Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRIDGE is a two-phase knowledge distillation framework that uses a mid-sized Teacher Assistant to bridge the capacity gap between large proprietary models and tiny deployable models, achieving better performance with far fewer expensive teacher queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct knowledge distillation from large proprietary models (like GPT-4) to tiny models (<1B parameters) faces two critical problems: 1) a huge 1000x capacity gap prevents effective transfer, and 2) API costs prohibit extensive data collection from the expensive teacher model.

Method: Two-phase framework: Phase 1 - Train a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA, ~7B) on a small subset (3-5%) of data selected via zero-API-cost pipeline balancing difficulty and diversity. Phase 2 - Use TA to generate synthetic rationales for full dataset to train tiny student, with instruction-tuning curriculum for behavioral alignment before reasoning transfer.

Result: 28-41% performance gains for tiny students across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks, closing capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries. Surpasses direct distillation baselines using 100% of budget while consuming only 5% of resources.

Conclusion: BRIDGE effectively solves the capacity-budget trap in knowledge distillation through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry, enabling efficient transfer from large proprietary models to tiny deployable models while defying conventional cost-performance tradeoffs.

Abstract: Distilling knowledge from large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4) to tiny deployable models (less than 1B parameters) faces a critical capacity-budget trap: the 1000x capacity gap between teachers and students prevents effective direct transfer, while API costs prohibit extensive data collection. We introduce BRIDGE (Budget-Aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation), a two-phase framework that resolves these constraints through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry. In Phase 1, a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA; e.g., about 7B) learns from the black-box teacher on a strictly limited subset of data (e.g., 3-5%), selected via a zero-API-cost pipeline that balances entropic difficulty and semantic diversity using only local TA inference. In Phase 2, we exploit this asymmetry-teacher queries are expensive, whereas TA inference is free to amplify supervision: the refined TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student. Crucially, we apply an instruction-tuning curriculum to establish behavioral alignment in the tiny student before transferring reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRIDGE yields tighter generalization bounds than direct distillation when data is abundant. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements: BRIDGE delivers student performance gains of 28-41%, closing the capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries. Notably, BRIDGE defies the conventional cost-performance frontier, surpassing direct distillation baselines that use 100% of the budget while consuming only 5% of the resources.

*Jibin Joseph*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using clickstream data from an e-commerce site, this research predicts frustrated user sessions with 91% accuracy using LSTM models, achieving reliable prediction within the first 20-30 interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User frustration in mobile apps and websites leads to lost sales and complaints, making it critical for businesses to identify and address frustrating user experiences to improve customer satisfaction and retention.

Method: Defined frustration using rules based on rage bursts, U-turns, cart churn, search struggle, and long wandering sessions. Applied these rules to 5.4 million clickstream events (304,881 sessions). Built tabular features for standard classifiers and used full event sequences for LSTM models.

Result: XGBoost achieved ~90% accuracy with ROC AUC of 0.9579, while LSTM performed best with ~91% accuracy and ROC AUC of 0.9705. The LSTM could reliably predict frustration using only the first 20-30 interactions.

Conclusion: LSTM models effectively predict user frustration from clickstream data, enabling early detection within initial interactions, which can help businesses proactively address user experience issues and reduce lost sales.

Abstract: Many businesses depend on their mobile apps and websites, so user frustration while trying to complete a task on these channels can cause lost sales and complaints. In this research, I use clickstream data from a real e-commerce site to predict whether a session is frustrated or not. Frustration is defined using certain rules based on rage bursts, back and forth navigation (U turns), cart churn, search struggle, and long wandering sessions, and applies these rules to 5.4 million raw clickstream events (304,881 sessions). From each session, I build tabular features and train standard classifier models. I also use the full event sequence to train a discriminative LSTM classifier. XGBoost reaches about 90% accuracy, ROC AUC of 0.9579, while the LSTM performs best with about 91% accuracy and a ROC AUC of 0.9705. Finally, the research shows that with only the first 20 to 30 interactions, the LSTM already predicts frustration reliably.

*Matthias Hertel,Sebastian Pütz,Ralf Mikut,Veit Hagenmeyer,Benjamin Schäfer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHAPformer: A fast, sampling-free explainable time-series forecasting model based on Transformers that generates SHAP-like explanations without feature independence assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series forecasts need explainability for user trust and transparency requirements. Existing SHAP methods lack efficient time-series implementations and make problematic feature independence assumptions when sampling counterfactuals.

Method: SHAPformer uses Transformer architecture with attention manipulation to make predictions based on feature subsets, enabling sampling-free SHAP-like explanations. It leverages the attention mechanism to compute contributions without the need for permutation sampling.

Result: SHAPformer generates explanations in under one second (orders of magnitude faster than SHAP Permutation Explainer). On synthetic data, it provides accurate ground truth explanations. On real-world electrical load data, it achieves competitive predictive performance and delivers meaningful insights (identifying past load as key predictor, revealing distinct Christmas period behavior).

Conclusion: SHAPformer offers an accurate, fast, and sampling-free approach for explainable time-series forecasting that overcomes limitations of traditional SHAP implementations while maintaining competitive predictive performance and providing meaningful local and global insights.

Abstract: Time-series forecasts are essential for planning and decision-making in many domains. Explainability is key to building user trust and meeting transparency requirements. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is a popular explainable AI framework, but it lacks efficient implementations for time series and often assumes feature independence when sampling counterfactuals. We introduce SHAPformer, an accurate, fast and sampling-free explainable time-series forecasting model based on the Transformer architecture. It leverages attention manipulation to make predictions based on feature subsets. SHAPformer generates explanations in under one second, several orders of magnitude faster than the SHAP Permutation Explainer. On synthetic data with ground truth explanations, SHAPformer provides explanations that are true to the data. Applied to real-world electrical load data, it achieves competitive predictive performance and delivers meaningful local and global insights, such as identifying the past load as the key predictor and revealing a distinct model behavior during the Christmas period.

*Leslie Barrett,Michael W. Sherman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes statistical methods to evaluate and enhance hand-tagged training data quality by measuring tagging consistency and agreement across multiple iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand-tagged training data is crucial for machine learning but quality varies considerably, yet quality control has received little attention in literature despite its importance.

Method: Uses statistical approaches to measure tagging consistency and agreement, analyzing multiple iterations of tagging where declining variance indicates increasing data quality. Also proposes a method to collect high-quality data without requiring multiple tags per item.

Result: Agreement metrics give more reliable results over multiple tagging iterations, declining variance indicates better quality, and a tagger burn-in period alone may not be sufficient to minimize errors.

Conclusion: Statistical evaluation of tagging consistency across multiple iterations is essential for ensuring high-quality hand-tagged training data, and simple approaches like burn-in periods may be inadequate for quality control.

Abstract: Hand-tagged training data is essential to many machine learning tasks. However, training data quality control has received little attention in the literature, despite data quality varying considerably with the tagging exercise. We propose methods to evaluate and enhance the quality of hand-tagged training data using statistical approaches to measure tagging consistency and agreement. We show that agreement metrics give more reliable results if recorded over multiple iterations of tagging, where declining variance in such recordings is an indicator of increasing data quality. We also show one way a tagging project can collect high-quality training data without requiring multiple tags for every work item, and that a tagger burn-in period may not be sufficient for minimizing tagger errors.

### [205] [Relu and softplus neural nets as zero-sum turn-based games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20582)
*Stephane Gaubert,Yiannis Vlassopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLU neural networks can be interpreted as zero-sum turn-based stopping games, where network evaluation corresponds to Shapley-Bellman backward recursion, enabling game-theoretic analysis and training as inverse game problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a novel game-theoretic interpretation of ReLU neural networks that enables new analysis techniques, robustness verification methods, and alternative training approaches through inverse game theory.

Method: Represent ReLU network outputs as values of zero-sum turn-based stopping games (ReLU net games), where network evaluation corresponds to Shapley-Bellman backward recursion. Derive discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formulas and extend to Softplus networks via entropic regularization.

Result: Established equivalence between ReLU network evaluation and game value computation, enabling: 1) output bounds from input bounds via monotonicity, 2) robustness verification using policies as certificates, 3) training reformulated as inverse game problems, and 4) extension to Softplus networks.

Conclusion: The game-theoretic framework provides powerful new tools for analyzing, verifying, and training neural networks, connecting deep learning with game theory and optimal control, with potential applications in robustness certification and interpretability.

Abstract: We show that the output of a ReLU neural network can be interpreted as the value of a zero-sum, turn-based, stopping game, which we call the ReLU net game. The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them. Finally, we show that a similar approach applies to neural networks with Softplus activation functions, where the ReLU net game is replaced by its entropic regularization.

*Yedi Zhang,Andrew Saxe,Peter E. Latham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified theoretical framework explaining how neural networks learn increasingly complex solutions through saddle-to-saddle dynamics across various architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread observation of simplicity bias (neural networks learning progressively more complex solutions), existing theoretical treatments lack a unifying framework that explains this phenomenon across different neural network architectures.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework analyzing saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for general neural networks (fully-connected, convolutional, attention-based). Analyzed fixed points, invariant manifolds, and gradient descent dynamics to show how networks iteratively evolve near invariant manifolds, approach saddles, and switch to new manifolds.

Result: Showed that linear networks learn increasing rank solutions, ReLU networks learn solutions with increasing kinks, convolutional networks learn with increasing kernels, and self-attention models learn with increasing attention heads. Also illuminated how data distribution and weight initialization affect plateau duration and number.

Conclusion: Provides a unified framework for understanding when and why gradient descent progressively learns increasingly complex solutions across diverse neural network architectures, dissociating previously confounding factors in learning dynamics.

Abstract: Neural networks trained with gradient descent often learn solutions of increasing complexity over time, a phenomenon known as simplicity bias. Despite being widely observed across architectures, existing theoretical treatments lack a unifying framework. We present a theoretical framework that explains a simplicity bias arising from saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for a general class of neural networks, incorporating fully-connected, convolutional, and attention-based architectures. Here, simple means expressible with few hidden units, i.e., hidden neurons, convolutional kernels, or attention heads. Specifically, we show that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with an increasing number of kinks, convolutional networks learn solutions with an increasing number of convolutional kernels, and self-attention models learn solutions with an increasing number of attention heads. By analyzing fixed points, invariant manifolds, and dynamics of gradient descent learning, we show that saddle-to-saddle dynamics operates by iteratively evolving near an invariant manifold, approaching a saddle, and switching to another invariant manifold. Our analysis also illuminates the effects of data distribution and weight initialization on the duration and number of plateaus in learning, dissociating previously confounding factors. Overall, our theory offers a framework for understanding when and why gradient descent progressively learns increasingly complex solutions.
