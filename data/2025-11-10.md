### [1] [IndicVisionBench: Benchmarking Cultural and Multilingual Understanding in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04727)
*Ali Faraz,Akash,Shaharukh Khan,Raja Kolla,Akshat Patidar,Suranjan Goswami,Abhinav Ravi,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndicVisionBench is the first large-scale multimodal benchmark focused on the Indian subcontinent, evaluating VLMs across 10 Indian languages and 13 cultural topics through OCR, MMT, and VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most VLM evaluation benchmarks are Western-centric, leaving gaps in understanding model performance in culturally diverse and multilingual settings, particularly for regions like the Indian subcontinent.

Method: Created a benchmark with ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across 3 multimodal tasks (OCR, MMT, VQA) covering 10 Indian languages and 13 culturally grounded topics, plus a parallel corpus for bias analysis.

Result: Evaluation of 8 VLMs revealed substantial performance gaps, highlighting limitations of current models in culturally diverse contexts.

Conclusion: IndicVisionBench establishes a reproducible framework for more inclusive multimodal research by centering cultural diversity and multilinguality.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric,
leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and
multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the
first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering
English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks,
including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation
(MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types.
Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across
13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus
of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for
analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum
of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and
large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps,
underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By
centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes
a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive
multimodal research.

### [2] [Knowledge-based anomaly detection for identifying network-induced shape artifacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04729)
*Rucha Deshpande,Tahsin Rahman,Miguel Lago,Adarsh Subbaswamy,Jana G. Delfino,Ghada Zamzmi,Elim Thompson,Aldo Badano,Seyed Kahaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel knowledge-based anomaly detection method for identifying network-induced shape artifacts in synthetic medical images, using angle gradient analysis and isolation forests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data helps address data scarcity but may introduce artifacts that compromise model performance and clinical utility, requiring quality assessment methods.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) feature extractor analyzing per-image distribution of angle gradients along anatomical boundaries, (2) isolation forest-based anomaly detector.

Result: Achieved AUC values of 0.97 and 0.91 on two mammography datasets, with human reader agreement rates of 66% and 68% for most anomalous images, and Kendall-Tau correlations of 0.45 and 0.43.

Conclusion: The method enables responsible use of synthetic data by allowing developers to evaluate synthetic images for anatomical constraints and improve dataset quality.

Abstract: Synthetic data provides a promising approach to address data scarcity for
training machine learning models; however, adoption without proper quality
assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that
compromise model performance and clinical utility. This work introduces a novel
knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape
artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage
framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a
specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle
gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based
anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for
identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography
datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets
respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully
concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with
AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study
involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the
method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human
readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the
most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least
anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human
rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable
agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This
method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows
developers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and
pinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a
synthetic dataset.

### [3] [CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04753)
*Zonglin Lyu,Ming Li,Xinxin Liu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ControlNet++ improves text-to-image controllability but has limitations in optimization. The paper proposes Condition Preference Optimization (CPO), which performs preference learning over control conditions rather than images, achieving better controllability with lower variance and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ControlNet++ optimize only low-noise timesteps and introduce approximation errors, while DPO suffers from confounding factors in image quality when selecting win-lose pairs. There's a need for a more effective approach to improve controllability across all timesteps.

Method: Proposes Condition Preference Optimization (CPO) that constructs winning and losing control signals (c^w and c^l) and trains the model to prefer c^w, eliminating confounding factors from image quality variations.

Result: CPO significantly improves controllability over ControlNet++: over 10% error rate reduction in segmentation, 70-80% in human pose, and consistent 2-5% reductions in edge and depth maps. It also has lower contrastive loss variance than DPO.

Conclusion: CPO provides a more effective and efficient approach for improving controllability in text-to-image generation by focusing on control conditions rather than generated images, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces
image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle
consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the
prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++
optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step
approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps
but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward
alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model
preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones
($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to
ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping
other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose
performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated
images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference
Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance
training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss
variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO
requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive
experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the
state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error
rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent
$2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

### [4] [DARN: Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks for Efficient and Robust Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04766)
*Dhenenjay Yadav,Rohan Sawai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARN is a novel decoder architecture that dynamically adapts regularization for geospatial foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both full fine-tuning and efficient adaptation paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard adaptation methods for foundation models in geospatial analysis use fixed regularization strategies that fail to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: DARN integrates three innovations: Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) for per-sample difficulty estimation, Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM) that dynamically adjusts dropout rates (0.1-0.5), and Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) for channel activation modulation.

Result: DARN achieves new SOTA on GeoBench (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp) in full fine-tuning and SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU) in efficient adaptation, with superior OOD generalization (+9.5 pp), enhanced robustness (17% error reduction), and improved minority class performance.

Conclusion: DARN provides a more intelligent, robust, and efficient approach to leveraging foundation models in critical geospatial applications by dynamically adapting regularization to handle satellite imagery heterogeneity.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) offer powerful representations for geospatial
analysis, but adapting them effectively remains challenging. Standard
adaptation methods, whether full fine-tuning or efficient frozen-backbone
approaches, typically employ decoders with fixed regularization strategies,
failing to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery. We
introduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder
architecture designed to address this limitation. DARN integrates three key
innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates
per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically
adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and
(3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation. We provide
theoretical justifications linking DARN's optimization to stationary point
convergence and its mechanism to adaptive information bottlenecks. Empirically,
DARN demonstrates exceptional performance across both major adaptation
paradigms. In full fine-tuning (unfrozen backbone), DARN achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the multi-task GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp
over prior SOTA). In efficient adaptation (frozen backbone), DARN achieves
SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) while delivering
substantial advantages crucial for real-world deployment: superior
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU on AI4SmallFarms),
enhanced robustness (17% relative reduction in corruption error), and improved
performance on minority classes. DARN offers a more intelligent, robust, and
efficient approach to leveraging FMs in critical geospatial applications.

### [5] [Global 3D Reconstruction of Clouds & Tropical Cyclones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04773)
*Shirin Ermis,Cesar Aybar,Lilli Freischem,Stella Girtsou,Kyriaki-Margarita Bintsi,Emiliano Diaz Salas-Porras,Michael Eisinger,William Jones,Anna Jungbluth,Benoit Tremblay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework using pre-training and fine-tuning to convert 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps for tropical cyclones, enabling global 3D cloud reconstruction even when observations are missing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate tropical cyclone forecasting is challenging due to limited satellite observations of TC structure and difficulties in resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification.

Method: Pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline that learns from multiple satellites with global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of relevant cloud properties, applied to a custom-built TC dataset.

Result: First-time creation of global instantaneous 3D cloud maps and accurate reconstruction of 3D structure of intense storms, extending available satellite observations and providing estimates when observations are missing.

Conclusion: This framework is crucial for advancing understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts by providing comprehensive 3D cloud structure information.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to
limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in
resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has
demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud
reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have
been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for
intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a
pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with
global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of
relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to
evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show
that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps
and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not
only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when
observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our
understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

*Andrea Aspesi,Andrea Simpsi,Aaron Tognoli,Simone Mentasti,Luca Merigo,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EETnet is a CNN for event-based eye tracking that runs on microcontrollers, with classification and regression versions for pupil detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based eye tracking solutions are limited to powerful GPUs and lack deployment on embedded devices with limited resources.

Method: Developed EETnet CNN for event-based eye tracking, with training/evaluation/quantization methodology using public dataset, offering classification (grid-based) and regression (pixel-level) models.

Result: Created a neural network capable of running on microcontrollers for event-based eye tracking, addressing the resource constraints of embedded devices.

Conclusion: EETnet enables efficient, low-power eye tracking on embedded devices using purely event-based data, overcoming limitations of GPU-dependent solutions.

Abstract: Event-based cameras are becoming a popular solution for efficient, low-power
eye tracking. Due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of event data, they
require less processing power and offer latencies in the microsecond range.
However, many existing solutions are limited to validation on powerful GPUs,
with no deployment on real embedded devices. In this paper, we present EETnet,
a convolutional neural network designed for eye tracking using purely
event-based data, capable of running on microcontrollers with limited
resources. Additionally, we outline a methodology to train, evaluate, and
quantize the network using a public dataset. Finally, we propose two versions
of the architecture: a classification model that detects the pupil on a grid
superimposed on the original image, and a regression model that operates at the
pixel level.

### [7] [3D Gaussian Point Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04797)
*Jim James,Ben Wilson,Simon Lucey,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Point Encoder is an explicit geometric representation using learned 3D Gaussians for 3D recognition, offering faster and more efficient performance than traditional PointNets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move from implicit representations like PointNet to explicit geometric representations for 3D recognition tasks, similar to the shift from NeRF to Gaussian Splatting in 3D reconstruction.

Method: Developed optimization techniques using natural gradients and distillation from PointNets to learn Gaussian Basis that reconstructs PointNet activations, and extended filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Result: Achieved 2.7x faster speed than comparable PointNet with 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. In Mamba3D, achieved 1.27x faster speed with 42% memory reduction and 54% FLOPs reduction.

Conclusion: 3D Gaussian Point Encoders provide efficient explicit geometric representations that are lightweight enough for high framerates on CPU-only devices, outperforming traditional PointNets in speed and efficiency.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component
in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and
FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight
enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

*Tiziano Natali,Karin A. Olthof,Niels F. M. Kok,Koert F. D. Kuhlmann,Theo J. M. Ruers,Matteo Fusaglia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automatic 3D segmentation of colorectal liver metastases in intraoperative ultrasound using a cropped 3D U-Net achieves expert-level accuracy with near real-time performance, enabling efficient ultrasound-based navigation for liver surgery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate delineation of colorectal liver metastases during surgery is challenging with conventional intraoperative ultrasound due to low contrast, noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision and efficiency in surgical navigation workflows.

Method: Used 85 tracked 3D intraoperative ultrasound volumes from CRLM patients to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net via nnU-Net framework. Compared two variants: full-volume training vs cropped regions around tumors. Integrated workflow into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.

Result: Cropped-volume model significantly outperformed full-volume model (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718), achieving median DSC = 0.74, recall = 0.79, and Hausdorff Distance = 17.1 mm. Comparable to semi-automatic segmentation but ~4x faster execution (~1 min). Prospective testing confirmed robust performance for real-time surgical guidance.

Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in intraoperative ultrasound using cropped 3D U-Net provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input, enabling efficient registration-free ultrasound-based navigation while substantially reducing manual workload and procedure time.

Abstract: Introduction: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver
metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but
remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast,
noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision
and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.
  Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used
to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two
variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped
regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference
(RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated
into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.
  Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume
model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC =
0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic
segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective
intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with
clinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.
  Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net
provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The
method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for
hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing
manual workload and procedure time.

### [9] [Data Efficiency and Transfer Robustness in Biomedical Image Segmentation: A Study of Redundancy and Forgetting with Cellpose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04803)
*Shuo Zhao,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes data redundancy and catastrophic forgetting in biomedical image segmentation using Cellpose, showing that only 10% of training data is needed for performance saturation, and proposes dataset quantization and selective replay strategies to address these challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two underexplored challenges in generalist biomedical image segmentation models: (1) training data redundancy and (2) the impact of cross-domain transfer on model retention and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Used Cellpose as a case study with systematic empirical analysis. Proposed dataset quantization (DQ) for compact training subsets, conducted cross-domain fine-tuning experiments, and implemented selective DQ-based replay strategies with domain sequencing.

Result: Found that image segmentation performance saturates with only 10% of data, revealing substantial redundancy. Cross-domain fine-tuning showed significant source domain degradation, but selective replay with 5-10% source data effectively restored performance. Domain sequencing improved generalization and reduced forgetting.

Conclusion: Efficient biomedical image segmentation requires data-centric design including compact training subsets, retention-aware learning strategies, and informed domain ordering to address redundancy and catastrophic forgetting challenges.

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are
increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However,
two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data
redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In
this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges
using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a
simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse
training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation
performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial
redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space
analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches
capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine
catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and
observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when
adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective
DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively
restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.
Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization
and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the
importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest
that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention
aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering. The code is available
at https://github.com/MMV-Lab/biomedseg-efficiency.

### [10] [An Active Learning Pipeline for Biomedical Image Instance Segmentation with Minimal Human Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04811)
*Shuo Zhao,Yu Zhou,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-centric AI workflow that combines foundation models and nnU-Net with active learning and pseudo-labeling to reduce manual annotation requirements for biomedical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of traditional methods (noise sensitivity), nnU-Net (requires extensive annotated data), and foundation models (underperformance on specific datasets) in biomedical image segmentation.

Method: Proposes a pipeline that: 1) generates pseudo-labels from foundation models, 2) uses them for nnU-Net self-configuration, 3) selects representative core-set for minimal manual annotation, and 4) fine-tunes nnU-Net.

Result: Significantly reduces the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance in biomedical image segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Provides an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply state-of-the-art AI techniques with minimal human intervention, bridging the gap between traditional neural networks and large foundation models.

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation
and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data,
while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in
segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making
it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a
substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge
when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer
zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with
unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work
addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that
leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of
traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human
intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation
model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a
representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling
effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces
the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,
providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply
state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks. The code is

### [11] [Geometry Denoising with Preferred Normal Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04848)
*Manuel Weiß,Lukas Baumgärtner,Roland Herzog,Stephan Schmidt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel geometry denoising method that uses prior knowledge about surface normal vectors through label vectors, incorporating segmentation and regularization via total variation, solved with split Bregman (ADMM) approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve geometry denoising by leveraging prior knowledge about surface normal vectors, which allows for more accurate and structured denoising through segmentation.

Method: Uses a set of preferred normal vectors (label vectors) for segmentation based on normal similarity, with regularization via total variation term. Employs split Bregman (ADMM) optimization with vertex updates based on second-order shape calculus.

Result: The method enables simultaneous geometry denoising and segmentation by incorporating normal vector priors and regularization.

Conclusion: This approach provides an effective framework for geometry denoising that integrates segmentation and regularization through normal vector priors, solved efficiently using ADMM optimization.

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge
about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a
set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A
segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The
segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of
the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term.
We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting
optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape
calculus.

### [12] [Self-Supervised Implicit Attention Priors for Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04864)
*Kyle Fogarty,Chenyue Cai,Jing Yang,Zhilin Guo,Cengiz Öztireli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An implicit self-prior approach that learns shape-specific priors directly from input point clouds using cross-attention with a learnable dictionary, enabling high-quality surface reconstruction without external training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point clouds is ill-posed without strong geometric priors, and existing methods often require external training data or struggle with sparse regions.

Method: Jointly trains a dictionary of learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field using cross-attention, then samples the trained field to extract dense points and normals, integrating them into robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS).

Result: Outperforms both classical and learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

Conclusion: The hybrid strategy effectively preserves fine geometric details while leveraging learned self-priors to regularize sparse regions, achieving state-of-the-art surface reconstruction without external training data.

Abstract: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed
unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit
self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the
input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural
representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of
learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location,
the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network
to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent
to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction
losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively
integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field
is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via
automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and
corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS)
formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in
the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse
regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and
learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior
detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

### [13] [Clinical-ComBAT: a diffusion-weighted MRI harmonization method for clinical applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04871)
*Gabriel Girard,Manon Edde,Félix Dumais,Yoan David,Matthieu Dumont,Guillaume Theaud,Jean-Christophe Houde,Arnaud Boré,Maxime Descoteaux,Pierre-Marc Jodoin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Clinical-ComBAT is a flexible harmonization method for diffusion-weighted MRI data that addresses limitations of traditional ComBAT by enabling independent site harmonization, non-linear modeling, and adaptation to small cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DW-MRI harmonization methods like ComBAT have limitations for clinical use due to linear covariate assumptions, fixed site requirements, and poor performance with small cohorts, restricting multi-site data integration.

Method: Clinical-ComBAT uses independent site harmonization with non-linear polynomial modeling, site-specific reference to normative data, variance priors for small cohorts, hyperparameter tuning, and goodness-of-fit assessment.

Result: The method shows improved alignment of diffusion metrics in both simulated and real data, demonstrating enhanced applicability for normative modeling compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Clinical-ComBAT provides a practical solution for real-world clinical DW-MRI harmonization, overcoming key limitations of existing methods and enabling flexible multi-site data integration.

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new

### [14] [Validating Vision Transformers for Otoscopy: Performance and Data-Leakage Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04872)
*James Ndubuisi,Fernando Auat,Marta Vallejo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision transformers (Swin v1/v2) initially showed superior accuracy (100%/99.1%) for ear disease diagnosis compared to ResNet (99.5%), but after fixing data leakage in preprocessing, performance dropped significantly to 83% for Swin models and 82% for ResNet, highlighting the critical importance of proper data handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve diagnostic accuracy for ear diseases given the reported 27% misdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, and to evaluate whether vision transformers can outperform traditional CNNs in medical imaging tasks.

Method: Used real-world otoscopic video dataset from a clinical hospital, selected frames using Laplacian and Shannon entropy thresholds, removed blank frames, and compared Swin v1, Swin v2 transformer models against ResNet CNN model.

Result: Initial results showed excellent performance (100% Swin v1, 99.1% Swin v2, 99.5% ResNet), but after discovering and mitigating data leakage in preprocessing, corrected accuracies dropped to 83% for both Swin models and 82% for ResNet.

Conclusion: Vision transformers show promise but proper data preprocessing is equally crucial. Finding the optimal balance between advanced model architectures and rigorous data handling is key to developing reliable medical diagnostic models.

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of vision transformer models, specifically
Swin transformers, in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of ear diseases
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. With a reported 27%
misdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, improving diagnostic
accuracy is crucial. The research utilised a real-world dataset from the
Department of Otolaryngology at the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de
Chile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle
and external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and
Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and
Swin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively,
marginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed
metrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a
critical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this
study and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the
data leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies
were 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This
finding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning
studies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while
vision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance
between the benefits of advanced model architectures and those derived from
effective data preprocessing. This balance is key to developing a reliable
machine learning model for diagnosing ear diseases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geospatial deep learning framework using satellite imagery to predict fatal crash risks with uncertainty-aware Beta probability distributions, achieving 17-23% recall improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional traffic safety studies that examine risk factors in isolation and conventional neural networks that provide point estimates without uncertainty, which is critical for safety-critical decision-making.

Method: Novel geospatial deep learning framework leveraging satellite imagery as comprehensive spatial input to capture nuanced spatial patterns and environmental risk factors, estimating full Beta probability distributions over fatal crash risk.

Result: Outperforms baselines with 17-23% improvement in recall (key metric for flagging potential dangers) while delivering superior calibration, providing reliable and interpretable risk assessments from satellite imagery alone.

Conclusion: Enables safer autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively through uncertainty-aware, trustworthy AI predictions.

Abstract: Roadway traffic accidents represent a global health crisis, responsible for
over a million deaths annually and costing many countries up to 3% of their
GDP. Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in
isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions
inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural
Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without
conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical
decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial
deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive
spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial
patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash
risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates
a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate
and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in
safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a
17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers,
while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable
risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer
autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and
policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.

*Hu Gao,Xiaoning Lei,Ying Zhang,Xichen Xu,Guannan Jiang,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes IMDNet, an adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that uses decoupled degradation representations to dynamically select optimal restoration paths for handling multiple coexisting degradations like rain, noise, and haze.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing image restoration methods focus on single degradation types, while real-world images often suffer from multiple coexisting degradations, limiting practical effectiveness.

Method: Uses degradation ingredient decoupling blocks (DIDBlock) to separate degradation ingredients statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information, fusion blocks (FBlock) to integrate degradation information across levels, and task adaptation blocks (TABlock) to dynamically activate/fuse functional branches based on multi-degradation representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Conclusion: IMDNet provides an effective tightly integrated architecture for handling multiple coexisting degradations in real-world images through adaptive path selection guided by decoupled degradation representations.

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded
observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a
single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple
coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single
image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an
adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images
by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide
path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling
block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients
statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information,
enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their
feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block
(FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable
matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block
(TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the
multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths
under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated
architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments,
showing superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining
strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the
availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of
clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal
dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over
eight years (2018-2025), with patients ranging from 10 to 90 years of age. The
dataset includes 50000 intraoral images, 8056 radiographs, and detailed textual

classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete
diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models
with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved
substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring
its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The
dataset is publicly available, providing an essential resource for future

*Tharindu Fernando,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep learning framework using high-dimensional latent space representations and Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (MAARL) for robust and adaptive deepfake watermarking that balances robustness against benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing passive deepfake detectors that struggle to generalize to new deepfake types, and improve proactive deepfake detection using watermarks that often fail to balance robustness against benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering.

Method: Develop a learnable watermark embedder operating in latent space to capture high-level image semantics, combined with MAARL paradigm where a watermarking agent interacts with adversarial attacker agent simulating benign and malicious image manipulations to achieve optimal balance between robustness and fragility.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ benchmarks under challenging manipulation scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the challenge of balancing robustness and fragility in deepfake watermarking, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating effectiveness in identifying high-quality synthetic media.

Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under
challenging manipulation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLM enables 3D Gaussian Splatting to render large scenes on consumer GPUs by offloading Gaussians to CPU memory and using pipelining to overlap communication and computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting has high memory requirements that exceed GPU capacity for large scenes, limiting its practical use on consumer hardware.

Method: Uses CPU memory offloading with pipelining strategy to overlap GPU-CPU communication, GPU computation, and CPU computation, plus communication volume reduction techniques.

Result: Can render scenes with 100 million Gaussians on a single RTX4090 GPU while maintaining state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: CLM successfully enables large-scale 3DGS rendering on consumer-grade GPUs through efficient memory management and pipelining techniques.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDS is a novel method for cross-modality MRI synthesis that addresses fMRI-dMRI completion using a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D diffusion framework and tissue refinement network, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both synthesis quality and clinical diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing modalities in MRI (especially fMRI and dMRI) are a major barrier for clinical use in neurodegenerative disease studies. Existing GAN and diffusion models struggle with fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to significant signal differences and inadequate integration of disease-related neuroanatomical patterns.

Method: Proposes PDS with two key innovations: (1) pattern-aware dual-modal 3D diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) tissue refinement network with efficient microstructure refinement to maintain structural fidelity and fine details.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house datasets: PSNR/SSIM of 29.83 dB/90.84% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12% over baselines) and 30.00 dB/77.55% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2%). Clinical validation shows 67.92%/66.02%/64.15% accuracy for NC vs. MCI vs. AD classification.

Conclusion: PDS effectively addresses the challenges of fMRI-dMRI synthesis and demonstrates strong diagnostic performance, making synthesized data clinically useful for neurodegenerative disease studies.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and
diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases.
However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use.
Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in
modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1)
significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and
dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related
neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we
propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D
diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement
network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain
structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house
datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores
of 29.83 dB/90.84\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\% over baselines) and
30.00 dB/77.55\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\%). In clinical validation,
the synthesized data show strong diagnostic performance, achieving
67.92\%/66.02\%/64.15\% accuracy (NC vs. MCI vs. AD) in hybrid real-synthetic
experiments. Code is available in \href{https://github.com/SXR3015/PDS}{PDS

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to probe DNNs' geometric understanding by using optimized shapes as semantic carriers, interpretability tools, and adversarial examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks have focused more on texture than shape, leaving their geometric understanding poorly explored. This work aims to systematically investigate how DNNs perceive and process geometric information.

Method: An end-to-end differentiable framework that combines Fourier series parameterization of shapes, winding number-based pixel grid mapping, and signal energy constraints for optimization efficiency and physical plausibility.

Result: Optimized shapes can generate high-confidence classifications, serve as precise interpretability tools for identifying salient regions, and create generalizable adversarial examples that deceive downstream visual tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides a versatile framework for exploring DNNs' geometric perception and opens new frontiers for challenging and understanding machine vision systems.

Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research
on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving
their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that
optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating
high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry;
second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely
isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new,
generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual
tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that
unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding
number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs,
and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while
ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework
for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging
and understanding machine perception.

TL;DR: A novel method for generating labeled 3D datasets with controlled topological invariants using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, enabling training of neural network-based topological data analysis estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TDA methods like persistent homology are computationally demanding, and there's a lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity for supervised learning in TDA tasks.

Method: Systematic generation of labeled 3D datasets using Repulsive Surface algorithm with control over topological invariants (e.g., hole count), and training a genus estimator network using 3D convolutional transformer architecture.

Result: Created a varied geometry dataset with topological labeling suitable for training neural network estimators; observed decreased accuracy as deformations increase, highlighting the role of both topological and geometric complexity.

Conclusion: The dataset fills a gap in labeled 3D datasets for training and evaluating TDA models, demonstrating that geometric complexity alongside topological complexity affects estimator generalization.

Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the
underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods
like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the
development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing
computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these
methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity
tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets
using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological
invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry
with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking
neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a
genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer
architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase
highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric
complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in
labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and
techniques for TDA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLM architectures have an inherent bias toward language modality because visual embeddings are typically just appended to input text sequences, leading to poor visual grounding and increased hallucinations.

Method: Propose refining textual embeddings by integrating average-pooled visual features, providing a simple yet effective approach to incorporate visual information into text representations.

Result: The method demonstrably improves visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of visual-informed text embedding refinement.

Conclusion: While average pooling offers a straightforward and efficient solution, more sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and cross-modal alignment, but this is left for future work as the primary focus was highlighting modality imbalance and its impact.

Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures
toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of
simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this,
we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by
integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves
visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established

efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more
sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and
cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to
highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to
show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this
issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address GPU limitations in processing gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) containing tens of thousands of tiles, making end-to-end training difficult due to gradient computation constraints.

Method: Uses memory bank to store tile features across dataset, samples subset of tiles per WSI, combines with features from memory bank using residual encoding, and applies slide-level contrastive learning with histopathology reports.

Result: Experiments on cancer subtyping, cancer recognition, and mutation prediction tasks demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed DRE-SLCL method.

Conclusion: DRE-SLCL successfully enables end-to-end WSI representation learning by overcoming GPU memory limitations through dynamic residual encoding and contrastive learning.

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.

TL;DR: Pressure2Motion generates human motion from ground pressure sequences and text prompts, enabling privacy-preserving motion capture without cameras or wearables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable motion capture in scenarios requiring privacy, low-light conditions, or low-cost setups by eliminating the need for cameras, specialized lighting, or wearable devices.

Method: Uses a dual-level feature extractor for pressure data interpretation and a hierarchical diffusion model that processes broad movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments, guided by both pressure cues and text prompts.

Result: Generates high-fidelity, physically plausible motions and establishes a new state-of-the-art for this task, with the MPL benchmark being the first for pressure-to-motion generation.

Conclusion: Pressure2Motion is a pioneering approach that successfully combines pressure data and linguistic priors for motion generation, offering a practical solution for privacy-preserving and cost-effective motion capture.

Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and
benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.

regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While
achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design
of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose
NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive
next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized
image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model
design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external
segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training.
It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale
multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly,
to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail
token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel
strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative
prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance
boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a
memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes
difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and
MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional
MRIS pipelines.

### [28] [No Pose Estimation? No Problem: Pose-Agnostic and Instance-Aware Test-Time Adaptation for Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05055)
*Mingyu Sung,Hyeonmin Choe,Il-Min Kim,Sangseok Yun,Jae Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PITTA is a novel test-time adaptation framework for monocular depth estimation that enables pose-agnostic adaptation without camera pose information and uses instance-aware masking for dynamic objects, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptation methods for monocular depth estimation are ineffective in diverse and dynamic environments, limiting their practical deployment in real-world scenarios with varying conditions.

Method: Proposes PITTA framework with two key strategies: (1) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm that adapts pretrained MDE networks without camera pose information, and (2) instance-aware image masking that extracts dynamic object masks using pretrained panoptic segmentation and removes static background components. Also includes edge extraction methodology for input images and depth maps.

Result: Extensive experiments on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets show PITTA surpasses state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable performance improvements in monocular depth estimation during test-time adaptation across varying environmental conditions.

Conclusion: PITTA provides an effective solution for test-time adaptation in monocular depth estimation, enabling robust performance in diverse and dynamic real-world environments without requiring camera pose information.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB
images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety
of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In
the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments
with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain)
adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address
the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE,
particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still
ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments.
To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA
framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative
strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware
image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained
MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose
information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts
instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)
from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation
network, by removing static objects including background components. To further
boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction
methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.
Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with
varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework,
PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable
performance improvements in MDE during TTA.

*Yuanxiang Huangfu,Chaochao Wang,Weilei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Role-SynthCLIP is a data synthesis framework that uses multi-perspective role-playing prompts with MLLMs to generate semantically diverse captions, improving CLIP model performance with fewer training pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic data generation methods focus on increasing data volume but result in limited semantic diversity and redundant/shallow captions, which limits CLIP model effectiveness.

Method: Uses multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., compositional analyst, interpreter of image context) to guide MLLMs in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints, enhancing semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment.

Result: CLIP-B/16 model trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves Recall@1 of 64.1% on MS COCO validation set, surpassing best existing synthetic baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points.

Conclusion: Role-SynthCLIP effectively improves caption expressiveness and accuracy while maintaining the same number of image-text pairs, demonstrating superior efficiency and performance over volume-focused synthetic data methods.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models
critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training
data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus
on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic
diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we
propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages
multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an
interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This
mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment
of synthetic pairs, thereby improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while
keeping the total number of image-text pairs unchanged. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. A CLIP-B/16 model
trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on
the MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data
baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points. The code and trained
models are released at https://github.com/huangfu170/Role-SynthCLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgiATM is a lightweight plug-and-play module for surgical smoke removal that bridges physics-based atmospheric models with deep learning, enhancing existing desmoking methods without adding trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical smoke during laparoscopic procedures degrades visual quality, increasing surgical error risks and hindering clinical decision-making and computer-assisted analysis, making smoke removal critical for patient safety and operative efficiency.

Method: SurgiATM statistically combines physics-based atmospheric models with data-driven deep learning, designed as a plug-and-play module with only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights that can integrate with various surgical desmoking architectures.

Result: Experiments on three public surgical datasets with ten desmoking methods show SurgiATM reduces restoration errors and enhances generalizability across multiple procedures without adding trainable layers or weights.

Conclusion: SurgiATM provides a convenient, low-cost, effective, and generalizable solution for surgical smoke removal that can be easily integrated into existing systems to improve accuracy and stability while meeting clinical requirements.

Abstract: During laparoscopic surgery, smoke generated by tissue cauterization can
significantly degrade the visual quality of endoscopic frames, increasing the
risk of surgical errors and hindering both clinical decision-making and
computer-assisted visual analysis. Consequently, removing surgical smoke is
critical to ensuring patient safety and maintaining operative efficiency. In
this study, we propose the Surgical Atmospheric Model (SurgiATM) for surgical
smoke removal. SurgiATM statistically bridges a physics-based atmospheric model
and data-driven deep learning models, combining the superior generalizability
of the former with the high accuracy of the latter. Furthermore, SurgiATM is
designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly
integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance their
accuracy and stability, better meeting clinical requirements. It introduces
only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving the
original network architecture with minimal computational and modification
overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets
with ten desmoking methods, involving multiple network architectures and
covering diverse procedures, including cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy,
and diaphragm dissection. The results demonstrate that incorporating SurgiATM
commonly reduces the restoration errors of existing models and relatively
enhances their generalizability, without adding any trainable layers or
weights. This highlights the convenience, low cost, effectiveness, and
generalizability of the proposed method. The code for SurgiATM is released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adversarial examples are highly sensitive to occlusion compared to clean samples. The paper introduces SMCE to measure this sensitivity and proposes SWM-AED for detection, achieving up to 96.5% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean samples for enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial attacks.

Method: Used controlled experiments on CIFAR-10 with nine canonical attacks, introduced Sliding Mask Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under occlusion, and proposed Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example Detection (SWM-AED).

Result: Adversarial examples showed significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals. SWM-AED achieved robust performance with accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to 96.5% across classifiers and attacks.

Conclusion: The sensitivity of adversarial examples to occlusion provides a reliable basis for detection, and SWM-AED offers an effective alternative to conventional adversarial training that avoids catastrophic overfitting.

Abstract: Understanding intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean
samples is key to enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial
attacks. This study first empirically finds that image-based adversarial
examples are notably sensitive to occlusion. Controlled experiments on CIFAR-10
used nine canonical attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD) to generate adversarial examples,
paired with original samples for evaluation. We introduce Sliding Mask
Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under
occlusion. Using 1800+ test images, SMCE calculations supported by Mask Entropy
Field Maps and statistical distributions show adversarial examples have
significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals.
Based on this, we propose Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example
Detection (SWM-AED), which avoids catastrophic overfitting of conventional
adversarial training. Evaluations across classifiers and attacks on CIFAR-10
demonstrate robust performance, with accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to
96.5%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DPPP, a dual-stage framework using diffusion models to generate privacy-preserving virtual data for person re-identification, achieving SOTA generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in person Re-ID by creating virtual data as alternative to sensitive real images, overcoming challenges of complex construction and poor domain generalization in existing virtual datasets.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Generate diverse virtual dataset (GenePerson) using multi-dimensional prompts with diffusion model; 2) Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) using contrastive learning and textual inversion to separate style/content features for domain-invariant learning.

Result: Created GenePerson dataset with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. Models trained with PDM achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance, surpassing training on both real and virtual Re-ID datasets.

Conclusion: DPPP framework effectively addresses privacy concerns while achieving superior generalization in person Re-ID through virtual data generation and domain-invariant feature learning.

Abstract: With growing concerns over data privacy, researchers have started using
virtual data as an alternative to sensitive real-world images for training
person re-identification (Re-ID) models. However, existing virtual datasets
produced by game engines still face challenges such as complex construction and
poor domain generalization, making them difficult to apply in real scenarios.
To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-stage Prompt-driven
Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP). In the first stage, we generate rich
prompts incorporating multi-dimensional attributes such as pedestrian
appearance, illumination, and viewpoint that drive the diffusion model to
synthesize diverse data end-to-end, building a large-scale virtual dataset
named GenePerson with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. In the second stage,
we propose a Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) to learn
domain-invariant generalization features. With the aid of contrastive learning,
we employ two textual inversion networks to map images into pseudo-words
representing style and content, respectively, thereby constructing
style-disentangled content prompts to guide the model in learning
domain-invariant content features at the image level. Experiments demonstrate
that models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art
generalization performance, surpassing those on popular real and virtual Re-ID
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, and existing vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to generalize to complex weather degradations.

Method: Constructed HFLS-Weather physics-driven dataset, then designed dual-level RL framework: local level refines weather-specific restoration models through perturbation-driven quality optimization, global level uses meta-controller to dynamically orchestrate model selection and execution order based on scene degradation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of adverse weather scenarios, enabling continuous adaptation to real-world conditions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses adverse weather visual perception challenges through physics-driven simulation and dynamic reinforcement learning, providing robust performance without requiring paired supervision.

Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study uses deep learning on raw OCT B-scan images for early Alzheimer's disease detection, achieving an AUC of 0.62 with ResNet-34, providing a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore direct classification of OCT B-scan images for early AD detection, moving beyond traditional segmented layer thickness measurements, as this represents the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans for AD prediction.

Method: Fine-tuned multiple pretrained models (ImageNet-based networks and OCT-specific RETFound transformer) using subject-level cross-validation from UK Biobank, with OCT-specific augmentation and year-weighted loss function prioritizing cases diagnosed within 4 years of imaging.

Result: ResNet-34 achieved the most stable results with AUC of 0.62 in the 4-year cohort, though below clinical application threshold. Explainability analyses confirmed localized structural differences in central macular subfield between AD and control groups.

Conclusion: The study provides a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlights challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before diagnosis, and points to need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

Abstract: Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on
segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct
classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans
for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image
classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis
because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and
evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the
OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation
datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank
cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both
standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a
year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years
of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of
0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical
application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural
differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups.
These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the
challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis,
and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lane detection in snow-covered environments is challenging due to frequent absence or occlusion of traditional lane markings, creating a major obstacle for autonomous driving in winter conditions.

Method: Detects vertical roadside posts (delineators) as indirect lane indicators, then fits smooth lane trajectories using parameterized Bezier curve models that leverage spatial consistency and road geometry. Uses a new synthetic dataset with 80,000 annotated frames of winter driving conditions.

Result: Significantly improved robustness in adverse weather compared to state-of-the-art lane detection systems, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion where traditional lane markings are not visible.

Conclusion: Establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for all-weather autonomous driving research, with the SnowyLane dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method that improves dynamic 3D reconstruction from sparse multi-view video by separating foreground and background components using sparse masks, achieving state-of-the-art results with smaller model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of current methods in handling complex dynamic features from sparse camera configurations common in filmmaking with tight budgets.

Method: Splits canonical Gaussians and deformation field into foreground/background using sparse masks at t=0, trains each separately with different loss functions, and models different parameters for each deformation field based on their dynamic characteristics.

Result: Achieves up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3D scenes, produces segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures without dense mask supervision.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables high-quality dynamic 3D reconstruction from sparse camera setups while producing segmented outputs, making it suitable for filmmaking applications with budget constraints.

Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D
reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a
canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result
in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods
when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an
approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into
foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at
t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions
during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different
parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking
practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in
color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing
film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes
in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment
datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative
results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the
SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces
segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIXEL is a knowledge distillation method that enables DINOv3 models to produce high-resolution feature maps more efficiently by having students learn to generate their own features at higher resolutions, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like DINOv3 require high-resolution inputs and large computational resources due to transformer's quadratic complexity, making them inefficient for practical applications.

Method: Proposes BRIXEL, a knowledge distillation approach where the student model learns to reproduce its own feature maps at higher resolution through self-supervised learning.

Result: BRIXEL outperforms baseline DINOv3 models on downstream tasks with fixed resolution and produces similar feature maps to the teacher at significantly reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: BRIXEL provides an effective solution to reduce computational requirements of high-resolution vision models while maintaining or improving performance through simple knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and
locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3
model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling
state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires
the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large
amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer
architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge
distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature
maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the
baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution
is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very
similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code
and model weights are available at https://github.com/alexanderlappe/BRIXEL.

TL;DR: MUSE is a self-supervised learning method for nucleus detection and classification in histopathology that uses multi-scale dense self-distillation with a novel nucleus-based local self-distillation mechanism, eliminating the need for strict spatial alignment between views and enabling cross-scale alignment for fine-grained nucleus representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing nucleus detection and classification methods rely heavily on labor-intensive nucleus-level annotations and fail to effectively leverage large-scale unlabeled data for learning discriminative nucleus representations in histopathology analysis.

Method: Proposed MUSE with NuLo (Nucleus-based Local self-distillation) - a coordinate-guided mechanism for flexible local self-distillation using predicted nucleus positions, removing strict spatial alignment requirements. Also designed an encoder-decoder architecture and large field-of-view semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show MUSE effectively addresses core challenges of histopathological NDC, surpassing state-of-the-art supervised baselines and outperforming generic pathology foundation models.

Conclusion: MUSE provides an effective self-supervised learning approach for nucleus detection and classification that leverages unlabeled data through multi-scale dense self-distillation, achieving superior performance without requiring extensive manual annotations.

Abstract: Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a
fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology
applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive
nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled
data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we
propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised
learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local
self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local
self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need
for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical
cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained
nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective
encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology
images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The
resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but
also outperform generic pathology foundation models.

Abstract: This paper presents Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a unique contour tracking
algorithm specifically adapted for detailed segmentation of infrared (IR) ships
and various objects in RGB.1 This extends the original Walk the Lines (WtL)
[12], which focused solely on detailed ship segmentation in color. These
innovative WtLs can replace the standard non-maximum suppression (NMS) by using
contour tracking to refine the object contour until a 1-pixel-wide closed shape
can be binarized, forming a segmentable area in foreground-background
scenarios. WtL2 broadens the application range of WtL beyond its original
scope, adapting to IR and expanding to diverse objects within the RGB context.
To achieve IR segmentation, we adapt its input, the object contour detector, to
IR ships. In addition, the algorithm is enhanced to process a wide range of RGB
objects, outperforming the latest generation of contour-based methods when
achieving a closed object contour, offering high peak Intersection over Union
(IoU) with impressive details. This positions WtL2 as a compelling method for
specialized applications that require detailed segmentation or high-quality
samples, potentially accelerating progress in several niche areas of image

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown camera poses remains challenging. Existing methods like NeRF and 3DGS work well for static scenes but struggle with dynamic content and require pre-computed camera poses.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Uses 3D foundational models for initial pose/geometry estimation, 2) Motion-aware refinement with MA-BA module (transformer priors + SAM2 for dynamic segmentation) and MA-GS representation (control points with deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning).

Result: Achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with large dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to previous dynamic scene representations.

Conclusion: 4D3R successfully addresses the challenge of pose-free dynamic neural rendering by effectively decoupling static and dynamic components, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency in real-world dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static
scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed
camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large
dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to
previous dynamic scene representations.

*Jiang Lin,Xinyu Chen,Song Wu,Zhiqiu Zhang,Jizhi Zhang,Ye Wang,Qiang Tang,Qian Wang,Jian Yang,Zili Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeControl is a training-free framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models that enables efficient guidance without inversion or retraining through one-step attention extraction and Latent-Condition Decoupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ControlNet require handcrafted condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility, while inversion-based approaches have high inference costs due to dual-path denoising.

Method: Performs one-step attention extraction from a single optimal key timestep and reuses it throughout denoising, with Latent-Condition Decoupling to separate key timestep and noised latent for finer control.

Result: Enables structurally and semantically aligned generation directly from raw images with approximately 5% additional cost, supporting compositional control via reference images from multiple sources.

Conclusion: FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control in diffusion models, providing flexible, efficient structural guidance without training or inversion overhead.

Abstract: Controlling the spatial and semantic structure of diffusion-generated images
remains a challenge. Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted
condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization.
Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference
cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free
framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior
methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs
one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and
reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance
without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we
introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key
timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer
control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl
also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from
multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt
alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control,
enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation
directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional
design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5
percent additional cost.

### [43] [Accurate online action and gesture recognition system using detectors and Deep SPD Siamese Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05250)
*Mohamed Sanim Akremi,Rim Slama,Hedi Tabia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an online skeleton-based motion recognition system using SPD matrix representation and Siamese network for continuous detection and classification of unsegmented motion sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing skeleton-based approaches focus on segment-based recognition and are unsuitable for online scenarios where continuous motion recognition from streaming data is needed for real-life applications.

Method: Uses a two-component system: detector and classifier based on Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and Siamese network. SPD matrices provide statistical representations for skeletal data, while Siamese network learns semantic similarity for motion interval prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments on hand gesture and body action benchmarks show the system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in most cases, demonstrating accurate online recognition capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively addresses online continuous motion recognition using SPD matrix representations and Siamese networks, providing flexible detection and accurate classification for unsegmented skeleton sequences.

Abstract: Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is
more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based
approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using
such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on
segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In
this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence
streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which
use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network.
The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD
matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network
enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an
unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to
recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is
flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct
extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition
benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most
cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.

### [45] [ADPretrain: Advancing Industrial Anomaly Detection via Anomaly Representation Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05245)
*Xincheng Yao,Yan Luo,Zefeng Qian,Chongyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel anomaly detection representation learning framework that learns specialized pretrained features for industrial anomaly detection, addressing limitations of ImageNet-pretrained features through angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses and pretraining on large-scale AD data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AD methods rely on ImageNet-pretrained features, but these are suboptimal due to: 1) pretraining doesn't match AD goals (distinguishing normal vs abnormal), 2) distribution shift between natural images and industrial AD images.

Method: Proposes AD-specific pretraining framework with angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize angle size and norm difference between normal/abnormal features. Uses large-scale AD dataset (RealIAD) and class-generalizable residual features to handle distribution shifts.

Result: Extensive experiments on 5 AD datasets and 5 backbones show superiority of proposed pretrained features over original features when integrated into 5 embedding-based AD methods.

Conclusion: The proposed AD-specific pretraining framework produces robust and discriminative representations that significantly improve anomaly detection performance across various datasets and backbones.

Abstract: The current mainstream and state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) methods
are substantially established on pretrained feature networks yielded by
ImageNet pretraining. However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised
pretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to
distinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and
industrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift.
The two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD
tasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained
representations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this
end, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed
for learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for
industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies),
we propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle
size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously.
To avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our
pretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD. To further
alleviate the potential shift between pretraining data and downstream AD
datasets, we learn the pretrained AD representations based on the
class-generalizable representation, residual features. For evaluation, based on
five embedding-based AD methods, we simply replace their original features with
our pretrained representations. Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and
five backbones consistently show the superiority of our pretrained features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepEyesV2 is an agentic multimodal model that integrates tool use (code execution, web search) with reasoning. It uses a two-stage training pipeline: cold-start for tool-use patterns and reinforcement learning for refinement, achieving effective real-world multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic multimodal models need to actively invoke external tools and integrate these operations into reasoning, but direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust tool-use behavior.

Method: Two-stage training pipeline: cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning stage to refine tool invocation. Uses a diverse, moderately challenging training dataset with examples where tool use is beneficial.

Result: DeepEyesV2 demonstrates effectiveness across real-world understanding, mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. It exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation and reinforcement learning enables complex tool combinations and selective tool invocation based on context.

Conclusion: The study provides guidance for developing agentic multimodal models, showing that the two-stage training approach enables robust tool-use behavior and effective integration of multiple capabilities including perception, search, and reasoning.

Abstract: Agentic multimodal models should not only comprehend text and images, but
also actively invoke external tools, such as code execution environments and
web search, and integrate these operations into reasoning. In this work, we
introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from
the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation.
We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust
tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a
cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning
stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately
challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is
beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires
the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and
reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2
exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for
perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement
learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to
selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide
guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online Video-LLMs struggle with simultaneous continuous frame processing and optimal response timing determination, compromising real-time responsiveness and narrative coherence.

Method: Incorporates incremental video-language alignment training, response-silence decoding framework for proactive timing, and memory-aware acceleration with peak-end compression and streaming key-value cache.

Result: Achieves 19.5% improvement in semantic correctness, 18.1% reduced timing difference, and 12.0% FPS improvement across five OmniStar tasks compared to existing online Video-LLMs.

Conclusion: LiveStar demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in online video understanding with enhanced real-time responsiveness and narrative coherence.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) for
offline video understanding, existing online Video-LLMs typically struggle to
simultaneously process continuous frame-by-frame inputs and determine optimal
response timing, often compromising real-time responsiveness and narrative
coherence. To address these limitations, we introduce LiveStar, a pioneering
live streaming assistant that achieves always-on proactive responses through
adaptive streaming decoding. Specifically, LiveStar incorporates: (1) a
training strategy enabling incremental video-language alignment for
variable-length video streams, preserving temporal consistency across
dynamically evolving frame sequences; (2) a response-silence decoding framework
that determines optimal proactive response timing via a single forward pass
verification; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression for
online inference on 10+ minute videos, combined with streaming key-value cache
to achieve 1.53x faster inference. We also construct an OmniStar dataset, a
comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking that encompasses 15 diverse
real-world scenarios and 5 evaluation tasks for online video understanding.
Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate LiveStar's
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average 19.5% improvement in
semantic correctness with 18.1% reduced timing difference compared to existing
online Video-LLMs, while improving FPS by 12.0% across all five OmniStar tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper exposes flaws in current point cloud evaluation metrics, proposes improved metrics including Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), and introduces Diffusion Point Transformer for state-of-the-art point cloud generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics for evaluating generated point clouds lack robustness and fail to capture geometric fidelity. There's a need for better evaluation methods and improved generative models for 3D point clouds.

Method: Proposed replacing Chamfer Distance with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD), introduced Surface Normal Concordance (SNC) metric, and developed Diffusion Point Transformer using transformer-based architecture with serialized patch attention.

Result: Extensive experiments on ShapeNet dataset show the proposed model outperforms previous solutions, achieving new state-of-the-art in point cloud generation quality.

Conclusion: The combination of improved evaluation metrics (DCD and SNC) with the novel Diffusion Point Transformer architecture provides a comprehensive framework for robust point cloud generation and evaluation.

Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for
sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown
exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics
for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer
Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric
fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We
further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation
and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet
essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud
generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on
directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named
Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by
comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with
traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of
generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based
models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we
propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the
Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons
on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions,
particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new
state-of-the-art. Code available at

TL;DR: CuisineSense is a wearable system that classifies Chinese food types using smartwatch hand motion and smart glasses head dynamics, achieving high accuracy in eating detection and food classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional food intake monitoring methods have limitations: self-reporting suffers from recall bias, camera-based approaches raise privacy concerns, and existing wearable methods only cover limited food types, failing to address the diversity of Chinese cuisine.

Method: A two-stage detection pipeline: first stage identifies eating states by distinguishing temporal patterns from non-eating behaviors, second stage performs fine-grained food type recognition using hand motion from smartwatch and head dynamics from smart glasses.

Result: Evaluated on a dataset of 27.5 hours of IMU recordings across 11 food categories and 10 participants, CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food classification.

Conclusion: CuisineSense offers a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based dietary monitoring that addresses the diversity of Chinese cuisine while maintaining privacy.

Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic
disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias,
while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore,
existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food
types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of
Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that
classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch
with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily
activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage
identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns
from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food
type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate
CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings
across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that
CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food
classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based
dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at

display step-by-step instructions. For each assembly step, the system displays
a bounding box around the corresponding components in the physical space, and
where the component should be placed. By connecting assembly instructions with

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual place recognition fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity in unstructured environments like planetary exploration. Current methods are limited to retrieval without pose estimation.

Method: Two-stage visual retrieval using DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for candidate screening, combined with SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric verification and explicit 6-DoF pose estimation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision on S3LI datasets, enhances pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions, and provides interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends.

Conclusion: MPRF achieves favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, demonstrating foundation models' potential to unify place recognition and pose estimation for robust loop closure in challenging environments.

Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as
in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place
recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based
methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a
multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both
vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely
unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF
integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose
estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient
candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric
verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show
that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while
enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing
interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current steganography struggles with embedding semantically rich, sentence-level information, which is increasingly important in the AIGC era where steganography capacity is critical.

Method: Proposes S^2LM (Semantic Steganographic Language Model) that uses LLMs to embed high-level textual information into images through a novel pipeline where LLMs are involved throughout the entire process.

Result: Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic capabilities for LLMs, enabling hiding of arbitrary sentence-level messages in cover images.

Conclusion: The work presents a benchmark (IVT) for evaluation and shows that S^2LM enables integration of semantically rich content, representing a significant advancement in semantic steganography.

Abstract: Although steganography has made significant advancements in recent years, it
still struggles to embed semantically rich, sentence-level information into
carriers. However, in the era of AIGC, the capacity of steganography is more
critical than ever. In this work, we present Sentence-to-Image Steganography,
an instance of Semantic Steganography, a novel task that enables the hiding of
arbitrary sentence-level messages within a cover image. Furthermore, we
establish a benchmark named Invisible Text (IVT), comprising a diverse set of
sentence-level texts as secret messages for evaluation. Finally, we present
$\mathbf{S^2LM}$: Semantic Steganographic Language Model, which utilizes large
language models (LLMs) to embed high-level textual information, such as
sentences or even paragraphs, into images. Unlike traditional bit-level
counterparts, $\mathrm{S^2LM}$ enables the integration of semantically rich
content through a newly designed pipeline in which the LLM is involved
throughout the entire process. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic

TL;DR: CanonSeg4D: A 4D panoptic segmentation framework for articulated objects that maps observed parts to canonical space for improved temporal consistency and segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore temporal dynamics in articulated object perception, and 4D temporal data remains unexplored for panoptic segmentation. Lack of benchmark datasets hinders progress in this field.

Method: Proposes CanonSeg4D framework that estimates per-frame offsets to map observed object parts to learned canonical space, enabling consistent part alignment across sequential frames.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on Artic4D dataset show CanonSeg4D outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy, especially in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling and canonical alignment are effective for dynamic object understanding, paving the way for advances in 4D articulated object perception.

Abstract: Articulated object perception presents significant challenges in computer
vision, particularly because most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics
despite the inherently dynamic nature of such objects. The use of 4D temporal
data has not been thoroughly explored in articulated object perception and
remains unexamined for panoptic segmentation. The lack of a benchmark dataset
further hurt this field. To this end, we introduce Artic4D as a new dataset
derived from PartNet Mobility and augmented with synthetic sensor data,
featuring 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters. Building on this
dataset, we propose CanonSeg4D, a novel 4D panoptic segmentation framework.
This approach explicitly estimates per-frame offsets mapping observed object
parts to a learned canonical space, thereby enhancing part-level segmentation.
The framework employs this canonical representation to achieve consistent
alignment of object parts across sequential frames. Comprehensive experiments
on Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the
art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical
alignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances
in 4D articulated object perception.

Result: DEMO substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo dataset and adapted benchmarks, establishing strong baseline for 3D motion understanding.

Conclusion: The work addresses the gap in motion understanding research and provides comprehensive dataset and model for dense motion captioning, enabling future advancements in 3D motion analysis.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D human motion and language integration have primarily
focused on text-to-motion generation, leaving the task of motion understanding
relatively unexplored. We introduce Dense Motion Captioning, a novel task that
aims to temporally localize and caption actions within 3D human motion
sequences. Current datasets fall short in providing detailed temporal
annotations and predominantly consist of short sequences featuring few actions.
To overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo),
the first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion
sequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed
data generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each
composed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately
annotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that
integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to
generate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO
substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted
benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion
understanding and captioning.

### [56] [PreResQ-R1: Towards Fine-Grained Rank-and-Score Reinforcement Learning for Visual Quality Assessment via Preference-Response Disentangled Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05393)
*Zehui Feng,Tian Qiu,Tong Wu,Junxuan Li,Huayuan Xu,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PreResQ-R1 is a novel reinforcement learning framework for visual quality assessment that combines absolute score regression and relative ranking consistency through preference-response disentangled optimization, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models for quality assessment rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, leading to shallow reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization.

Method: Proposes PreResQ-R1 with dual-branch reward formulation separating intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). For video quality assessment, uses global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5 VQA benchmarks, surpassing by 5.30% and 2.15% in IQA task under SRCC and PLCC metrics respectively, with only 6K images and 28K videos for reinforcement fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The framework enables fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning about perceptual quality, producing human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal perceptual cues underlying quality judgments.

Abstract: Visual Quality Assessment (QA) seeks to predict human perceptual judgments of
visual fidelity. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly
rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow
reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We
propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning
framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking
consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior
QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that
separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference
alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design
encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning
about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a
global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality
Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and
28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5
VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30%
and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it
produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues
underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.

*Junwen Pan,Qizhe Zhang,Rui Zhang,Ming Lu,Xin Wan,Yuan Zhang,Chang Liu,Qi She*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeSearch-R reformulates temporal search as interleaved text-video thinking using reinforcement learning with a novel GRPO-CSV method that verifies search completeness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on temporal search and long-form video understanding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing temporal search methods rely on hand-crafted search processes without end-to-end optimization, lacking learned optimal search strategies for identifying minimal relevant frames from thousands in long videos.

Method: Proposes TimeSearch-R with GRPO-CSV (Group Relative Policy Optimization with Completeness Self-Verification) that integrates searching video clips into reasoning via RL, using the same policy model to verify search frame adequacy and ensure reasoning completeness.

Result: Achieves significant improvements on temporal search benchmarks (Haystack-LVBench, Haystack-Ego4D) and long-form video understanding benchmarks (VideoMME, MLVU), establishing new SOTA on LongVideoBench with 4.1% improvement over Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over Video-R1.

Conclusion: TimeSearch-R's interleaved text-video thinking with GRPO-CSV effectively addresses unsupervised intermediate search decisions in RL-based video reasoning, improving temporal search capabilities and long-form video understanding through completeness verification.

Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens
of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate
long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow
the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted
search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search
strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal
search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching
video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate
search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content
and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO
with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video
frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy
model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the
completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets
specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,
filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task
difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal
search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as
long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,
TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%
improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video
reasoning model Video-R1. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PALM is a large-scale hand dataset with 13k scans from 263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, addressing the challenge of creating personalized hand avatars from images. PALM-Net uses this data to learn hand geometry and material priors for realistic single-image hand avatar personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating high-quality personalized hand avatars from images is challenging due to complex geometry, appearance, articulation, unconstrained lighting, and limited views. Lack of diverse datasets with accurate 3D geometry and high-resolution imagery has limited progress.

Method: Created PALM dataset with 13k hand scans from 263 subjects and 90k multi-view images capturing diverse skin tones, ages, and geometries. Developed PALM-Net baseline using multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via physically based inverse rendering.

Result: PALM provides a large-scale, diverse real-world resource for hand modeling. PALM-Net enables realistic, relightable single-image hand avatar personalization by leveraging the learned priors from the dataset.

Conclusion: PALM's scale and diversity make it a valuable resource for hand modeling and related research, addressing previous limitations in dataset availability and enabling more realistic hand avatar creation from single images.

Abstract: The ability to grasp objects, signal with gestures, and share emotion through
touch all stem from the unique capabilities of human hands. Yet creating
high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to
complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under
unconstrained lighting and limited views. Progress has also been limited by the
lack of datasets that jointly provide accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution
multiview imagery, and a diverse population of subjects. To address this, we
present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from
263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone,
age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a
multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via
physically based inverse rendering, enabling realistic, relightable
single-image hand avatar personalization. PALM's scale and diversity make it a
valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel continual learning approach for image restoration that modifies convolution layers to adapt knowledge from previous tasks without architectural changes, enabling seamless integration into existing models with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual learning methods for image restoration require heavy architectural modifications and suffer from computational overhead. Regularization-based approaches are unsuitable as different restoration tasks need different feature processing.

Method: Proposes a simple modification of convolution layers to adapt knowledge from previous restoration tasks without changing the main backbone architecture. The approach increases trainable parameters without significantly increasing computational cost or inference time.

Result: Experimental validation shows new restoration tasks can be introduced without compromising performance on existing tasks. Performance on new tasks improves by leveraging knowledge from previous restoration tasks.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective solution for continual learning in image restoration that can be seamlessly applied to any deep architecture without structural modifications, addressing the unique challenges of handling large images and diverse degradations.

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where
a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without
forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous
advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image
restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various
degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However,
existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new
task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead.
Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different
restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this
direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt
the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main
backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep
architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we
demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters
without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time.
Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be
introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show
that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge
from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks. The code is

Motivation: To create synchronized talking faces from text without ground-truth audio at inference, addressing distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted features while preserving speaker identity and achieving natural, expressive results.

Method: Two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and finetuning on TTS outputs, with a Text-to-Vec module generating latent speech representations that jointly condition speech and face generation.

Result: Conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines, improving both lip-sync accuracy and visual realism while maintaining speaker identity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully generates natural, expressive speech and synchronized facial motion from text without ground-truth audio, demonstrating superior performance over traditional cascaded approaches.

Abstract: We propose a text-to-talking-face synthesis framework leveraging latent
speech representations from HierSpeech++. A Text-to-Vec module generates
Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which jointly condition speech and face
generation. To handle distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted
features, we adopt a two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and
finetuning on TTS outputs. This enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves
speaker identity, and produces natural, expressive speech and synchronized
facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that
conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines,
improving both lip-sync and visual realism.

TL;DR: gitmerge3D reduces token redundancy in 3D transformers by 90-95% while maintaining performance, challenging the assumption that more tokens yield better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D point cloud transformers use dense token representations that are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, with substantial token redundancy.

Method: Proposed globally informed graph token merging method to reduce token count by identifying and merging redundant tokens in 3D transformer models.

Result: Achieved 90-95% token reduction while maintaining competitive performance across multiple 3D vision tasks, with consistent improvements in computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Many current 3D transformer models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for scalability, highlighting the need for more efficient 3D foundation architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art
results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However,
these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high
computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we
present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to
substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph
token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while
maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing
assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights
that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for
scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show
consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to
assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into
the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and

*Olivier Dietrich,Merlin Alfredsson,Emilia Arens,Nando Metzger,Torben Peters,Linus Scheibenreif,Jan Dirk Wegner,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medium-resolution Copernicus satellite imagery (Sentinel-1/2) can effectively detect building damage for rapid disaster assessment, with simpler models performing better than complex architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for rapid damage assessment after natural disasters, complementing limited very-high resolution imagery with more widely available medium-resolution data.

Method: Created xBD-S12 dataset with 10,315 pre/post-disaster image pairs from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, aligned with xBD benchmark. Tested various model architectures for damage detection.

Result: Building damage can be detected well despite 10m resolution. Simpler models generalize better to unseen disasters than complex architectures. Geospatial foundation models provide little practical benefit.

Conclusion: Copernicus imagery is viable for wide-area damage assessment and should complement VHR imagery. Dataset and models released for further research.

Abstract: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian
response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation
images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment,
complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We
introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from
both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the
established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster
scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find
that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does
not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to
struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation
models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus
images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and
could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12
dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.

TL;DR: A novel photo dating method using facial information to estimate when photos were taken, with a new 1.6M face dataset and probabilistic framework combining face recognition, age estimation, and temporal priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more accurate photo dating method by leveraging facial information from multiple people in images, overcoming limitations of scene-based approaches.

Method: Probabilistic framework combining modern face recognition, age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors; uses multi-face information aggregation from the CSFD-1.6M dataset.

Result: Aggregating evidence from multiple faces consistently improves performance; significantly outperforms scene-based baselines, especially for images with several identifiable individuals.

Conclusion: Multi-face information aggregation provides superior photo dating accuracy compared to traditional scene-based methods, with the approach being particularly effective for images containing multiple identifiable people.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for Photo Dating which estimates the year a
photograph was taken by leveraging information from the faces of people present
in the image. To facilitate this research, we publicly release CSFD-1.6M, a new
dataset containing over 1.6 million annotated faces, primarily from movie
stills, with identity and birth year annotations. Uniquely, our dataset
provides annotations for multiple individuals within a single image, enabling
the study of multi-face information aggregation. We propose a probabilistic
framework that formally combines visual evidence from modern face recognition
and age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer the photo
capture year. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregating evidence from
multiple faces consistently improves the performance and the approach
significantly outperforms strong, scene-based baselines, particularly for

TL;DR: Proposes a real-time flow regime classification framework using neuromorphic sensors that achieves 97.6% accuracy with 0.28ms processing time, outperforming conventional optical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow boiling is efficient but sudden flow regime shifts disrupt thermal performance and reliability. Conventional optical imaging has high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution for capturing transient flow behavior.

Method: Developed five classification models using both traditional image data and event-based data from neuromorphic sensors. The event-based LSTM model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed. Uses asynchronous processing pipeline with majority voting for stable output.

Result: Event-based models outperform frame-based approaches due to sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Event-based LSTM achieves 97.6% classification accuracy with 0.28ms processing time. Enables reliable real-time feedback for experimental control.

Conclusion: Neuromorphic sensor-based framework provides accurate, low-latency real-time monitoring of flow regimes, overcoming limitations of conventional optical methods and enabling intelligent thermal management.

Abstract: Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating
high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal
management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt
thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate
and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are
limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution,
making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this,
we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for
flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness
at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling
fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing
event-based information. We develop five classification models using both
traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models
leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their
sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long
short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed,
achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our
asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions
and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling
reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal
management.

such as ELAN, MSP, and CSP to optimize feature extraction and fusion. By
employing lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques, the system aligns semantic

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupKAN improves medical image segmentation by using grouped Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation models face trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability. Convolutional networks lack adaptive nonlinearity, Transformers have high complexity and opacity, and U-KAN has scalability limitations due to O(C^2) complexity.

Method: Introduces two novel modules: Grouped KAN Transform (partitions channels into groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing complexity to O(C^2/G)) and Grouped KAN Activation (applies shared spline-based mappings within channel groups for efficient token-wise nonlinearity).

Result: Achieves 79.80% average IoU on medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, CVC), surpassing U-KAN by +1.11% while using only 47.6% of parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M), with improved interpretability.

Conclusion: GroupKAN provides an effective solution for medical image segmentation by balancing accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability through structured functional modules that overcome the scalability limitations of previous KAN-based approaches.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires models that are accurate, lightweight,
and interpretable. Convolutional architectures lack adaptive nonlinearity and
transparent decision-making, whereas Transformer architectures are hindered by
quadratic complexity and opaque attention mechanisms. U-KAN addresses these
challenges using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving higher accuracy than
both convolutional and attention-based methods, fewer parameters than
Transformer variants, and improved interpretability compared to conventional
approaches. However, its O(C^2) complexity due to full-channel transformations
limits its scalability as the number of channels increases. To overcome this,
we introduce GroupKAN, a lightweight segmentation network that incorporates two
novel, structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform, which
partitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing
complexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation, which applies shared
spline-based mappings within each channel group for efficient, token-wise
nonlinearity. Evaluated on three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, and CVC),
GroupKAN achieves an average IoU of 79.80 percent, surpassing U-KAN by +1.11
percent while requiring only 47.6 percent of the parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M),
and shows improved interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance spatial awareness in Vision-Language Models without adding extra expert encoders that cause overhead and harm general capabilities, aiming for human-like visuospatial abilities.

Method: Progressive training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on VST-P dataset (4.1M samples across 19 spatial skills) followed by reinforcement learning on VST-R dataset (135K samples) for spatial reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on spatial benchmarks: 34.8% on MMSI-Bench and 61.2% on VSIBench, with no negative impact on general capabilities.

Conclusion: Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced through spatial tuning, paving the way for more physically grounded AI systems.

Abstract: Capturing spatial relationships from visual inputs is a cornerstone of
human-like general intelligence. Several previous studies have tried to enhance
the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert
encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.
To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual
Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with
human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We
first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a
large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning
19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present
VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in
space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement
learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the
side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves
state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on
MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the
Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed
spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.

### [68] [Stateful KV Cache Management for LLMs: Balancing Space, Time, Accuracy, and Positional Fidelity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04686)
*Pratik Poudel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KV cache management in LLMs must preserve positional encoding integrity to avoid performance degradation when cache exceeds trained context limits, rather than just focusing on cache size reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of unbounded KV cache growth in stateful multi-turn LLM scenarios and the overlooked issue of positional encoding disruption from eviction strategies.

Method: Empirical analysis using stateful benchmarking framework to test KV cache management strategies, examining performance when cache approaches/exceeds model's trained context window (e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3).

Result: LLM generation quality degrades sharply when accumulated KV cache exceeds trained context window; common eviction strategies worsen performance by disrupting positional coherence; preserving contiguous context blocks yields more coherent generations.

Conclusion: KV cache eviction techniques should respect architectural limits, preserve positional structure, and consider "cache health" holistically beyond mere size reduction.

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is integral to efficient autoregressive inference in
large language models (LLMs), yet its unbounded growth in stateful multi-turn
scenarios presents major challenges. This paper examines the interplay between
KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like
meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of
positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking
framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the
accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window
(e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory
exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via
AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence.
Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a
cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to
degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving
contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial "gist") can yield more
coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate
for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional
structure, and view "cache health" holistically beyond mere size.

*Yue Xun,Jiaxing Xu,Wenbo Gao,Chen Yang,Shujun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel fMRI analysis framework that adaptively learns frequency sub-bands and captures cross-band interactions for improved brain disorder classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fMRI models overlook the multi-frequency nature of neuronal oscillations and use predefined frequency bands, limiting diagnostic sensitivity for neurological disorders that manifest in specific frequency bands.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Cascade Decomposition to learn task-relevant frequency sub-bands per brain region, Frequency-Coupled Connectivity Learning for intra- and cross-band interactions, and Unified-GCN with novel message-passing for diagnostic prediction.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on ADNI and ABIDE datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively captures frequency-specific neurological disruptions and improves brain disorder classification through adaptive frequency learning and unified network modeling.

Abstract: Resting-state fMRI has become a valuable tool for classifying brain disorders
and constructing brain functional connectivity networks
  by tracking BOLD signals across brain regions. However, existing mod els
largely neglect the multi-frequency nature of neuronal oscillations,
  treating BOLD signals as monolithic time series. This overlooks the cru cial
fact that neurological disorders often manifest as disruptions within
  specific frequency bands, limiting diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
  While some methods have attempted to incorporate frequency informa tion, they
often rely on predefined frequency bands, which may not be
  optimal for capturing individual variability or disease-specific alterations.
  To address this, we propose a novel framework featuring Adaptive Cas cade
Decomposition to learn task-relevant frequency sub-bands for each
  brain region and Frequency-Coupled Connectivity Learning to capture
  both intra- and nuanced cross-band interactions in a unified functional
  network. This unified network informs a novel message-passing mecha nism
within our Unified-GCN, generating refined node representations
  for diagnostic prediction. Experimental results on the ADNI and ABIDE
  datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing methods. The
  code is available at https://github.com/XXYY20221234/Ada-FCN.

*Qianyang Li,Xingjun Zhang,Peng Tao,Shaoxun Wang,Yancheng Pan,Jia Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AWEMixer is a novel time series forecasting model that combines wavelet analysis with frequency routing to address non-stationary IoT sensor signals, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-term forecasting tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time series forecasting methods struggle with non-stationary, multi-scale IoT sensor signals and suffer from error accumulation in long-term predictions. Frequency-domain methods using Fourier transform treat signals as stationary, blurring temporal patterns of transient events.

Method: AWEMixer includes two key components: 1) Frequency Router that uses FFT-derived global periodicity to adaptively weight localized wavelet subbands, and 2) Coherent Gated Fusion Block that selectively integrates frequency features with multi-scale temporal representations using cross-attention and gating mechanisms.

Result: The model was validated on seven public benchmarks and consistently outperformed transformer-based and MLP-based state-of-the-art models in long-sequence time series forecasting.

Conclusion: AWEMixer effectively addresses the challenges of non-stationary IoT time series forecasting by combining time-frequency localization with noise robustness, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Forecasting long-term time series in IoT environments remains a significant
challenge due to the non-stationary and multi-scale characteristics of sensor
signals. Furthermore, error accumulation causes a decrease in forecast quality
when predicting further into the future. Traditional methods are restricted to
operate in time-domain, while the global frequency information achieved by
Fourier transform would be regarded as stationary signals leading to blur the
temporal patterns of transient events. We propose AWEMixer, an Adaptive
Wavelet-Enhanced Mixer Network including two innovative components: 1) a
Frequency Router designs to utilize the global periodicity pattern achieved by
Fast Fourier Transform to adaptively weight localized wavelet subband, and 2) a
Coherent Gated Fusion Block to achieve selective integration of prominent
frequency features with multi-scale temporal representation through
cross-attention and gating mechanism, which realizes accurate time-frequency
localization while remaining robust to noise. Seven public benchmarks validate
that our model is more effective than recent state-of-the-art models.
Specifically, our model consistently achieves performance improvement compared
with transformer-based and MLP-based state-of-the-art models in long-sequence
time series forecasting. Code is available at

*Mohamadreza Akbari Pour,Mohamad Sadeq Karimi,Amir Hossein Mazloumi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework combining Temporal Convolutional Networks with enhanced Temporal Fusion Transformer and Bi-LSTM for improved Remaining Useful Life prediction in industrial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RUL prediction models struggle with capturing fine-grained temporal dependencies and dynamically prioritizing critical features across time for robust prognostics.

Method: Integrates TCNs for localized temporal feature extraction with modified TFT enhanced by Bi-LSTM encoder-decoder, using multi-time-window methodology for adaptability.

Result: Reduces average RMSE by up to 5.5% compared to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The framework advances industrial prognostic systems by bridging short- and long-term dependencies while emphasizing salient temporal patterns, demonstrating the potential of advanced time-series transformers for RUL prediction.

Abstract: Health prediction is crucial for ensuring reliability, minimizing downtime,
and optimizing maintenance in industrial systems. Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
prediction is a key component of this process; however, many existing models
struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies while dynamically
prioritizing critical features across time for robust prognostics. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates Temporal
Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for localized temporal feature extraction with a
modified Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) enhanced by Bi-LSTM encoder-decoder.
This architecture effectively bridges short- and long-term dependencies while
emphasizing salient temporal patterns. Furthermore, the incorporation of a
multi-time-window methodology improves adaptability across diverse operating
conditions. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed model reduces the average RMSE by up to 5.5%, underscoring its
improved predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. By closing
critical gaps in current approaches, this framework advances the effectiveness
of industrial prognostic systems and highlights the potential of advanced
time-series transformers for RUL prediction.

*Matteo Cercola,Michele Lomuscio,Dario Piga,Simone Formentin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A sensor-guided regularized extension of GLISp that integrates sensor measurements into preference-based optimization for faster convergence and better solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference-based optimization methods treat systems as black boxes and ignore informative sensor measurements, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Extends GLISp by integrating measurable descriptors through a physics-informed hypothesis function and least-squares regularization term, combining subjective feedback with quantitative sensor data.

Result: Shows faster convergence and superior final solutions compared to baseline GLISp in both analytical benchmarks and human-in-the-loop vehicle suspension tuning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully injects grey-box structure into preference-based optimization, combining the flexibility of preference learning with the benefits of sensor information.

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop calibration is often addressed via preference-based
optimization, where algorithms learn from pairwise comparisons rather than
explicit cost evaluations. While effective, methods such as Preferential
Bayesian Optimization or Global optimization based on active preference
learning with radial basis functions (GLISp) treat the system as a black box
and ignore informative sensor measurements. In this work, we introduce a
sensor-guided regularized extension of GLISp that integrates measurable
descriptors into the preference-learning loop through a physics-informed
hypothesis function and a least-squares regularization term. This injects
grey-box structure, combining subjective feedback with quantitative sensor
information while preserving the flexibility of preference-based search.
Numerical evaluations on an analytical benchmark and on a human-in-the-loop
vehicle suspension tuning task show faster convergence and superior final
solutions compared to baseline GLISp.

*Vaibhav Singh,Eugene Belilovsky,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Knowledge Distillation from grokked models enables and accelerates grokking in data-scarce regimes and distribution shift scenarios, overcoming limitations of standard training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of grokking (delayed generalization) in data-scarce settings where training samples fall below critical thresholds, and to enable adaptation to new distributions with limited data.

Method: Using Knowledge Distillation (KD) from models that have already grokked on one distribution to induce grokking on different distributions, even with insufficient data. Also studied joint distribution training and continual pretraining setups.

Result: KD successfully induces and accelerates grokking on new distributions below critical data thresholds, enables generalization on joint distributions where standard training fails, and mitigates catastrophic forgetting in continual learning with only 10% of data.

Conclusion: Knowledge Distillation plays a central role in enabling generalization in low-data and evolving distribution settings, providing new insights into grokking mechanics under knowledge transfer.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of grokking, where models
exhibit delayed generalization following overfitting on training data. We focus
on data-scarce regimes where the number of training samples falls below the
critical threshold, making grokking unobservable, and on practical scenarios
involving distribution shift. We first show that Knowledge Distillation (KD)
from a model that has already grokked on a distribution (p1) can induce and
accelerate grokking on a different distribution (p2), even when the available
data lies below the critical threshold. This highlights the value of KD for
deployed models that must adapt to new distributions under limited data. We
then study training on the joint distribution (p1, p2) and demonstrate that
while standard supervised training fails when either distribution has
insufficient data, distilling from models grokked on the individual
distributions enables generalization. Finally, we examine a continual
pretraining setup, where a grokked model transitions from p1 to p2, and find
that KD both accelerates generalization and mitigates catastrophic forgetting,
achieving strong performance even with only 10% of the data. Together, our
results provide new insights into the mechanics of grokking under knowledge
transfer and underscore the central role of KD in enabling generalization in
low-data and evolving distribution settings.

TL;DR: FuseFlow is a compiler that converts sparse PyTorch models to fused sparse dataflow graphs for reconfigurable dataflow architectures, supporting cross-expression fusion and achieving up to 2.7x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As deep learning models scale, sparse computation and specialized dataflow hardware are needed to address efficiency challenges.

Method: FuseFlow converts sparse PyTorch models to fused sparse dataflow graphs, supports cross-expression fusion, parallelization, dataflow ordering, and sparsity blocking, and targets a cycle-accurate simulator.

Result: FuseFlow shows that full fusion is not always optimal for sparse models - fusion granularity depends on the model. It achieves ~2.7x speedup over unfused baseline for GPT-3 with BigBird block-sparse attention.

Conclusion: FuseFlow provides a compiler solution for sparse model optimization on reconfigurable dataflow architectures, with a heuristic to identify optimal fusion strategies.

Abstract: As deep learning models scale, sparse computation and specialized dataflow
hardware have emerged as powerful solutions to address efficiency. We propose
FuseFlow, a compiler that converts sparse machine learning models written in
PyTorch to fused sparse dataflow graphs for reconfigurable dataflow
architectures (RDAs). FuseFlow is the first compiler to support general
cross-expression fusion of sparse operations. In addition to fusion across
kernels (expressions), FuseFlow also supports optimizations like
parallelization, dataflow ordering, and sparsity blocking. It targets a
cycle-accurate dataflow simulator for microarchitectural analysis of fusion
strategies. We use FuseFlow for design-space exploration across four real-world
machine learning applications with sparsity, showing that full fusion (entire
cross-expression fusion across all computation in an end-to-end model) is not
always optimal for sparse models-fusion granularity depends on the model
itself. FuseFlow also provides a heuristic to identify and prune suboptimal
configurations. Using Fuseflow, we achieve performance improvements, including
a ~2.7x speedup over an unfused baseline for GPT-3 with BigBird block-sparse
attention.

*Liu Jiang,Zerui Bao,Shiqi Sheng,Di Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel instruction prefetching design for cloud workloads that combines compressed entries, hierarchical metadata storage, and online ML control to reduce tail latency and energy while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale networked services with deep software stacks and microservice orchestration create frontend stalls that increase tail latency and energy consumption, requiring improved instruction prefetching solutions.

Method: Builds on EIP with Compressed Entries (capturing 8 destinations in 36 bits), Hierarchical Metadata Storage (keeping only L1/frequent entries on-chip), and Online ML Controller (scoring prefetch profitability with context features and bandit-adjusted threshold).

Result: Preserves EIP-like speedups with smaller on-chip state and improves efficiency for networked services in the ML era.

Conclusion: The proposed instruction prefetching design effectively addresses frontend stalls in cloud workloads while optimizing resource usage and maintaining performance gains.

Abstract: Large-scale networked services rely on deep soft-ware stacks and microservice
orchestration, which increase instruction footprints and create frontend stalls
that inflate tail latency and energy. We revisit instruction prefetching for
these cloud workloads and present a design that aligns with SLO driven and self
optimizing systems. Building on the Entangling Instruction Prefetcher (EIP), we
introduce a Compressed Entry that captures up to eight destinations around a
base using 36 bits by exploiting spatial clustering, and a Hierarchical
Metadata Storage scheme that keeps only L1 resident and frequently queried
entries on chip while virtualizing bulk metadata into lower levels. We further
add a lightweight Online ML Controller that scores prefetch profitability using
context features and a bandit adjusted threshold. On data center applications,
our approach preserves EIP like speedups with smaller on chip state and
improves efficiency for networked services in the ML era.

*Xiaoda Wang,Yuji Zhao,Kaiqiao Han,Xiao Luo,Sanne van Rooij,Jennifer Stevens,Lifang He,Liang Zhan,Yizhou Sun,Wei Wang,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CNODE (Conditional Neural ODE) is a novel framework that models Parkinson's disease progression as continuous temporal processes using neural ODEs, handling irregular MRI data and capturing individual heterogeneity in disease trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with irregular/sparse MRI data in PD cohorts and fail to capture individual heterogeneity in disease onset, progression rate, and symptom severity, which are hallmarks of Parkinson's disease.

Method: Uses neural ODE model to represent morphological brain changes as continuous temporal processes, jointly learning patient-specific initial time and progress speed to align individual trajectories into a shared progression trajectory.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forecasting longitudinal PD progression on the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset.

Conclusion: CNODE provides an effective framework for continuous, individualized PD progression forecasting that handles irregular data and captures patient heterogeneity better than existing methods.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) shows heterogeneous, evolving brain-morphometry
patterns. Modeling these longitudinal trajectories enables mechanistic insight,
treatment development, and individualized 'digital-twin' forecasting. However,
existing methods usually adopt recurrent neural networks and transformer
architectures, which rely on discrete, regularly sampled data while struggling
to handle irregular and sparse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PD cohorts.
Moreover, these methods have difficulty capturing individual heterogeneity
including variations in disease onset, progression rate, and symptom severity,
which is a hallmark of PD. To address these challenges, we propose CNODE
(Conditional Neural ODE), a novel framework for continuous, individualized PD
progression forecasting. The core of CNODE is to model morphological brain
changes as continuous temporal processes using a neural ODE model. In addition,
we jointly learn patient-specific initial time and progress speed to align
individual trajectories into a shared progression trajectory. We validate CNODE
on the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
forecasting longitudinal PD progression.

### [77] [Causal Structure and Representation Learning with Biomedical Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04790)
*Caroline Uhler,Jiaqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating representation learning with causal inference to address limitations in predicting intervention effects, using multi-modal biomedical data for causal discovery and optimal perturbation design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Representation learning excels in predictive tasks but fails in causal tasks like predicting intervention effects. Multi-modal data availability presents an opportunity to combine these approaches for better causal understanding in biomedical applications.

Method: A statistical and computational framework that leverages multi-modal data (observational and perturbational, imaging and sequencing) to perform causal discovery, learn causal variables, and design optimal perturbations.

Result: The paper outlines a framework but does not present specific experimental results - it's a conceptual proposal for integrating representation learning with causal inference in biomedical contexts.

Conclusion: There is significant potential in combining representation learning with causal inference using multi-modal data to address fundamental biomedical questions about causal structure, variable learning, and perturbation design.

Abstract: Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of
complex phenomena and, ultimately, better decisions. Representation learning
has become a key driver of deep learning applications, as it allows learning
latent spaces that capture important properties of the data without requiring
any supervised annotations. Although representation learning has been hugely
successful in predictive tasks, it can fail miserably in causal tasks including
predicting the effect of a perturbation/intervention. This calls for a marriage
between representation learning and causal inference. An exciting opportunity
in this regard stems from the growing availability of multi-modal data
(observational and perturbational, imaging-based and sequencing-based, at the
single-cell level, tissue-level, and organism-level). We outline a statistical
and computational framework for causal structure and representation learning
motivated by fundamental biomedical questions: how to effectively use
observational and perturbational data to perform causal discovery on observed
causal variables; how to use multi-modal views of the system to learn causal
variables; and how to design optimal perturbations.

*Lei Gao,Chaoyi Jiang,Hossein Entezari Zarch,Daniel Wong,Murali Annavaram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DuetServe is an LLM serving framework that dynamically activates GPU spatial multiplexing to isolate prefill and decode phases only when needed, improving throughput while maintaining latency SLOs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM serving systems either aggregate prefill and decode phases on shared GPUs (causing interference and degraded latency) or disaggregate them across GPUs (wasting resources through duplicated models and KV cache transfers).

Method: DuetServe operates in aggregated mode by default and dynamically activates SM-level GPU spatial multiplexing when TBT degradation is predicted. It uses an attention-aware roofline model, partitioning optimizer, and interruption-free execution engine.

Result: DuetServe improves total throughput by up to 1.3x while maintaining low generation latency compared to state-of-the-art frameworks.

Conclusion: DuetServe provides a unified solution that achieves disaggregation-level isolation within a single GPU, offering the benefits of both aggregated and disaggregated approaches without their respective drawbacks.

Abstract: Modern LLM serving systems must sustain high throughput while meeting strict
latency SLOs across two distinct inference phases: compute-intensive prefill
and memory-bound decode phases. Existing approaches either (1) aggregate both
phases on shared GPUs, leading to interference between prefill and decode
phases, which degrades time-between-tokens (TBT); or (2) disaggregate the two
phases across GPUs, improving latency but wasting resources through duplicated
models and KV cache transfers. We present DuetServe, a unified LLM serving
framework that achieves disaggregation-level isolation within a single GPU.
DuetServe operates in aggregated mode by default and dynamically activates
SM-level GPU spatial multiplexing when TBT degradation is predicted. Its key
idea is to decouple prefill and decode execution only when needed through
fine-grained, adaptive SM partitioning that provides phase isolation only when
contention threatens latency service level objectives (SLOs). DuetServe
integrates (1) an attention-aware roofline model to forecast iteration latency,
(2) a partitioning optimizer that selects the optimal SM split to maximize
throughput under TBT constraints, and (3) an interruption-free execution engine
that eliminates CPU-GPU synchronization overhead. Evaluations show that
DuetServe improves total throughput by up to 1.3x while maintaining low
generation latency compared to state-of-the-art frameworks.

TL;DR: SiFEN is a learned piecewise-polynomial predictor using finite-element fields on learned simplicial meshes, offering explicit locality, controllable smoothness, and efficient inference through geometric sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a compact, interpretable, and theoretically grounded alternative to dense MLPs and edge-spline networks with better locality, smoothness control, and inference efficiency.

Method: Uses degree-m Bernstein-Bezier polynomials on learned simplicial meshes with light invertible warp, trained end-to-end with shape regularization, semi-discrete OT coverage, and differentiable edge flips.

Result: Achieves classic FEM approximation rate M^(-m/d) with M mesh vertices, matches or surpasses MLPs and KANs at matched parameters, improves calibration (lower ECE/Brier), and reduces inference latency.

Conclusion: SiFEN provides a compact, interpretable, and theoretically sound alternative to traditional neural networks with superior locality, calibration, and inference efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce Simplex-FEM Networks (SiFEN), a learned piecewise-polynomial
predictor that represents f: R^d -> R^k as a globally C^r finite-element field
on a learned simplicial mesh in an optionally warped input space. Each query
activates exactly one simplex and at most d+1 basis functions via barycentric
coordinates, yielding explicit locality, controllable smoothness, and
cache-friendly sparsity. SiFEN pairs degree-m Bernstein-Bezier polynomials with
a light invertible warp and trains end-to-end with shape regularization,
semi-discrete OT coverage, and differentiable edge flips. Under standard
shape-regularity and bi-Lipschitz warp assumptions, SiFEN achieves the classic
FEM approximation rate M^(-m/d) with M mesh vertices. Empirically, on synthetic
approximation tasks, tabular regression/classification, and as a drop-in head
on compact CNNs, SiFEN matches or surpasses MLPs and KANs at matched parameter
budgets, improves calibration (lower ECE/Brier), and reduces inference latency
due to geometric locality. These properties make SiFEN a compact,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded alternative to dense MLPs and
edge-spline networks.

TL;DR: PuzzleMoE is a training-free compression method for Mixture-of-Experts models that achieves 50% compression while maintaining accuracy through sparse expert merging and bit-packed encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models have high memory overhead due to storing all expert parameters, limiting deployment despite their efficiency benefits. Existing compression methods suffer from performance drops at high compression ratios.

Method: Uses sparse expert merging with dual-mask to identify weight redundancy and specialization, plus bit-packed encoding that reuses exponent bits to avoid storing binary masks and signs.

Result: Achieves up to 50% compression while maintaining accuracy across tasks, outperforms prior methods by up to 16.7% on MMLU at 50% compression, and achieves 1.28× inference speedup.

Conclusion: PuzzleMoE enables efficient MoE deployment by providing high compression ratios without performance degradation through training-free compression techniques.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown strong potential in scaling
language models efficiently by activating only a small subset of experts per
input. However, their widespread deployment remains limited due to the high
memory overhead associated with storing all expert parameters, particularly as
the number of experts increases. To address this challenge, prior works have
explored expert dropping and merging strategies, yet they often suffer from
performance drop at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce
PuzzleMoE, a training-free MoE compression method that achieves both high
accuracy and efficient inference through two key innovations: First, PuzzleMoE
performs sparse expert merging by identifying element-wise weight redundancy
and specialization. It uses a dual-mask to capture both shared and
expert-specific parameters. Second, to avoid the overhead of storing binary
masks and signs, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses
underutilized exponent bits, enabling efficient MoE inference on GPUs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuzzleMoE can compress MoE models by up
to 50% while maintaining accuracy across various tasks. Specifically, it
outperforms prior MoE compression methods by up to 16.7% on MMLU at 50%
compression ratio, and achieves up to 1.28\times inference speedup.

TL;DR: This paper explores topological limitations and capabilities of autoencoders for data manifolds and their application to dynamical systems with invariant manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental topological constraints and possibilities when designing autoencoders that map between data manifolds in high-dimensional spaces and lower-dimensional latent spaces.

Method: Theoretical analysis of autoencoder architectures using topological concepts, examining the continuous maps between data manifold M in R^n and latent space R^l, with focus on the composition D∘E approximating the identity on M.

Result: Identifies various topological limitations that constrain autoencoder design, while also revealing capabilities for encoding dynamical systems that have M as an invariant manifold.

Conclusion: Autoencoders have inherent topological constraints that must be considered in their design, but they also possess capabilities for representing dynamical systems with invariant manifolds, providing theoretical foundations for autoencoder applications.

Abstract: Given a "data manifold" $M\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and "latent space"
$\mathbb{R}^\ell$, an autoencoder is a pair of continuous maps consisting of an
"encoder" $E\colon \mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ and "decoder" $D\colon
\mathbb{R}^\ell\to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that the "round trip" map $D\circ E$ is
as close as possible to the identity map $\mbox{id}_M$ on $M$. We present
various topological limitations and capabilites inherent to the search for an
autoencoder, and describe capabilities for autoencoding dynamical systems
having $M$ as an invariant manifold.

*Raymond Fan,Bryce Sandlund,Lin Myat Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the volume hypothesis by showing that large datasets change the loss landscape, making previously small generalizing minima become relatively large and thus more likely to be found during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of large datasets in generalization beyond the traditional volume hypothesis, which suggests deep learning works well due to finding flat minima with large volumes.

Method: Measuring minima volumes under varying amounts of training data to analyze how data quantity affects the loss landscape and the likelihood of finding different types of minima.

Result: Found that sharp minima which generalize well exist but are unlikely to be found due to their small volumes. Increasing data changes the loss landscape so these previously small generalizing minima become relatively large.

Conclusion: Large datasets play a crucial role in generalization by transforming the loss landscape to make generalizing minima more accessible, rather than just increasing the likelihood of finding flat minima.

Abstract: The volume hypothesis suggests deep learning is effective because it is
likely to find flat minima due to their large volumes, and flat minima
generalize well. This picture does not explain the role of large datasets in
generalization. Measuring minima volumes under varying amounts of training data
reveals sharp minima which generalize well exist, but are unlikely to be found
due to their small volumes. Increasing data changes the loss landscape, such
that previously small generalizing minima become (relatively) large.

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides have emerged as promising molecules to combat
antimicrobial resistance. However, fragmented datasets, inconsistent

ESCAPE, we propose a transformer-based model that leverages sequence and
structural information to predict multiple functional activities of peptides.
Our method achieves up to a 2.56% relative average improvement in mean Average

*Luigi Caputi,Nicholas Meadows,Henri Riihimäki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Persistent reachability homology (PRH) outperforms traditional directed flag complex persistent homology (DPH) in epilepsy detection from directed graph data, using smaller digraph condensations for more effective network classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve network classification in neuroscience, specifically epilepsy detection, by developing a more efficient persistent homology method for directed graph data that considers graph condensations.

Method: Used persistent reachability homology (PRH) which considers condensations of digraphs in persistent filtration, compared against traditional directed flag complex persistent homology (DPH), with Betti curves and their integrals as features in SVM classification.

Result: PRH demonstrated superior performance over DPH in the epilepsy detection classification task, showing better effectiveness in network classification.

Conclusion: Persistent reachability homology provides a more effective approach than traditional directed flag complex methods for analyzing directed graph data in neuroscience applications like epilepsy detection.

Abstract: We explore the recently introduced persistent reachability homology (PRH) of
digraph data, i.e. data in the form of directed graphs. In particular, we study
the effectiveness of PRH in network classification task in a key neuroscience
problem: epilepsy detection. PRH is a variation of the persistent homology of
digraphs, more traditionally based on the directed flag complex (DPH). A main
advantage of PRH is that it considers the condensations of the digraphs
appearing in the persistent filtration and thus is computed from smaller
digraphs. We compare the effectiveness of PRH to that of DPH and we show that
PRH outperforms DPH in the classification task. We use the Betti curves and
their integrals as topological features and implement our pipeline on support
vector machine.

*Jiwoo Shin,Byeonghu Na,Mina Kang,Wonhyeok Choi,Il-chul Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes replacing negative prompts with implicit negative embeddings via concept inversion to improve compatibility between fine-tuning and training-free methods for text-to-image safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address incompatibility between fine-tuning and training-free guidance methods for text-to-image safety, which leads to marginal or degraded defense performance when combined.

Method: Replace negative prompts in training-free methods with implicit negative embeddings obtained through concept inversion, requiring no modification to existing approaches.

Result: Demonstrated consistent improvements in defense success rate on nudity and violence benchmarks while preserving input prompt semantics.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges the incompatibility between two orthogonal safety approaches, enabling better combined performance without pipeline modifications.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generative models have raised concerns about
their potential to produce harmful content when provided with malicious input
text prompts. To address this issue, two main approaches have emerged: (1)
fine-tuning the model to unlearn harmful concepts and (2) training-free
guidance methods that leverage negative prompts. However, we observe that
combining these two orthogonal approaches often leads to marginal or even
degraded defense performance. This observation indicates a critical
incompatibility between two paradigms, which hinders their combined
effectiveness. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a conceptually
simple yet experimentally robust method: replacing the negative prompts used in
training-free methods with implicit negative embeddings obtained through
concept inversion. Our method requires no modification to either approach and
can be easily integrated into existing pipelines. We experimentally validate
its effectiveness on nudity and violence benchmarks, demonstrating consistent
improvements in defense success rate while preserving the core semantics of
input prompts.

*Brenda Nogueira,Meng Jiang,Nitesh V. Chawla,Nuno Moniz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPECTRA is a spectral target-aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular graphs to address data imbalance in molecular property prediction, particularly for rare but valuable compounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard GNNs underperform on rare but critical molecular compounds due to optimizing for average error, and existing oversampling methods often distort molecular topology.

Method: SPECTRA reconstructs molecular graphs from SMILES, aligns molecules via Gromov-Wasserstein couplings, interpolates Laplacian eigenvalues/eigenvectors/node features in stable share-basis, and reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates with interpolated targets using rarity-aware budgeting.

Result: SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry.

Conclusion: Spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.

Abstract: In molecular property prediction, the most valuable compounds (e.g., high
potency) often occupy sparse regions of the target space. Standard Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) commonly optimize for the average error, underperforming on
these uncommon but critical cases, with existing oversampling methods often
distorting molecular topology. In this paper, we introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral
Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular
graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute
molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused)
Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates
Laplacian eigenvalues, eigenvectors and node features in a stable share-basis;
and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates
with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a
kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are
scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions,
SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global accuracy.
On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges
while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic
molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry. Our
results demonstrate that spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective
and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.

*Matthew S. Zhang,Stephen Huan,Jerry Huang,Nicholas M. Boffi,Sitan Chen,Sinho Chewi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DDRaM, a new SDE-based sampling method using randomized midpoints that achieves sublinear complexity for DDPM sampling, outperforming prior methods that required ODE-based modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior DDPM analyses focused on exponential Euler discretization with linear dimension dependence, while practical sampling needs more efficient methods with sublinear complexity.

Method: Uses denoising diffusion randomized midpoint method (DDRaM) that leverages randomized midpoints to better approximate SDEs, analyzed using the "shifted composition rule" framework.

Result: Achieves sublinear O(√d) score evaluations for convergence, the first such bound for pure DDPM sampling without ODE modifications.

Conclusion: DDRaM provides theoretically grounded and practically effective sampling with sublinear complexity, validated through experiments with pre-trained image synthesis models.

Abstract: SDE-based methods such as denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have shown remarkable success in real-world sample generation tasks. Prior
analyses of DDPMs have been focused on the exponential Euler discretization,
showing guarantees that generally depend at least linearly on the dimension or
initial Fisher information. Inspired by works in log-concave sampling (Shen and
Lee, 2019), we analyze an integrator -- the denoising diffusion randomized
midpoint method (DDRaM) -- that leverages an additional randomized midpoint to
better approximate the SDE. Using a recently-developed analytic framework
called the "shifted composition rule", we show that this algorithm enjoys
favorable discretization properties under appropriate smoothness assumptions,
with sublinear $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ score evaluations needed to ensure
convergence. This is the first sublinear complexity bound for pure DDPM
sampling -- prior works which obtained such bounds worked instead with
ODE-based sampling and had to make modifications to the sampler which deviate
from how they are used in practice. We also provide experimental validation of
the advantages of our method, showing that it performs well in practice with
pre-trained image synthesis models.

*Jingchen Bi,Rodrigo Mesa-Arango*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning model used to analyze consumer preferences for food products with innovative transportation certificates in the U.S., identifying safety and energy certificates as most valued.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research showed transportation factors significantly influence consumer food purchasing choices, prompting investigation into specific transportation attributes consumers value.

Method: Applied machine learning model to analyze stated preference data from experiments that tested five innovative transportation certificates: Transportation Mode, IoT, Safety, Energy Source, and Must Arrive By Dates, while controlling for product and decision-maker factors.

Result: Consumers showed strong preference for safety and energy certificates in food transportation; study also identified influence of price, product type, certificates, and decision-maker factors on purchasing choices.

Conclusion: Provides data-driven recommendations for improving food supply chain systems based on consumer preferences for specific transportation attributes.

Abstract: This paper utilizes a machine learning model to estimate the consumer's
behavior for food products with innovative transportation certificates in the
U.S. Building on previous research that examined demand for food products with
supply chain traceability using stated preference analysis, transportation
factors were identified as significant in consumer food purchasing choices.
Consequently, a second experiment was conducted to pinpoint the specific
transportation attributes valued by consumers. A machine learning model was
applied, and five innovative certificates related to transportation were
proposed: Transportation Mode, Internet of Things (IoT), Safety measures,
Energy Source, and Must Arrive By Dates (MABDs). The preference experiment also
incorporated product-specific and decision-maker factors for control purposes.
The findings reveal a notable inclination toward safety and energy certificates
within the transportation domain of the U.S. food supply chain. Additionally,
the study examined the influence of price, product type, certificates, and
decision-maker factors on purchasing choices. Ultimately, the study offers
data-driven recommendations for improving food supply chain systems.

### [89] [Grounded Test-Time Adaptation for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04847)
*Arthur Chen,Zuxin Liu,Jianguo Zhang,Akshara Prabhakar,Zhiwei Liu,Shelby Heinecke,Silvio Savarese,Victor Zhong,Caiming Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two strategies to improve LLM agents' generalization to novel environments: online distributional adaptation for syntactic alignment and deployment-time dynamics grounding for semantic understanding of environment dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents struggle with generalization to unseen environments due to mismatches between pre-training and test-time conditions, particularly in understanding environment-specific syntax and state-transition dynamics.

Method: Two complementary strategies: 1) Online distributional adaptation using lightweight adaptation vectors for syntactic alignment, and 2) Deployment-time dynamics grounding with persona-driven exploration to learn environment dynamics before task execution.

Result: Both strategies significantly improve performance across diverse benchmarks with minimal computational cost. Dynamics grounding particularly excels in complex environments, increasing success rate from 2% to 23% on WebArena multi-site split.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide a robust path toward more generalizable LLM agents by addressing both syntactic and semantic adaptation challenges, with dynamics grounding being especially effective for complex environments with unpredictable dynamics.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and
complex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to
a fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions.
This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic
misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats,
and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only
revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct and
complementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging
environment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online
distributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by
learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output
distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format.
Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven
exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal
dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world
model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks,
including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the
effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal
computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective
in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle,
demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based
agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases
the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%.

*Shuvendu Roy,Hossein Hajimirsadeghi,Mengyao Zhai,Golnoosh Samei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Label-free RL methods for reasoning enhancement work poorly on smaller models due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Proposed curriculum learning with progressive difficulty and data curation improves performance across all model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the generalizability of unsupervised RL methods to smaller base models with limited reasoning capabilities, which remains unexplored despite advances in large language models.

Method: Systematic investigation across model sizes (0.5B-7B parameters), curriculum learning with progressive difficulty introduction, masking no-majority rollouts, and data curation pipeline for samples with predefined difficulty.

Result: Label-free RL is highly dependent on base model's pre-existing reasoning capability, with performance degrading below baseline for weaker models. Proposed approach demonstrates consistent improvements across all model sizes and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Curriculum learning and data curation provide a path toward more robust unsupervised RL that can bootstrap reasoning abilities in resource-constrained models, addressing critical limitations of current label-free RL methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the promise of
unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) methods for enhancing reasoning
capabilities without external supervision. However, the generalizability of
these label-free RL approaches to smaller base models with limited reasoning
capabilities remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate
the performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and
reasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals
critical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's
pre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below
baseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate
sufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective
self-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in
determining success. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet
effective method for label-free RL that utilizes curriculum learning to
progressively introduce harder problems during training and mask no-majority
rollouts during training. Additionally, we introduce a data curation pipeline
to generate samples with predefined difficulty. Our approach demonstrates
consistent improvements across all model sizes and reasoning capabilities,
providing a path toward more robust unsupervised RL that can bootstrap
reasoning abilities in resource-constrained models. We make our code available

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SigmaDock is an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion model that achieves state-of-the-art molecular docking performance by decomposing ligands into rigid-body fragments and learning to reassemble them in binding pockets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative approaches for molecular docking face challenges including chemically implausible outputs, poor generalizability, and high computational cost, despite promising faster and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods.

Method: The method introduces a novel fragmentation scheme that decomposes ligands into rigid-body fragments using structural chemistry inductive biases, then uses an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion model to learn reassembling these fragments within binding pockets.

Result: SigmaDock achieves Top-1 success rates (RMSD<2 & PB-valid) above 79.9% on the PoseBusters set, significantly outperforming recent deep learning approaches (12.7-30.8%) and becoming the first deep learning method to surpass classical physics-based docking under the PB train-test split.

Conclusion: SigmaDock represents a significant leap forward in the reliability and feasibility of deep learning for molecular modeling, demonstrating consistent generalization to unseen proteins while avoiding complex diffusion processes and unstable training dynamics.

Abstract: Determining the binding pose of a ligand to a protein, known as molecular
docking, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Generative approaches promise
faster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods,
but are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor
generalisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from
structural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments. Building
on this decomposition, we present SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion
model that generates poses by learning to reassemble these rigid bodies within
the binding pocket. By operating at the level of fragments in SE(3), SigmaDock
exploits well-established geometric priors while avoiding overly complex
diffusion processes and unstable training dynamics. Experimentally, we show
SigmaDock achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching Top-1 success rates
(RMSD<2 & PB-valid) above 79.9% on the PoseBusters set, compared to 12.7-30.8%
reported by recent deep learning approaches, whilst demonstrating consistent
generalisation to unseen proteins. SigmaDock is the first deep learning
approach to surpass classical physics-based docking under the PB train-test
split, marking a significant leap forward in the reliability and feasibility of
deep learning for molecular modelling.

*Paula Rodriguez-Diaz,Kirk Bansak Elisabeth Paulson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dual-Guided Loss (DGL) is a scalable method for decision-focused learning that uses dual variables from optimization problems to train models with fewer solver calls while maintaining decision alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current decision-focused learning methods require frequent and expensive calls to combinatorial optimizers, making scaling difficult. There's a need for methods that reduce solver dependence while preserving decision quality.

Method: Leverages dual variables from downstream optimization problems to shape learning. Decouples optimization from gradient updates by solving the downstream problem only periodically, and trains on dual-adjusted targets using simple differentiable surrogate losses between refreshes.

Result: DGL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art DFL methods while using far fewer solver calls and substantially less training time. It has asymptotically diminishing decision regret and drives training cost toward standard supervised learning as refreshes become less frequent.

Conclusion: DGL provides a simple, scalable approach to decision-focused learning that reduces solver dependence while maintaining strong decision alignment, making it practical for real-world applications with combinatorial optimization problems.

Abstract: Many real-world decisions are made under uncertainty by solving optimization
problems using predicted quantities. This predict-then-optimize paradigm has
motivated decision-focused learning, which trains models with awareness of how
the optimizer uses predictions, improving the performance of downstream
decisions. Despite its promise, scaling is challenging: state-of-the-art
methods either differentiate through a solver or rely on task-specific
surrogates, both of which require frequent and expensive calls to an optimizer,
often a combinatorial one. In this paper, we leverage dual variables from the
downstream problem to shape learning and introduce Dual-Guided Loss (DGL), a
simple, scalable objective that preserves decision alignment while reducing
solver dependence. We construct DGL specifically for combinatorial selection
problems with natural one-of-many constraints, such as matching, knapsack, and
shortest path. Our approach (a) decouples optimization from gradient updates by
solving the downstream problem only periodically; (b) between refreshes, trains
on dual-adjusted targets using simple differentiable surrogate losses; and (c)
as refreshes become less frequent, drives training cost toward standard
supervised learning while retaining strong decision alignment. We prove that
DGL has asymptotically diminishing decision regret, analyze runtime complexity,
and show on two problem classes that DGL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art
DFL methods while using far fewer solver calls and substantially less training
time. Code is available at https://github.com/paularodr/Dual-Guided-Learning.

Motivation: To overcome instability issues in continuous control reinforcement learning and reduce qubit requirements for quantum models while retaining strong expressiveness.

Method: Combine exponential-family priors over visible units with quantum Boltzmann distributions over hidden units, enabling analytical gradient computation for continuous variables and integration into Actor-Critic algorithms.

Result: Proposed a continuous Q-learning framework that replaces global maximization with efficient sampling from CSQBM distribution, addressing instability in continuous control.

Conclusion: CSQBMs provide a theoretically grounded hybrid quantum-classical approach for continuous reinforcement learning with reduced qubit requirements and improved stability.

Abstract: We introduce theoretically grounded Continuous Semi-Quantum Boltzmann
Machines (CSQBMs) that supports continuous-action reinforcement learning. By
combining exponential-family priors over visible units with quantum Boltzmann
distributions over hidden units, CSQBMs yield a hybrid quantum-classical model
that reduces qubit requirements while retaining strong expressiveness.
Crucially, gradients with respect to continuous variables can be computed
analytically, enabling direct integration into Actor-Critic algorithms.
Building on this, we propose a continuous Q-learning framework that replaces
global maximization by efficient sampling from the CSQBM distribution, thereby
overcoming instability issues in continuous control.

TL;DR: FoodRL is a reinforcement learning-based metalearning framework that clusters and dynamically weights forecasting models to improve accuracy for food bank donation predictions, especially during disruptions like hurricanes and wildfires.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food banks need accurate forecasting of volatile in-kind donations for equitable resource distribution, but traditional models fail due to unpredictable fluctuations and concept drift from seasonal variations and natural disasters.

Method: Proposed FoodRL, a novel RL-based metalearning framework that clusters and dynamically weights diverse forecasting models based on recent performance and contextual information.

Result: FoodRL consistently outperforms baseline methods, particularly during disruption periods, and can facilitate redistribution of food equivalent to 1.7 million additional meals annually.

Conclusion: FoodRL demonstrates significant potential for social impact and adaptive ensemble learning in humanitarian supply chains by providing more reliable and adaptive forecasts.

Abstract: Food banks are crucial for alleviating food insecurity, but their
effectiveness hinges on accurately forecasting highly volatile in-kind
donations to ensure equitable and efficient resource distribution. Traditional
forecasting models often fail to maintain consistent accuracy due to
unpredictable fluctuations and concept drift driven by seasonal variations and
natural disasters such as hurricanes in the Southeastern U.S. and wildfires in
the West Coast. To address these challenges, we propose FoodRL, a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) based metalearning framework that clusters and
dynamically weights diverse forecasting models based on recent performance and
contextual information. Evaluated on multi-year data from two structurally
distinct U.S. food banks-one large regional West Coast food bank affected by
wildfires and another state-level East Coast food bank consistently impacted by
hurricanes, FoodRL consistently outperforms baseline methods, particularly
during periods of disruption or decline. By delivering more reliable and
adaptive forecasts, FoodRL can facilitate the redistribution of food equivalent
to 1.7 million additional meals annually, demonstrating its significant
potential for social impact as well as adaptive ensemble learning for
humanitarian supply chains.

*Di Chen,Jia Li,Michael Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-interested autonomous vehicles can achieve collective rationality in mixed autonomy traffic through deep reinforcement learning, enabling cooperation without system-level objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether self-interested autonomous vehicles can benefit all agents in mixed autonomy traffic systems, given that prior research focused on system-level goals but real-world agents act out of self-interest.

Method: Used deep reinforcement learning with simple reward design to train self-interested traffic agents, examining collective rationality emergence in various scenarios without direct system-level objectives.

Result: Collective rationality consistently emerges across different scenarios, demonstrating robustness. A mechanism explaining CR emergence in microscopic dynamic environments was postulated and verified through simulation evidence.

Conclusion: Advanced learning methods like federated learning could potentially achieve collective cooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy systems.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be commercially available in the
near future, leading to mixed autonomy traffic consisting of both AVs and
human-driven vehicles (HVs). Although numerous studies have shown that AVs can
be deployed to benefit the overall traffic system performance by incorporating
system-level goals into their decision making, it is not clear whether the
benefits still exist when agents act out of self-interest -- a trait common to
all driving agents, both human and autonomous. This study aims to understand
whether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed
autonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective
rationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral
economics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when
pursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of
CR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed
human-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained
among driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a
simple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic
agents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives.
Results show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates
the robustness of this property. We also postulate a mechanism to explain the
emergence of CR in the microscopic and dynamic environment and verify it based
on simulation evidence. This research suggests the possibility of leveraging
advanced learning methods (such as federated learning) to achieve collective
cooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy systems.

TL;DR: Craftax-MA and Craftax-Coop are new multi-agent reinforcement learning benchmarks that address limitations of existing benchmarks by providing long-horizon challenges, evaluating generalization capabilities, and requiring complex cooperation among heterogeneous agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL benchmarks are too narrow and short-horizon, failing to adequately stress long-term dependencies and generalization capabilities inherent in multi-agent systems.

Method: Extended the popular Craftax environment to support multiple agents (Craftax-MA) and created Craftax-Coop with heterogeneous agents, trading mechanics, and complex cooperation requirements. Both are implemented in JAX for exceptional speed.

Result: Training runs with 250 million environment interactions complete in under an hour. Analysis shows existing algorithms struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, exploration, and cooperation in these benchmarks.

Conclusion: These benchmarks provide compelling challenges that can drive long-term research in MARL by addressing key limitations of current evaluation methods.

Abstract: Progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires challenging
benchmarks that assess the limits of current methods. However, existing
benchmarks often target narrow short-horizon challenges that do not adequately
stress the long-term dependencies and generalization capabilities inherent in
many multi-agent systems. To address this, we first present
\textit{Craftax-MA}: an extension of the popular open-ended RL environment,
Craftax, that supports multiple agents and evaluates a wide range of general
abilities within a single environment. Written in JAX, \textit{Craftax-MA} is
exceptionally fast with a training run using 250 million environment
interactions completing in under an hour. To provide a more compelling
challenge for MARL, we also present \textit{Craftax-Coop}, an extension
introducing heterogeneous agents, trading and more mechanics that require
complex cooperation among agents for success. We provide analysis demonstrating
that existing algorithms struggle with key challenges in this benchmark,
including long-horizon credit assignment, exploration and cooperation, and
argue for its potential to drive long-term research in MARL.

TL;DR: BiPETE - a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder for disease risk prediction using EHR data, combining rotary and sinusoidal positional embeddings to handle irregular visit timing and order, achieving significant performance improvements for alcohol and substance use disorder prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models show promise for EHR-based disease prediction but struggle with temporal dependencies due to irregular visit intervals and lack of uniform structure in electronic health records.

Method: Proposed BiPETE model integrates rotary positional embeddings for relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings for visit order preservation, trained on mental health EHR data for alcohol and substance use disorder prediction without large-scale pretraining.

Result: BiPETE outperforms baseline models with 34% and 50% improvement in AUPRC for depression and PTSD cohorts respectively. Integrated Gradients identified key clinical features including abnormal inflammatory, hematologic, metabolic markers, medications, and comorbidities.

Conclusion: The study presents a practical and interpretable framework for EHR-based disease risk prediction that achieves strong performance and provides deeper understanding of risk assessment through identified clinical features.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have shown promise for disease risk
prediction using electronic health records(EHRs), but modeling temporal
dependencies remains a key challenge due to irregular visit intervals and lack
of uniform structure. We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder
or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional
embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to
preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is
trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and
substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving
the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the
depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms
the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the
Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key
clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal
inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific
medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified
by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk
assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In
summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease
risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance.

TL;DR: This paper introduces swap multicalibration for elicitable properties and provides an oracle-efficient algorithm achieving improved error bounds, resolving an open question about achieving √T ℓ₂-mean multicalibration error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize multicalibration from group membership functions to arbitrary bounded hypothesis classes and strengthen the notion to swap multicalibration, addressing inefficiency in previous algorithms.

Method: Proposed an oracle-efficient algorithm using online agnostic learning that achieves T^{1/(r+1)} ℓ_r-swap multicalibration error for hypothesis classes with bounded sequential Rademacher complexity and elicitable properties.

Result: For r=2, achieved T^{1/3} ℓ₂-swap multicalibration error, significantly improving previous bounds and affirmatively resolving the open question about oracle-efficient √T ℓ₂-mean multicalibration.

Conclusion: The paper successfully generalizes multicalibration to arbitrary hypothesis classes and provides efficient algorithms with improved error bounds, completely resolving key open problems in the field.

Abstract: Multicalibration [HJKRR18] is an algorithmic fairness perspective that
demands that the predictions of a predictor are correct conditional on
themselves and membership in a collection of potentially overlapping subgroups
of a population. The work of [NR23] established a surprising connection between
multicalibration for an arbitrary property $\Gamma$ (e.g., mean or median) and
property elicitation: a property $\Gamma$ can be multicalibrated if and only if
it is elicitable, where elicitability is the notion that the true property
value of a distribution can be obtained by solving a regression problem over
the distribution. In the online setting, [NR23] proposed an inefficient
algorithm that achieves $\sqrt T$ $\ell_2$-multicalibration error for a
hypothesis class of group membership functions and an elicitable property
$\Gamma$, after $T$ rounds of interaction between a forecaster and adversary.
  In this paper, we generalize multicalibration for an elicitable property
$\Gamma$ from group membership functions to arbitrary bounded hypothesis
classes and introduce a stronger notion -- swap multicalibration, following
[GKR23]. Subsequently, we propose an oracle-efficient algorithm which, when
given access to an online agnostic learner, achieves $T^{1/(r+1)}$
$\ell_r$-swap multicalibration error with high probability (for $r\ge2$) for a
hypothesis class with bounded sequential Rademacher complexity and an
elicitable property $\Gamma$. For the special case of $r=2$, this implies an
oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $T^{1/3}$ $\ell_2$-swap
multicalibration error, which significantly improves on the previously
established bounds for the problem [NR23, GMS25, LSS25a], and completely
resolves an open question raised in [GJRR24] on the possibility of an
oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $\sqrt{T}$ $\ell_2$-mean
multicalibration error by answering it in a strongly affirmative sense.

### [99] [Multi-agent Coordination via Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05005)
*Dongsu Lee,Daehee Lee,Amy Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAC-Flow is a framework that balances rich multi-agent coordination representation with fast execution by learning flow-based joint behaviors and distilling them into decentralized one-step policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between rich coordination representation (slow diffusion methods) and fast execution (brittle Gaussian policies) in multi-agent systems.

Method: First learns flow-based representation of joint behaviors from offline data, then distills it into decentralized one-step policies for fast execution while preserving coordination.

Result: Achieves ~14.5x faster inference than diffusion-based methods while maintaining performance, with inference speed similar to Gaussian policy methods across 12 environments and 34 datasets.

Conclusion: MAC-Flow successfully alleviates the performance vs. computational cost trade-off in multi-agent coordination, providing both expressive coordination modeling and efficient real-time execution.

Abstract: This work presents MAC-Flow, a simple yet expressive framework for
multi-agent coordination. We argue that requirements of effective coordination
are twofold: (i) a rich representation of the diverse joint behaviors present
in offline data and (ii) the ability to act efficiently in real time. However,
prior approaches often sacrifice one for the other, i.e., denoising
diffusion-based solutions capture complex coordination but are computationally
slow, while Gaussian policy-based solutions are fast but brittle in handling
multi-agent interaction. MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a
flow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into
decentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast
execution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and
$34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and
computational cost, specifically achieving about $\boldsymbol{\times14.5}$
faster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining
good performance. At the same time, its inference speed is similar to that of
prior Gaussian policy-based offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
methods.

### [100] [OvA-LP: A Simple and Efficient Framework for Federated Learning on Non-IID Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05028)
*Dongjin Park,Hasung Yeo,Joon-Woo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OvA-LP is a minimalist framework that suppresses local drift in federated fine-tuning by combining linear probing on frozen encoders with one-vs-all heads and a two-stage procedure, achieving significantly better performance under extreme non-IID conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated fine-tuning is fragile under heterogeneous client distributions due to local drift, which causes systematic bias and amplified variance in the global model. Existing methods that correct drift post hoc are brittle under extreme non-IID conditions.

Method: OvA-LP combines linear probing on a frozen encoder with a one-vs-all head and a simple two-stage procedure. It preserves pretrained feature geometry and decouples logits to prevent mechanisms that amplify drift.

Result: On CIFAR-100 with 100 clients, OvA-LP retains 95.9% of its IID accuracy across different partitions, while state-of-the-art baselines retain only 10.1% (PFPT) and 34.5% (FFT-MoE). It also maintains resilience under symmetric and asymmetric label noise, with precomputed encoder features making per-round cost nearly independent of encoder size.

Conclusion: OvA-LP provides a principled and efficient basis for robust federated fine-tuning under heterogeneity by suppressing drift at its source rather than correcting it post hoc.

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FFT) adapts foundation models to decentralized data
but remains fragile under heterogeneous client distributions due to local
drift, i.e., client-level update divergences that induce systematic bias and
amplified variance in the global model. Existing aggregation and
personalization methods largely correct drift post hoc, which proves brittle
under extreme non-IID conditions. We introduce OvA-LP, a minimalist framework
that is, to our knowledge, the first explicitly designed to suppress drift at
its source within the PEFT-based FFT paradigm. OvA-LP combines linear probing
on a frozen encoder with a one-vs-all head and a simple two-stage procedure,
preserving pretrained feature geometry and decoupling logits to prevent the
mechanisms that amplify drift. On CIFAR-100 with 100 clients, averaged over
shard-1, shard-2, and Bernoulli-Dirichlet partitions, OvA-LP retains 95.9% of
its IID accuracy, whereas state-of-the-art FFT baselines retain only 10.1%
(PFPT) and 34.5% (FFT-MoE) under the same conditions. OvA-LP further maintains
resilience under both symmetric and asymmetric label noise. In addition,
precomputing encoder features makes per-round cost nearly independent of
encoder size. Together, these results demonstrate that OvA-LP provides a
principled and efficient basis for robust FFT under heterogeneity.

*Hadi Reisizadeh,Jiajun Ruan,Yiwei Chen,Soumyadeep Pal,Sijia Liu,Mingyi Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current LLM unlearning methods fail to achieve true forgetting - sensitive information reliably resurfaces under probabilistic decoding, revealing that standard evaluations underestimate knowledge leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlearning is critical for regulatory compliance and ethical AI to remove private, toxic, illegal, or copyrighted content from LLMs, but existing methods are unreliable.

Method: Introduces leak@k metric to quantify forgotten knowledge reappearing when generating k samples under realistic probabilistic decoding, and conducts systematic study across TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP benchmarks.

Result: Knowledge leakage persists across all tested unlearning methods and tasks, showing current techniques provide only limited forgetting despite appearing successful in deterministic decoding evaluations.

Conclusion: Current state-of-the-art unlearning techniques are insufficient, highlighting urgent need for more robust approaches to achieve reliable knowledge removal in LLMs.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is critical for regulatory
compliance and for building ethical generative AI systems that avoid producing
private, toxic, illegal, or copyrighted content. Despite rapid progress, in
this work we show that \textit{almost all} existing unlearning methods fail to
achieve true forgetting in practice. Specifically, while evaluations of these
`unlearned' models under deterministic (greedy) decoding often suggest
successful knowledge removal using standard benchmarks (as has been done in the
literature), we show that sensitive information reliably resurfaces when models
are sampled with standard probabilistic decoding. To rigorously capture this
vulnerability, we introduce \texttt{leak@$k$}, a new meta-evaluation metric
that quantifies the likelihood of forgotten knowledge reappearing when
generating $k$ samples from the model under realistic decoding strategies.
Using three widely adopted benchmarks, TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP, we conduct the
first large-scale, systematic study of unlearning reliability using our newly
defined \texttt{leak@$k$} metric. Our findings demonstrate that knowledge
leakage persists across methods and tasks, underscoring that current
state-of-the-art unlearning techniques provide only limited forgetting and
highlighting the urgent need for more robust approaches to LLM unlearning.

*Zhankun Luo,Abolfazl Hashemi*

TL;DR: This paper analyzes EM algorithm for 2-component Mixed Linear Regression with unknown weights, characterizing cycloid trajectories and proving non-asymptotic convergence guarantees across different SNR regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work established EM convergence for 2MLR with known balanced weights, but theoretical behavior with fully unknown parameters remains unclear, especially regarding trajectory patterns and convergence order.

Method: Derived explicit EM update expressions for 2MLR with unknown mixing weights and regression parameters, analyzed structural properties and cycloid trajectories, and established recurrence relations for sub-optimality angles.

Result: Proved that in noiseless case, EM trajectory traces a cycloid; quantified trajectory deviations in high SNR; revealed linear convergence when estimate is nearly orthogonal to ground truth, quadratic when angle is small; established non-asymptotic convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: Provides a novel trajectory-based framework for analyzing EM in Mixed Linear Regression, establishing comprehensive convergence guarantees with arbitrary initialization at finite-sample level.

Abstract: This work investigates the structural properties, cycloid trajectories, and
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown mixing
weights and regression parameters. Recent studies have established global
convergence for 2MLR with known balanced weights and super-linear convergence
in noiseless and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. However, the
theoretical behavior of EM in the fully unknown setting remains unclear, with
its trajectory and convergence order not yet fully characterized. We derive
explicit EM update expressions for 2MLR with unknown mixing weights and
regression parameters across all SNR regimes and analyze their structural
properties and cycloid trajectories. In the noiseless case, we prove that the
trajectory of the regression parameters in EM iterations traces a cycloid by
establishing a recurrence relation for the sub-optimality angle, while in high
SNR regimes we quantify its discrepancy from the cycloid trajectory. The
trajectory-based analysis reveals the order of convergence: linear when the EM
estimate is nearly orthogonal to the ground truth, and quadratic when the angle
between the estimate and ground truth is small at the population level. Our
analysis establishes non-asymptotic guarantees by sharpening bounds on
statistical errors between finite-sample and population EM updates, relating
EM's statistical accuracy to the sub-optimality angle, and proving convergence
with arbitrary initialization at the finite-sample level. This work provides a
novel trajectory-based framework for analyzing EM in Mixed Linear Regression.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAR-TS is a fast autoregressive framework for multivariate time series generation using disentangled factorization and Transformer modeling over discrete latent tokens, enabling arbitrary-length generation with orders-of-magnitude speedup over diffusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based approaches for multivariate time series generation are slow and limited to fixed-length windows, creating a need for faster and more flexible generation methods.

Method: Decomposes time series into data-adaptive basis (static cross-channel correlations) and temporal coefficients, vector-quantizes coefficients into discrete tokens, and uses LLaMA-style autoregressive Transformer to model token sequences.

Result: Achieves orders-of-magnitude faster generation than Diffusion-TS while preserving cross-channel correlations and providing an interpretable latent space for high-quality time series synthesis.

Conclusion: FAR-TS provides a simple yet effective framework for fast, controllable generation of arbitrary-length multivariate time series with preserved correlations and interpretable latent representations.

Abstract: Generative models for multivariate time series are essential for data
augmentation, simulation, and privacy preservation, yet current
state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches are slow and limited to
fixed-length windows. We propose FAR-TS, a simple yet effective framework that
combines disentangled factorization with an autoregressive Transformer over a
discrete, quantized latent space to generate time series. Each time series is
decomposed into a data-adaptive basis that captures static cross-channel
correlations and temporal coefficients that are vector-quantized into discrete
tokens. A LLaMA-style autoregressive Transformer then models these token
sequences, enabling fast and controllable generation of sequences with
arbitrary length. Owing to its streamlined design, FAR-TS achieves
orders-of-magnitude faster generation than Diffusion-TS while preserving
cross-channel correlations and an interpretable latent space, enabling
high-quality and flexible time series synthesis.

Motivation: To provide a strong statistical justification for selecting appropriate loss functions in deep learning by connecting them to activation functions and Maximum Likelihood Estimation principles.

Method: Analyzes mathematical properties of common activation functions (linear, sigmoid, ReLU, softmax) and connects them to loss functions (MSE, MAE, Cross-Entropy) through Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Generalized Linear Models framework.

Result: Demonstrates that choosing specific loss functions is equivalent to assuming particular probability distributions for model outputs, establishing a direct statistical link between activation functions and loss functions.

Conclusion: The selection of loss functions in neural networks has strong statistical foundations through Maximum Likelihood Estimation, connecting activation functions to underlying probability distributions and extending the Generalized Linear Models framework to deep learning.

Abstract: The loss function used to train a neural network is strongly connected to its
output layer from a statistical point of view. This technical report analyzes
common activation functions for a neural network output layer, like linear,
sigmoid, ReLU, and softmax, detailing their mathematical properties and their
appropriate use cases. A strong statistical justification exists for the
selection of the suitable loss function for training a deep learning model.
This report connects common loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE),
Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and various Cross-Entropy losses to the statistical
principle of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Choosing a specific loss
function is equivalent to assuming a specific probability distribution for the
model output, highlighting the link between these functions and the Generalized
Linear Models (GLMs) that underlie network output layers. Additional scenarios
of practical interest are also considered, such as alternative output
encodings, constrained outputs, and distributions with heavy tails.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scalable ROC-SVM using incomplete U-statistics and low-rank kernel approximation for efficient AUC maximization with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original ROC-SVM has high computational cost (O(n²)) which limits its practical use, especially with class imbalance problems.

Method: Developed scalable ROC-SVM using incomplete U-statistics to reduce complexity, extended to nonlinear classification via low-rank kernel approximation in RKHS.

Result: Achieves comparable AUC performance to original ROC-SVM with drastically reduced training time on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient and scalable alternative to ROC-SVM while maintaining competitive AUC performance.

Abstract: The ROC-SVM, originally proposed by Rakotomamonjy, directly maximizes the
area under the ROC curve (AUC) and has become an attractive alternative of the
conventional binary classification under the presence of class imbalance.
However, its practical use is limited by high computational cost, as training
involves evaluating all $O(n^2)$. To overcome this limitation, we develop a
scalable variant of the ROC-SVM that leverages incomplete U-statistics, thereby
substantially reducing computational complexity. We further extend the
framework to nonlinear classification through a low-rank kernel approximation,
enabling efficient training in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Theoretical
analysis establishes an error bound that justifies the proposed approximation,
and empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves comparable AUC performance to the original ROC-SVM
with drastically reduced training time.

Conclusion: Sophisticated ML models can be feasibly employed in regulated financial environments using modern explainability techniques, with the proposed 5D framework providing a structured approach to evaluate performance-interpretability trade-offs.

Abstract: The financial industry faces a significant challenge modeling and risk
portfolios: balancing the predictability of advanced machine learning models,

Authors elaborate on the application of these frameworks on different models
and demonstrates the more complex models with better prediction powers could be
applied and reach the same level of the explainability, using SHAP and LIME.
Beyond the comparison and discussion of performances, this paper proposes a

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NatureLM, a bioacoustic foundation model, loses instruction-following flexibility after domain-specific fine-tuning. A simple model merging strategy with its base language model recovers these capabilities while maintaining domain expertise and significantly improves zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models like NatureLM show promise in bioacoustics but suffer from reduced instruction-following flexibility after domain-specific fine-tuning, particularly when handling complex prompts requesting multiple outputs.

Method: Applied a simple model merging strategy that interpolates NatureLM with its base language model to balance domain expertise and instruction-following capabilities.

Result: The merged model recovers instruction-following flexibility with minimal domain knowledge loss, and achieves over 200% relative improvement in zero-shot classification of unseen species, setting new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Model merging effectively addresses the trade-off between domain expertise and instruction-following flexibility in specialized foundation models, enabling both strong performance and enhanced generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Foundation models capable of generalizing across species and tasks represent
a promising new frontier in bioacoustics, with NatureLM being one of the most
prominent examples. While its domain-specific fine-tuning yields strong
performance on bioacoustic benchmarks, we observe that it also introduces
trade-offs in instruction-following flexibility. For instance, NatureLM
achieves high accuracy when prompted for either the common or scientific name
individually, but its accuracy drops significantly when both are requested in a
single prompt. We address this by applying a simple model merging strategy that
interpolates NatureLM with its base language model, recovering
instruction-following capabilities with minimal loss of domain expertise.
Finally, we show that the merged model exhibits markedly stronger zero-shot
generalization, achieving over a 200% relative improvement and setting a new
state-of-the-art in closed-set zero-shot classification of unseen species.

TL;DR: Progressive training method that scales model depth during training to reduce computational cost while maintaining performance, achieving ~80% compute savings on GPT2 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deeper models achieve higher accuracy but require higher computational cost, creating a need for efficient training strategies that maintain performance while reducing computation.

Method: Zero/one-layer progressive training that scales up model capacity during training, with insights on initialization of new layers, hyperparameter transfer, learning rate schedule, and timing of model expansion.

Result: Achieved ~80% compute savings on GPT2 models (equivalent to ~5x acceleration) while maintaining almost the same loss as fully trained 60-layer models with 7B parameters.

Conclusion: Progressive training provides an effective strategy for efficient large-scale model training by optimizing the tradeoff between computation and loss through depth expansion during training.

Abstract: Model depth is a double-edged sword in deep learning: deeper models achieve
higher accuracy but require higher computational cost. To efficiently train
models at scale, an effective strategy is the progressive training, which
scales up model capacity during training, hence significantly reducing
computation with little to none performance degradation. In this work, we study
the depth expansion of large models through the lens of optimization theory and
feature learning, offering insights on the initialization of new layers,
hyperparameter transfer, learning rate schedule, and timing of model expansion.
Specifically, we propose zero/one-layer progressive training for the optimal
tradeoff between computation and loss. For example, zero/one-layer progressive
training on GPT2 can save $\approx 80\%$ compute, or equivalently accelerate
$\approx 5\times$ while achieving almost the same loss, compared to to a fully
trained 60-layer model with 7B parameters.

TL;DR: This paper systematically studies how spatial sensor density and sampling frequency affect forecasting model performance in IoT environmental sensing, finding that STGNNs work best with sparse deployments while TSFMs excel at high frequencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IoT data filtering techniques overlook how sampling frequency and spatial coverage variations affect downstream forecasting model performance, particularly the interplay between these factors and different model architectures.

Method: Systematic benchmarking of forecasting models (VAR, GRU, Transformer, STGNNs, TSFMs) using real-world temperature data from wireless sensor networks under varying spatial node density and sampling intervals.

Result: STGNNs are effective with sparse deployments and moderate sampling rates, leveraging spatial correlations via graph structure. TSFMs perform well at high frequencies but degrade with reduced spatial coverage. Moirai TSFM outperforms all models by learning cross-sensor dependencies.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable insights for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems, with STGNNs recommended for sparse deployments and TSFMs for high-frequency scenarios.

Abstract: Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume
spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically
powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic
deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook
how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream
model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from
additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts.
This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different
forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a
systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural
networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs),
and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under
varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world
temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are
effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate,
leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for
limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies
but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced.
Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively
learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights
for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems. All

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most AI-driven approaches in structure-based drug design neglect endogenous protein interactions with peptides, leading to suboptimal molecule designs.

Method: E(3)-equivariant graph neural network diffusion model trained on large datasets, generating small molecules by referencing peptide binders and protein pocket environments, with partial diffusion process for optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in non-autoregressive generative tasks, produces molecules similar to original peptide binders, and enables molecule optimization and peptidomimetic design.

Conclusion: Peptide2Mol is an effective deep generative model for generating and optimizing bioactive small molecules from protein binding pockets.

Abstract: Structure-based drug design has seen significant advancements with the
integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the generation of
hit and lead compounds. However, most AI-driven approaches neglect the
importance of endogenous protein interactions with peptides, which may result
in suboptimal molecule designs. In this work, we present Peptide2Mol, an
E(3)-equivariant graph neural network diffusion model that generates small
molecules by referencing both the original peptide binders and their
surrounding protein pocket environments. Trained on large datasets and
leveraging sophisticated modeling techniques, Peptide2Mol not only achieves
state-of-the-art performance in non-autoregressive generative tasks, but also
produces molecules with similarity to the original peptide binder.
Additionally, the model allows for molecule optimization and peptidomimetic
design through a partial diffusion process. Our results highlight Peptide2Mol
as an effective deep generative model for generating and optimizing bioactive
small molecules from protein binding pockets.

TL;DR: Proposes a hybrid framework combining structural break detection, wavelet denoising, and deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, TCN) for carbon price forecasting, achieving significant error reduction compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate carbon price forecasting is crucial for energy markets and decarbonization, but challenging due to structural breaks and noise from policy interventions. Existing methods treat denoising and modeling separately and lack systematic evaluation.

Method: Integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, PELT), wavelet signal denoising, and three deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, TCN) using EUA spot prices and exogenous features for univariate and multivariate analysis.

Result: PELT-WT-TCN achieved highest accuracy, reducing RMSE by 22.35% and MAE by 18.63% vs state-of-the-art baseline, and 70.55% RMSE and 74.42% MAE reduction vs original LSTM without decomposition.

Conclusion: Integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep learning significantly enhances accuracy and interpretability for carbon price forecasting and other nonstationary financial time series.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting carbon prices is essential for informed energy market
decision-making, guiding sustainable energy planning, and supporting effective
decarbonization strategies. However, it remains challenging due to structural
breaks and high-frequency noise caused by frequent policy interventions and
market shocks. Existing studies, including the most recent baseline approaches,
have attempted to incorporate breakpoints but often treat denoising and
modeling as separate processes and lack systematic evaluation across advanced
deep learning architectures, limiting the robustness and the generalization
capability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid
framework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and
PELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep
learning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot
prices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and
policy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate
datasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing
forecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the
state-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by
70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without
decomposition from the same baseline study. These findings underscore the value
of integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep
learning architectures to enhance accuracy and interpretability in carbon price
forecasting and other nonstationary financial time series.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning framework with Transformer encoder and Minimal Gated Unit decoder for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones (TSP-D), achieving competitive performance with faster training and computation times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Truck-drone collaborative systems in last-mile logistics face NP-hard combinatorial complexity that conventional optimization methods cannot efficiently solve, requiring advanced approaches like deep reinforcement learning for synchronized vehicle coordination.

Method: Hierarchical Actor-Critic deep RL framework with Transformer-inspired encoder using k-nearest neighbors sparse attention and global node features, combined with Minimal Gated Unit decoder for solution sequence generation, operating in asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior solutions on TSP-D instances (N=10 to 100) with shorter computation times compared to heuristic algorithms and existing RL methods, while significantly reducing total training time with superior final performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates notable advantages in training efficiency and computational performance for solving complex TSP-D problems, making it suitable for real-world logistics applications.

Abstract: The emergence of truck-drone collaborative systems in last-mile logistics has
positioned the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones (TSP-D) as a pivotal
extension of classical routing optimization, where synchronized vehicle
coordination promises substantial operational efficiency and reduced
environmental impact, yet introduces NP-hard combinatorial complexity beyond
the reach of conventional optimization paradigms. Deep reinforcement learning
offers a theoretically grounded framework to address TSP-D's inherent
challenges through self-supervised policy learning and adaptive
decision-making. This study proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep
reinforcement learning framework for solving the TSP-D problem. The
architecture consists of two primary components: a Transformer-inspired encoder
and an efficient Minimal Gated Unit decoder. The encoder incorporates a novel,
optimized k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism specifically for
focusing on relevant spatial relationships, further enhanced by the integration
of global node features. The Minimal Gated Unit decoder processes these encoded
representations to efficiently generate solution sequences. The entire
framework operates within an asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm.
Experimental results show that, on benchmark TSP-D instances of various scales
(N=10 to 100), the proposed model can obtain competitive or even superior
solutions in shorter average computation times compared to high-performance
heuristic algorithms and existing reinforcement learning methods. Moreover,
compared to advanced reinforcement learning algorithm benchmarks, the proposed
framework significantly reduces the total training time required while
achieving superior final performance, highlighting its notable advantage in
training efficiency.

TL;DR: Machine learning-enhanced localization framework using diffusion models improves data assimilation for CO2 injection in channelized reservoirs, maintaining ensemble variance while achieving good data matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity is crucial for safe and effective geological carbon storage projects, requiring improved data assimilation methods.

Method: Integrates score-based diffusion models with ML-enhanced localization using large ensembles (Ns=5000), applying ML algorithms to prior ensembles of channelized permeability fields generated with FLUVSIM geostatistical model, tested on CO2 injection scenario with DARTS simulator.

Result: ML-based localization maintains significantly more ensemble variance than without localization while achieving comparable data-matching quality.

Conclusion: The framework improves reliability of uncertainty quantification for risk assessment in geological carbon storage projects.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity is important for the
safe and effective implementation of geological carbon storage (GCS) projects.
This paper explores how machine learning methods can enhance data assimilation
for GCS with a framework that integrates score-based diffusion models with
machine learning-enhanced localization in channelized reservoirs during CO$_2$
injection. We employ a machine learning-enhanced localization framework that
uses large ensembles ($N_s = 5000$) with permeabilities generated by the
diffusion model and states computed by simple ML algorithms to improve
covariance estimation for the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation
(ESMDA). We apply ML algorithms to a prior ensemble of channelized permeability
fields, generated with the geostatistical model FLUVSIM. Our approach is
applied on a CO$_2$ injection scenario simulated using the Delft Advanced
Research Terra Simulator (DARTS). Our ML-based localization maintains
significantly more ensemble variance than when localization is not applied,
while achieving comparable data-matching quality. This framework has practical
implications for GCS projects, helping improve the reliability of uncertainty
quantification for risk assessment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuAnTS, a novel time series question-answering dataset focused on human motion data, addressing the gap in QA research for time series data compared to vision and text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text provides intuitive access to information that complements dense numerical time series, enabling better interactions with time series models for improved accessibility and decision-making. Current QA research heavily focuses on vision and text, with time series receiving minimal attention.

Method: Created a comprehensive time series QA dataset (QuAnTS) with diverse questions and answers about human motion using tracked skeleton trajectories. Conducted extensive experiments to verify dataset quality and evaluated existing and new baseline models.

Result: The QuAnTS dataset was validated as well-formed and comprehensive. Human performance benchmarks were established as reference points for practical usability assessment of TSQA models.

Conclusion: The work lays groundwork for deeper exploration of time series question answering and aims to encourage future research on text-based interactions with time series models to enable better decision-making and more transparent systems.

Abstract: Text offers intuitive access to information. This can, in particular,
complement the density of numerical time series, thereby allowing improved
interactions with time series models to enhance accessibility and
decision-making. While the creation of question-answering datasets and models
has recently seen remarkable growth, most research focuses on question
answering (QA) on vision and text, with time series receiving minute attention.
To bridge this gap, we propose a challenging novel time series QA (TSQA)
dataset, QuAnTS, for Question Answering on Time Series data. Specifically, we
pose a wide variety of questions and answers about human motion in the form of
tracked skeleton trajectories. We verify that the large-scale QuAnTS dataset is
well-formed and comprehensive through extensive experiments. Thoroughly
evaluating existing and newly proposed baselines then lays the groundwork for a
deeper exploration of TSQA using QuAnTS. Additionally, we provide human
performances as a key reference for gauging the practical usability of such
models. We hope to encourage future research on interacting with time series
models through text, enabling better decision-making and more transparent
systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Consecutive Preferential Bayesian Optimization reduces production costs by reusing previously generated candidates and incorporates perceptual ambiguity modeling to handle indifference feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preferential Bayesian optimization methods ignore the high costs of generating candidate solutions for evaluation, and don't account for human perceptual ambiguity when providing comparative feedback.

Method: Proposed Consecutive Preferential Bayesian Optimization that constrains comparisons to involve previously generated candidates to reduce production costs, and incorporates a Just-Noticeable Difference threshold into probabilistic preference model to capture indifference to small utility differences.

Result: Empirical results show notable increase in accuracy in setups with high production costs or with indifference feedback compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses both production cost and perceptual ambiguity challenges in preferential Bayesian optimization, leading to improved performance in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Preferential Bayesian optimization allows optimization of objectives that are
either expensive or difficult to measure directly, by relying on a minimal
number of comparative evaluations done by a human expert. Generating candidate
solutions for evaluation is also often expensive, but this cost is ignored by
existing methods. We generalize preference-based optimization to explicitly
account for production and evaluation costs with Consecutive Preferential
Bayesian Optimization, reducing production cost by constraining comparisons to
involve previously generated candidates. We also account for the perceptual
ambiguity of the oracle providing the feedback by incorporating a
Just-Noticeable Difference threshold into a probabilistic preference model to
capture indifference to small utility differences. We adapt an
information-theoretic acquisition strategy to this setting, selecting new
configurations that are most informative about the unknown optimum under a
preference model accounting for the perceptual ambiguity. We empirically
demonstrate a notable increase in accuracy in setups with high production costs
or with indifference feedback.

TL;DR: Multimodal deep learning combining SR-PET, CT, and laboratory biomarkers outperforms unimodal approaches for predicting progression-free survival after PRRT in metastatic neuroendocrine tumor patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRRT is effective for metastatic NETs but only provides long-term disease control in a subset of patients. Predicting PFS could enable individualized treatment planning and risk-adapted follow-up strategies.

Method: Retrospective study of 116 PRRT-treated patients using laboratory values, SR-PET, and CT imaging. Seven models were trained including unimodal (laboratory, SR-PET, CT) and multimodal fusion approaches with explainability analysis.

Result: Multimodal fusion model combining laboratory values, SR-PET, and CT achieved best performance (AUROC 0.72 ± 0.01, AUPRC 0.80 ± 0.01), outperforming unimodal models (laboratory AUROC 0.59, SR-PET AUROC 0.42, CT AUROC 0.54).

Conclusion: Multimodal deep learning combining imaging and laboratory data provides superior PFS prediction for PRRT patients and could support personalized treatment strategies after external validation.

Abstract: Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an established treatment for
metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), yet long-term disease control occurs
only in a subset of patients. Predicting progression-free survival (PFS) could
support individualized treatment planning. This study evaluates laboratory,
imaging, and multimodal deep learning models for PFS prediction in PRRT-treated
patients. In this retrospective, single-center study 116 patients with
metastatic NETs undergoing 177Lu-DOTATOC were included. Clinical
characteristics, laboratory values, and pretherapeutic somatostatin receptor
positron emission tomography/computed tomographies (SR-PET/CT) were collected.
Seven models were trained to classify low- vs. high-PFS groups, including
unimodal (laboratory, SR-PET, or CT) and multimodal fusion approaches.
Explainability was evaluated by feature importance analysis and gradient maps.
Forty-two patients (36%) had short PFS (< 1 year), 74 patients long PFS (>1
year). Groups were similar in most characteristics, except for higher baseline
chromogranin A (p = 0.003), elevated gamma-GT (p = 0.002), and fewer PRRT
cycles (p < 0.001) in short-PFS patients. The Random Forest model trained only
on laboratory biomarkers reached an AUROC of 0.59 +- 0.02. Unimodal
three-dimensional convolutional neural networks using SR-PET or CT performed
worse (AUROC 0.42 +- 0.03 and 0.54 +- 0.01, respectively). A multimodal fusion
model laboratory values, SR-PET, and CT -augmented with a pretrained CT branch
- achieved the best results (AUROC 0.72 +- 0.01, AUPRC 0.80 +- 0.01).
Multimodal deep learning combining SR-PET, CT, and laboratory biomarkers
outperformed unimodal approaches for PFS prediction after PRRT. Upon external
validation, such models may support risk-adapted follow-up strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies online off-dynamics reinforcement learning where training and deployment dynamics differ, introducing a novel supremal visitation ratio to measure this mismatch and proposing the first efficient algorithm with sublinear regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing off-dynamics RL literature assumes access to generative models or pre-collected datasets with good state coverage, bypassing exploration challenges. This work addresses the more realistic setting where agents can only interact online with the training environment.

Method: The authors introduce the supremal visitation ratio to quantify the mismatch between training and deployment dynamics, and propose a computationally efficient algorithm for online RMDPs with f-divergence based transition uncertainties.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves sublinear regret in online RMDPs, with matching regret lower bounds showing optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and number of interaction episodes. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first efficient algorithm for online off-dynamics RL with theoretical guarantees, addressing the fundamental challenge of exploration when training and deployment dynamics differ.

Abstract: Off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment
transition dynamics are different, can be formulated as learning in a robust
Markov decision process (RMDP) where uncertainties in transition dynamics are
imposed. Existing literature mostly assumes access to generative models
allowing arbitrary state-action queries or pre-collected datasets with a good
state coverage of the deployment environment, bypassing the challenge of
exploration. In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting
where the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment.
To capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we
introduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the
mismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show
that if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We
propose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear
regret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties. We
also establish matching regret lower bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm
achieves optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and the
number of interaction episodes. Finally, we validate our theoretical results
through comprehensive numerical experiments.

*Mathias Lundteigen Mohus,Jingyue Li,Zhirong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel data poisoning technique called associative poisoning that manipulates fine-grained features in generative models without requiring control over training, compromising statistical associations while maintaining output quality and evading detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing poisoning attacks either cause broad degradation or require training control, limiting real-world applicability. There's a need for more subtle attacks that can manipulate specific features without detection.

Method: Associative poisoning perturbs training data to manipulate statistical associations between specific feature pairs in generated outputs, with formal mathematical formulation proving theoretical feasibility and stealthiness.

Result: Empirical evaluations show the attack effectively induces or suppresses feature associations while preserving marginal distributions and maintaining high-quality outputs, evading visual detection.

Conclusion: Generative systems are susceptible to subtle statistical manipulations, requiring new defensive strategies beyond existing approaches.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative models such as Stable Diffusion and
ChatGPT has made them increasingly attractive targets for malicious
exploitation, particularly through data poisoning. Existing poisoning attacks
compromising synthesised data typically either cause broad degradation of
generated data or require control over the training process, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel data
poisoning technique called associative poisoning, which compromises
fine-grained features of the generated data without requiring control of the
training process. This attack perturbs only the training data to manipulate
statistical associations between specific feature pairs in the generated
outputs. We provide a formal mathematical formulation of the attack and prove
its theoretical feasibility and stealthiness. Empirical evaluations using two
state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that associative poisoning
effectively induces or suppresses feature associations while preserving the
marginal distributions of the targeted features and maintaining high-quality
outputs, thereby evading visual detection. These results suggest that
generative systems used in image synthesis, synthetic dataset generation, and
natural language processing are susceptible to subtle, stealthy manipulations
that compromise their statistical integrity. To address this risk, we examine
the limitations of existing defensive strategies and propose a novel
countermeasure strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI fault prediction models lack reliability in evolving smart grid environments where they need to adapt to new fault types and operational zones.

Method: ProDER (Prototype-based Dark Experience Replay) integrates prototype-based feature regularization, logit distillation, and prototype-guided replay memory in a unified replay-based continual learning approach.

Result: ProDER achieved best performance among tested CL techniques with only 0.045 accuracy drop for fault type prediction and 0.015 for fault zone prediction.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the practicality of continual learning for scalable, real-world fault prediction in smart grids.

Abstract: As smart grids evolve to meet growing energy demands and modern operational
challenges, the ability to accurately predict faults becomes increasingly
critical. However, existing AI-based fault prediction models struggle to ensure
reliability in evolving environments where they are required to adapt to new
fault types and operational zones. In this paper, we propose a continual
learning (CL) framework in the smart grid context to evolve the model together
with the environment. We design four realistic evaluation scenarios grounded in
class-incremental and domain-incremental learning to emulate evolving grid
conditions. We further introduce Prototype-based Dark Experience Replay
(ProDER), a unified replay-based approach that integrates prototype-based
feature regularization, logit distillation, and a prototype-guided replay
memory. ProDER achieves the best performance among tested CL techniques, with
only a 0.045 accuracy drop for fault type prediction and 0.015 for fault zone
prediction. These results demonstrate the practicality of CL for scalable,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current circuit discovery methods like Path Patching are computationally expensive and limit in-depth analysis for smaller models.

Method: APP uses Contrastive-FLAP pruning to reduce search space by 56% on average, then applies traditional Path Patching on remaining attention heads.

Result: APP achieves 59.63%-93.27% speedup compared to Path Patching on dense models, with circuits showing substantial overlap and similar performance to established Path Patching circuits.

Conclusion: APP provides substantial computational savings for circuit discovery while maintaining circuit quality and performance.

Abstract: Circuit discovery is a key step in many mechanistic interpretability
pipelines. Current methods, such as Path Patching, are computationally
expensive and have limited in-depth circuit analysis for smaller models. In
this study, we propose Accelerated Path Patching (APP), a hybrid approach
leveraging our novel contrastive attention head pruning method to drastically
reduce the search space of circuit discovery methods. Our Contrastive-FLAP
pruning algorithm uses techniques from causal mediation analysis to assign
higher pruning scores to task-specific attention heads, leading to higher
performing sparse models compared to traditional pruning techniques. Although
Contrastive-FLAP is successful at preserving task-specific heads that existing
pruning algorithms remove at low sparsity ratios, the circuits found by
Contrastive-FLAP alone are too large to satisfy the minimality constraint
required in circuit analysis. APP first applies Contrastive-FLAP to reduce the
search space on required for circuit discovery algorithms by, on average, 56\%.
Next, APP, applies traditional Path Patching on the remaining attention heads,
leading to a speed up of 59.63\%-93.27\% compared to Path Patching applied to
the dense model. Despite the substantial computational saving that APP
provides, circuits obtained from APP exhibit substantial overlap and similar
performance to previously established Path Patching circuits

Motivation: To reduce the high computational cost of neural network training, particularly the expensive backward pass required for full gradient computation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides deterministic, non-asymptotic bounds on KL divergence for flow-matching distribution approximation, showing statistical convergence rates and near-minimax optimal efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish rigorous statistical guarantees for flow-matching methods and compare their efficiency with diffusion models under Total Variation distance.

Method: Derive deterministic upper bounds on KL divergence based on L2 flow-matching loss bounds, analyze constants dependent on data and velocity field regularities, and conduct numerical studies.

Result: If L2 flow-matching loss is bounded by ε², then KL divergence is bounded by A₁ε + A₂ε², achieving nearly minimax-optimal efficiency for smooth distribution estimation.

Conclusion: Flow matching achieves statistical efficiency comparable to diffusion models under TV distance, with theoretical bounds supported by numerical validation.

Abstract: We derive a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation. In particular,
if the $L_2$ flow-matching loss is bounded by $\epsilon^2 > 0$, then the KL
divergence between the true data distribution and the estimated distribution is
bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$. Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$
depend only on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. Consequently,
this bound implies statistical convergence rates of Flow Matching Transformers
under the Total Variation (TV) distance. We show that, flow matching achieves
nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions. Our
results make the statistical efficiency of flow matching comparable to that of
diffusion models under the TV distance. Numerical studies on synthetic and
learned velocities corroborate our theory.

TL;DR: ActiTect is an automated, open-source machine learning tool that detects REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) from wrist-worn actigraphy data with high accuracy across multiple validation cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: iRBD is a major prodromal marker for α-synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease, but current actigraphy methods lack reliable automated analysis pipelines for large-scale screening.

Method: Developed a fully automated pipeline with robust preprocessing, sleep-wake detection, and physiologically interpretable motion features. Used machine learning on actigraphy data from 78 individuals with nested cross-validation.

Result: Achieved AUROC of 0.95 in development, 0.86 on local test set (n=31), and 0.84-0.94 on two external cohorts (n=113, n=57). Leave-one-dataset-out validation showed consistent performance (AUROC 0.84-0.89).

Conclusion: ActiTect provides a robust, generalizable RBD detection tool that is open-source and ready for broader deployment, facilitating collaborative improvements in wearable-based RBD screening.

Abstract: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a major
prodromal marker of $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, often preceding the clinical
onset of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system
atrophy. While wrist-worn actimeters hold significant potential for detecting
RBD in large-scale screening efforts by capturing abnormal nocturnal movements,
they become inoperable without a reliable and efficient analysis pipeline. This
study presents ActiTect, a fully automated, open-source machine learning tool
to identify RBD from actigraphy recordings. To ensure generalizability across
heterogeneous acquisition settings, our pipeline includes robust preprocessing
and automated sleep-wake detection to harmonize multi-device data and extract
physiologically interpretable motion features characterizing activity patterns.
Model development was conducted on a cohort of 78 individuals, yielding strong
discrimination under nested cross-validation (AUROC = 0.95). Generalization was
confirmed on a blinded local test set (n = 31, AUROC = 0.86) and on two
independent external cohorts (n = 113, AUROC = 0.84; n = 57, AUROC = 0.94). To
assess real-world robustness, leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation across the
internal and external cohorts demonstrated consistent performance (AUROC range
= 0.84-0.89). A complementary stability analysis showed that key predictive
features remained reproducible across datasets, supporting the final pooled
multi-center model as a robust pre-trained resource for broader deployment. By
being open-source and easy to use, our tool promotes widespread adoption and
facilitates independent validation and collaborative improvements, thereby
advancing the field toward a unified and generalizable RBD detection model
using wearable devices.

TL;DR: DGTN is a novel deep learning architecture that uses bidirectional diffusion to co-learn structural and sequential protein representations, achieving state-of-the-art performance in predicting mutation effects on enzyme stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches process protein sequence and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns, which is crucial for accurate prediction of mutation effects on enzyme thermodynamic stability.

Method: DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network) uses a bidirectional diffusion process where GNN-derived structural embeddings guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and transformer representations refine GNN message passing through attention-modulated graph updates.

Result: On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves state-of-the-art performance with Pearson Rho = 0.87 and RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol, showing 6.2% improvement over best baselines. The diffusion mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation.

Conclusion: The work establishes a principled framework for integrating heterogeneous protein representations through learnable diffusion, with theoretical analysis proving the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T)).

Abstract: Predicting the effect of amino acid mutations on enzyme thermodynamic
stability (DDG) is fundamental to protein engineering and drug design. While
recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often process sequence
and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate
coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns. We
present DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that
co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and
transformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a
bidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings
guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2)
transformer representations refine GNN message passing through
attention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis
showing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds
than independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves
state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with
6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion
mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation. Our theoretical analysis
proves the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling,
with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) ) where T is diffusion steps. This work
establishes a principled framework for integrating heterogeneous protein
representations through learnable diffusion.

### [128] [The Causal Round Trip: Generating Authentic Counterfactuals by Eliminating Information Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05236)
*Rui Wu,Lizheng Wang,Yongjun Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BELM-MDCM is a diffusion-based framework that eliminates Structural Reconstruction Error (SRE) through analytically invertible mechanisms, enabling faithful counterfactual reasoning by preserving causal information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models suffer from Structural Reconstruction Error (SRE) due to information loss, which prevents faithful abduction required for counterfactual reasoning in Structural Causal Models.

Method: Introduces BELM-MDCM framework with Causal Information Conservation (CIC) principle, analytically invertible mechanisms, Targeted Modeling for structural regularization, and Hybrid Training Objective for causal inductive bias.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and enables high-fidelity, individual-level counterfactuals required for deep causal inquiries, with zero SRE by construction.

Conclusion: Provides a foundational blueprint that reconciles modern generative models with classical causal theory, establishing a new rigorous standard for causal inference.

Abstract: Judea Pearl's vision of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as engines for
counterfactual reasoning hinges on faithful abduction: the precise inference of
latent exogenous noise. For decades, operationalizing this step for complex,
non-linear mechanisms has remained a significant computational challenge. The
advent of diffusion models, powerful universal function approximators, offers a
promising solution. However, we argue that their standard design, optimized for
perceptual generation over logical inference, introduces a fundamental flaw for
this classical problem: an inherent information loss we term the Structural
Reconstruction Error (SRE). To address this challenge, we formalize the
principle of Causal Information Conservation (CIC) as the necessary condition
for faithful abduction. We then introduce BELM-MDCM, the first diffusion-based
framework engineered to be causally sound by eliminating SRE by construction
through an analytically invertible mechanism. To operationalize this framework,
a Targeted Modeling strategy provides structural regularization, while a Hybrid
Training Objective instills a strong causal inductive bias. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our Zero-SRE framework not only achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but, more importantly, enables the high-fidelity,
individual-level counterfactuals required for deep causal inquiries. Our work
provides a foundational blueprint that reconciles the power of modern
generative models with the rigor of classical causal theory, establishing a new
and more rigorous standard for this emerging field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data augmentation methods like ZOO-PCA can reduce membership inference attack effectiveness on time series forecasting models while maintaining predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to balance privacy protection against membership inference attacks with maintaining high predictive accuracy in time series forecasting of electronic health records.

Method: Used data augmentation strategies including Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), ZOO-PCA (constrained by PCA), and MixUp to generate synthetic training data that confuses attackers while preserving model generalization.

Result: ZOO-PCA achieved the best reduction in true-positive to false-positive ratio for membership inference attacks without sacrificing test performance.

Conclusion: Data augmentation, particularly ZOO-PCA, effectively enhances privacy protection against membership inference attacks in time series forecasting while maintaining model accuracy.

Abstract: Balancing strong privacy guarantees with high predictive performance is
critical for time series forecasting (TSF) tasks involving Electronic Health
Records (EHR). In this study, we explore how data augmentation can mitigate
Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on TSF models. We show that retraining with
synthetic data can substantially reduce the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by
reducing the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio. The key
challenge is generating synthetic samples that closely resemble the original
training data to confuse the attacker, while also introducing enough novelty to
enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We examine multiple
augmentation strategies - Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a variant of ZOO
constrained by Principal Component Analysis (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp - to
strengthen model resilience without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental
results show that ZOO-PCA yields the best reductions in TPR/FPR ratio for MIA
attacks without sacrificing performance on test data.

### [130] [Attention and Compression is all you need for Controllably Efficient Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05313)
*Jatin Prakash,Aahlad Puli,Rajesh Ranganath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAT (Compress & Attend Transformer) is an efficient transformer architecture that uses dense attention on compressed sequence chunks to achieve better quality-compute trade-offs than existing efficient approaches, with the ability to adapt chunk sizes at test-time without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the quadratic cost of attention in transformers while avoiding the quality-compute trade-off limitations of existing efficient approaches like sparse attention, sliding windows, and convolutions, which often sacrifice in-context recall performance.

Method: Uses two simple components: dense attention and compression. Decodes chunks of tokens by attending to compressed chunks of previous sequences, allowing control over quality-compute trade-offs through chunk size selection. Can be trained with multiple chunk sizes simultaneously.

Result: Outperforms existing efficient baselines across different compute-memory budgets, matches dense transformer in language modeling while being 1.4-3x faster and requiring 2-9x lower total memory usage.

Conclusion: CAT provides a simple yet effective approach to efficient transformers that maintains quality while offering significant speed and memory improvements, with the unique advantage of adaptive quality-compute trade-off control at test-time.

Abstract: The quadratic cost of attention in transformers motivated the development of
efficient approaches: namely sparse and sliding window attention, convolutions
and linear attention. Although these approaches result in impressive reductions
in compute and memory, they often trade-off with quality, specifically
in-context recall performance. Moreover, apriori fixing this quality-compute
tradeoff means being suboptimal from the get-go: some downstream applications
require more memory for in-context recall, while others require lower latency
and memory. Further, these approaches rely on heuristic choices that
artificially restrict attention, or require handcrafted and complex recurrent
state update rules, or they must be carefully composed with attention at
specific layers to form a hybrid architecture that complicates the design
process, especially at scale. To address above issues, we propose Compress &
Attend Transformer (CAT), a conceptually simple architecture employing two
simple ingredients only: dense attention and compression. CAT decodes chunks of
tokens by attending to compressed chunks of the sequence so far. Compression
results in decoding from a reduced sequence length that yields compute and
memory savings, while choosing a particular chunk size trades-off quality for
efficiency. Moreover, CAT can be trained with multiple chunk sizes at once,
unlocking control of quality-compute trade-offs directly at test-time without
any retraining, all in a single adaptive architecture. In exhaustive
evaluations on common language modeling tasks, in-context recall, and
long-context understanding, a single adaptive CAT model outperforms existing
efficient baselines, including hybrid architectures, across different
compute-memory budgets. Further, a single CAT matches dense transformer in
language modeling across model scales while being 1.4-3x faster and requiring
2-9x lower total memory usage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes rendering product text metadata directly onto images to improve multimodal retrieval by strengthening image-text alignment, countering typographic attack vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models like CLIP are vulnerable to typographic attacks where misleading text in images skews predictions, which affects e-commerce product retrieval systems.

Method: Renders relevant textual content (titles, descriptions) directly onto product images to perform vision-text compression, strengthening image-text alignment.

Result: Consistent improvements in unimodal and multimodal retrieval accuracy across three e-commerce datasets (sneakers, handbags, trading cards) using six vision foundation models.

Conclusion: Visually rendering product metadata is a simple yet effective enhancement for zero-shot multimodal retrieval in e-commerce applications.

Abstract: Multimodal product retrieval systems in e-commerce platforms rely on
effectively combining visual and textual signals to improve search relevance
and user experience. However, vision-language models such as CLIP are
vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading or irrelevant text embedded
in images skews model predictions. In this work, we propose a novel method that
reverses the logic of typographic attacks by rendering relevant textual content
(e.g., titles, descriptions) directly onto product images to perform
vision-text compression, thereby strengthening image-text alignment and
boosting multimodal product retrieval performance. We evaluate our method on
three vertical-specific e-commerce datasets (sneakers, handbags, and trading
cards) using six state-of-the-art vision foundation models. Our experiments
demonstrate consistent improvements in unimodal and multimodal retrieval
accuracy across categories and model families. Our findings suggest that
visually rendering product metadata is a simple yet effective enhancement for
zero-shot multimodal retrieval in e-commerce applications.

*Jan-Hendrik Ewering,Robin E. Herrmann,Niklas Wahlström,Thomas B. Schön,Thomas Seel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Bayesian method for learning non-conservative Hamiltonian dynamics from input-output data using Gaussian Process regression, without requiring velocity/momentum measurements that are typically unavailable in practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To construct physically consistent models from limited data by embedding energy conservation laws, addressing the practical limitation that velocity/momentum data is rarely available in real applications.

Method: Uses non-conservative Hamiltonian Gaussian Processes with a fully Bayesian scheme for estimating hidden states, GP hyperparameters, and structural parameters. Employs reduced-rank GP approximation for computational efficiency.

Result: The method is evaluated in a nonlinear simulation case study and shows comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches that require momentum measurements.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables physically consistent dynamics learning from practical input-output data without requiring hard-to-obtain velocity/momentum measurements, while maintaining computational efficiency through reduced-rank approximations.

Abstract: Embedding non-restrictive prior knowledge, such as energy conservation laws,
in learning-based approaches is a key motive to construct physically consistent
models from limited data, relevant for, e.g., model-based control. Recent work
incorporates Hamiltonian dynamics into Gaussian Process (GP) regression to
obtain uncertainty-quantifying models that adhere to the underlying physical
principles. However, these works rely on velocity or momentum data, which is
rarely available in practice. In this paper, we consider dynamics learning with
non-conservative Hamiltonian GPs, and address the more realistic problem
setting of learning from input-output data. We provide a fully Bayesian scheme
for estimating probability densities of unknown hidden states, of GP
hyperparameters, as well as of structural hyperparameters, such as damping
coefficients. Considering the computational complexity of GPs, we take
advantage of a reduced-rank GP approximation and leverage its properties for
computationally efficient prediction and training. The proposed method is
evaluated in a nonlinear simulation case study and compared to a
state-of-the-art approach that relies on momentum measurements.

TL;DR: SAD-Flower is a novel flow matching framework that generates safe, admissible, and dynamically consistent trajectories by augmenting flows with virtual control inputs, providing formal guarantees without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow matching methods lack formal guarantees for state/action constraints and dynamic consistency, which are crucial for safety and executability of planned trajectories.

Method: Augments flow with virtual control input and uses nonlinear control theory techniques to derive principled guidance, enabling formal guarantees for constraints and dynamic consistency without retraining.

Result: Outperforms various generative-model-based baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: SAD-Flower provides a framework for generating safe, admissible, and dynamically consistent trajectories with formal guarantees, addressing key limitations of existing flow matching planners.

Abstract: Flow matching (FM) has shown promising results in data-driven planning.
However, it inherently lacks formal guarantees for ensuring state and action
constraints, whose satisfaction is a fundamental and crucial requirement for
the safety and admissibility of planned trajectories on various systems.
Moreover, existing FM planners do not ensure the dynamical consistency, which
potentially renders trajectories inexecutable. We address these shortcomings by
proposing SAD-Flower, a novel framework for generating Safe, Admissible, and
Dynamically consistent trajectories. Our approach relies on an augmentation of
the flow with a virtual control input. Thereby, principled guidance can be
derived using techniques from nonlinear control theory, providing formal
guarantees for state constraints, action constraints, and dynamic consistency.
Crucially, SAD-Flower operates without retraining, enabling test-time
satisfaction of unseen constraints. Through extensive experiments across
several tasks, we demonstrate that SAD-Flower outperforms various
generative-model-based baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiple systems need to collaboratively learn control policies under model uncertainty and adversarial corruption, requiring robust methods that can handle corrupted data.

Method: Proposed clustered multitask approach integrating clustering, system identification, and resilient aggregation to filter out adversarial model updates.

Result: Established non-asymptotic bounds showing regret decreases inversely with number of honest systems per cluster, preserved under bounded fraction of adversarial systems.

Conclusion: The clustered approach enables robust collaborative learning in adversarial environments by leveraging clustering accuracy and resilient aggregation techniques.

Abstract: We study adversarially robust multitask adaptive linear quadratic control; a
setting where multiple systems collaboratively learn control policies under
model uncertainty and adversarial corruption. We propose a clustered multitask
approach that integrates clustering and system identification with resilient
aggregation to mitigate corrupted model updates. Our analysis characterizes how
clustering accuracy, intra-cluster heterogeneity, and adversarial behavior
affect the expected regret of certainty-equivalent (CE) control across LQR
tasks. We establish non-asymptotic bounds demonstrating that the regret
decreases inversely with the number of honest systems per cluster and that this
reduction is preserved under a bounded fraction of adversarial systems within
each cluster.

*Naveen Raj Manoharan,Hassan Iqbal,Krishna Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A parameter-efficient conditioning mechanism for graph network-based simulators that enables adaptation to different material parameters by targeting early message-passing layers, achieving accurate long-term rollouts with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph network-based simulators are typically trained for single material types and fail to generalize across different constitutive behaviors, limiting their real-world engineering applications.

Method: Proposed Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) conditioning mechanism targeting early message-passing layers, based on the insight that material sensitivity is concentrated in these layers. Fine-tunes only first 1-5 of 10 MP layers.

Result: Achieves accurate long-term rollouts on unseen, interpolated, or moderately extrapolated material values with only 12 short simulation trajectories (5x data reduction vs baseline). Successfully applied to inverse problems for identifying unknown cohesion parameters.

Conclusion: Enables GNS use in inverse design and closed-loop control where material properties are design variables, providing parameter-efficient adaptation to diverse material behaviors.

Abstract: Graph network-based simulators (GNS) have demonstrated strong potential for
learning particle-based physics (such as fluids, deformable solids, and
granular flows) while generalizing to unseen geometries due to their inherent
inductive biases. However, existing models are typically trained for a single
material type and fail to generalize across distinct constitutive behaviors,
limiting their applicability in real-world engineering settings. Using granular
flows as a running example, we propose a parameter-efficient conditioning
mechanism that makes the GNS model adaptive to material parameters. We identify
that sensitivity to material properties is concentrated in the early
message-passing (MP) layers, a finding we link to the local nature of
constitutive models (e.g., Mohr-Coulomb) and their effects on information
propagation. We empirically validate this by showing that fine-tuning only the
first few (1-5) of 10 MP layers of a pretrained model achieves comparable test
performance as compared to fine-tuning the entire network. Building on this
insight, we propose a parameter-efficient Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM)
conditioning mechanism designed to specifically target these early layers. This
approach produces accurate long-term rollouts on unseen, interpolated, or
moderately extrapolated values (e.g., up to 2.5 degrees for friction angle and
0.25 kPa for cohesion) when trained exclusively on as few as 12 short
simulation trajectories from new materials, representing a 5-fold data
reduction compared to a baseline multi-task learning method. Finally, we
validate the model's utility by applying it to an inverse problem, successfully
identifying unknown cohesion parameters from trajectory data. This approach
enables the use of GNS in inverse design and closed-loop control tasks where
material properties are treated as design variables.

TL;DR: Synapse is a novel arbitration framework that dynamically combines multiple pre-trained Time Series Foundational Models (TSFMs) by adaptively weighting their outputs based on context-dependent performance, outperforming individual models and traditional ensembling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different TSFMs exhibit highly variable performance across forecasting tasks due to divergent training protocols and data sources, creating an opportunity to leverage their complementary expertise through arbitration.

Method: Proposed Synapse framework that dynamically leverages a pool of TSFMs, assigns and adjusts predictive weights based on relative context-dependent performance, and constructs robust forecast distributions by adaptively sampling from constituent models' output quantiles.

Result: Experimental results show Synapse consistently outperforms other popular ensembling techniques and individual TSFMs across various forecasting settings.

Conclusion: Synapse demonstrates effective arbitration of TSFMs' complementary expertise, providing robust time series forecasting by dynamically leveraging multiple foundational models based on their specialized performance profiles.

Abstract: Pre-trained Time Series Foundational Models (TSFMs) represent a significant
advance, capable of forecasting diverse time series with complex
characteristics, including varied seasonalities, trends, and long-range
dependencies. Despite their primary goal of universal time series forecasting,
their efficacy is far from uniform; divergent training protocols and data
sources cause individual TSFMs to exhibit highly variable performance across
different forecasting tasks, domains, and horizons. Leveraging this
complementary expertise by arbitrating existing TSFM outputs presents a
compelling strategy, yet this remains a largely unexplored area of research. In
this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of how different TSFMs exhibit
specialized performance profiles across various forecasting settings, and how
we can effectively leverage this behavior in arbitration between different time
series models. We specifically analyze how factors such as model selection and
forecast horizon distribution can influence the efficacy of arbitration
strategies. Based on this analysis, we propose Synapse, a novel arbitration
framework for TSFMs. Synapse is designed to dynamically leverage a pool of
TSFMs, assign and adjust predictive weights based on their relative,
context-dependent performance, and construct a robust forecast distribution by
adaptively sampling from the output quantiles of constituent models.
Experimental results demonstrate that Synapse consistently outperforms other
popular ensembling techniques as well as individual TSFMs, demonstrating
Synapse's efficacy in time series forecasting.

Through this framework, we demonstrate significant enhancements to these

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TUPANN is a satellite-only precipitation nowcasting model that decomposes forecasts into physically meaningful components using optical-flow supervision, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple climates and lead times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current short-term precipitation forecasts rely heavily on dense weather-radar networks, which limits operational value in regions most vulnerable to climate extremes where radar coverage may be sparse.

Method: TUPANN uses a variational encoder-decoder to infer motion and intensity fields from satellite imagery under optical-flow supervision, a lead-time-conditioned MaxViT to evolve the latent state, and a differentiable advection operator to reconstruct future frames.

Result: TUPANN achieves best or second-best performance in most settings across four distinct climates (Rio de Janeiro, Manaus, Miami, La Paz) at 10-180min lead times, with pronounced gains at higher precipitation thresholds. Training on multiple cities improves performance, and the model produces smooth, interpretable motion fields aligned with numerical optical flow.

Conclusion: Physically aligned learning can provide skillful, transferable, and global precipitation nowcasts that run in near real-time using satellite data alone, making them valuable for regions with limited radar coverage.

Abstract: Accurate short-term precipitation forecasts predominantly rely on dense
weather-radar networks, limiting operational value in places most exposed to
climate extremes. We present TUPANN (Transferable and Universal Physics-Aligned
Nowcasting Network), a satellite-only model trained on GOES-16 RRQPE. Unlike
most deep learning models for nowcasting, TUPANN decomposes the forecast into
physically meaningful components: a variational encoder-decoder infers motion
and intensity fields from recent imagery under optical-flow supervision, a
lead-time-conditioned MaxViT evolves the latent state, and a differentiable
advection operator reconstructs future frames. We evaluate TUPANN on both
GOES-16 and IMERG data, in up to four distinct climates (Rio de Janeiro,
Manaus, Miami, La Paz) at 10-180min lead times using the CSI and HSS metrics
over 4-64 mm/h thresholds. Comparisons against optical-flow, deep learning and
hybrid baselines show that TUPANN achieves the best or second-best skill in
most settings, with pronounced gains at higher thresholds. Training on multiple
cities further improves performance, while cross-city experiments show modest
degradation and occasional gains for rare heavy-rain regimes. The model
produces smooth, interpretable motion fields aligned with numerical optical
flow and runs in near real time due to the low latency of GOES-16. These
results indicate that physically aligned learning can provide nowcasts that are
skillful, transferable and global.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wireless soil sensing solutions require frequent recalibration to handle variations in soil texture and organic carbon content, limiting their practical deployment in precision agriculture.

Method: SoilX uses a tetrahedral antenna array with antenna-switching mechanism for robust dielectric permittivity measurement, and employs Contrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL) with Orthogonality Regularizer and Separation Loss to disentangle cross-component interference.

Result: SoilX reduces estimation errors by 23.8% to 31.5% compared to baseline methods and demonstrates good generalization to unseen fields without recalibration.

Conclusion: SoilX provides a practical, calibration-free solution for comprehensive soil monitoring that can handle variations in soil texture and composition, making it suitable for real-world precision agriculture applications.

Abstract: Precision agriculture demands continuous and accurate monitoring of soil
moisture (M) and key macronutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P),
and potassium (K), to optimize yields and conserve resources. Wireless soil
sensing has been explored to measure these four components; however, current
solutions require recalibration (i.e., retraining the data processing model) to
handle variations in soil texture, characterized by aluminosilicates (Al) and
organic carbon (C), limiting their practicality. To address this, we introduce
SoilX, a calibration-free soil sensing system that jointly measures six key
components: {M, N, P, K, C, Al}. By explicitly modeling C and Al, SoilX
eliminates texture- and carbon-dependent recalibration. SoilX incorporates
Contrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL), with two customized terms: the
Orthogonality Regularizer and the Separation Loss, to effectively disentangle
cross-component interference. Additionally, we design a novel tetrahedral
antenna array with an antenna-switching mechanism, which can robustly measure
soil dielectric permittivity independent of device placement. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SoilX reduces estimation errors by 23.8% to 31.5%
over baselines and generalizes well to unseen fields.

*Dawn Virginillo,Asja Derviškadić,Mario Paolone*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper addresses power system restoration planning by incorporating frequency dynamics to ensure both static and dynamic stability, demonstrating that static-only approaches can violate dynamic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent blackout incidents and increased system complexity due to the energy transition have highlighted the need to re-evaluate power system restoration plans, particularly ensuring dynamic stability in low-inertia restoration scenarios.

Method: The authors formulate an optimal power system restoration problem including frequency dynamics, validate switching constraints using brute-force tree search on a static version, and apply the dynamic formulation to the IEEE 9-Bus model.

Result: The study shows that optimal switching sequences derived from static formulations would violate dynamic constraints, demonstrating the critical importance of considering dynamic stability in restoration planning.

Conclusion: Dynamic considerations are essential in power system restoration planning, as static-only approaches can lead to unstable restoration sequences that fail to maintain system frequency stability.

Abstract: Due to recent blackout and system split incidents in power grids worldwide,
as well as increased system complexity in view of the energy transition, there
has been increasing interest in re-evaluating existing Power System Restoration
(PSR) plans. In restoration scenarios, due to low island inertia, it is
necessary to ensure not only the static, but also the dynamic stability of the
system. In this paper, we pose and solve a formulation of the optimal PSR
problem including frequency dynamics. We validate the switching constraints for
global optimality within a static version of the formulation using a
brute-force tree search method. We apply the dynamic problem formulation to the

TL;DR: Joint optimization of transmit power allocation and radiation coefficients in NOMA-assisted Pinching Antenna Systems to maximize sum rate through alternating optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the flexible channel adjustment of Pinching Antenna Systems and NOMA's power allocation adaptability for improved sum-rate performance in downlink communications.

Method: Decompose the non-convex problem into two sub-problems: transmit power allocation (solved with closed-form solutions) and PA radiation power allocation (solved using successive convex approximation), then use Alternating Optimization with two decoding order approaches (exhaustive search and low-complexity alternative).

Result: The proposed approach substantially improves system sum-rate compared to equal power allocation PASS schemes.

Conclusion: Joint optimization of power allocation and radiation coefficients in NOMA-assisted PASS systems effectively enhances sum-rate performance through the proposed alternating optimization framework.

Abstract: This paper explores a joint optimization of transmit power allocation and
radiation coefficients in a downlink Pinching Antenna SyStem (PASS) employing
Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA). By leveraging the PASS-enabled flexible
channel adjustment and NOMA's power allocation adaptability, a sum rate
maximization problem is formulated with the objective of simultaneously
optimizing base station (BS)'s transmit power coefficients and pinching antenna
(PA)'s radiation powers. Due to its non-convexity and complexity, the
formulated optimization problem is challenging to solve directly. Hence, we
decompose the main problem into two sub-problems, namely transmit power
allocation sub-problem and PA radiation power allocation sub-problem. In the
first sub-problem, closed-form solutions are derived for the BS's power
allocation among NOMA users. Meanwhile, in the second sub-problem, we optimize
the PA's radiation power utilizing successive convex approximation (SCA). These
two sub-problems are solved alternatively using Alternating Optimization (AO)
until convergence. It should be noted that decoding order plays a significant
role in NOMA-assisted PASS. Hence, two variations of decoding order are
considered, namely: i) a high-complexity exhaustive search approach, and, ii) a
low-complexity alternative that utilizes pre-determined channel information.
Numerical results show that our proposed approach substantially improves the
system's sum-rate compared to widely adopted equal power allocation PASS
schemes.

*Haochen Wu,Yuanbin Chen,Yang Ming,Zhaocheng Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes a two-timescale optimization scheme for holographic MIMO surfaces that minimizes transmission power while maintaining QoS, using statistical CSI for beampattern optimization and instantaneous CSI for precoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HMIMOS systems have high computational complexity and signaling overhead with traditional beamforming due to numerous radiation elements requiring instantaneous CSI.

Method: Two-timescale optimization: statistical CSI for BS/UE beampattern optimization using CSSCA algorithm, and instantaneous CSI for precoding matrix design.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed method effectively reduces transmission power while maintaining QoS compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The two-timescale scheme successfully addresses HMIMOS computational complexity issues while ensuring system performance with minimal power consumption.

Abstract: Benefiting from the rapid development of metamaterials and metasurfaces, the
holographic multiple-input and multiple-output surface (HMIMOS) has been
regarded as a promising solution for future wireless networks recently. By
densely packing numerous radiation elements together, HMIMOS is capable of
realizing accurate beamforming with low hardware complexity. However, enormous
radiation elements on the HMIMOS lead to high computational complexity and
signaling overhead when applying traditional beamforming schemes relying on
instantaneous channel state information (CSI). To tackle this problem, we
propose a two-timescale optimization scheme to minimize the required
transmission power under the constraint of all users' quality-of-service (QoS).
Specifically, the beampatterns at the base station (BS) and the user equippment
(UE) are optimized over the slowly changing statistical CSI based on the
constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) algorithm. Then,
the instantaneous CSI is utilized to design the precoding matrix in order to
ensure the system performance without significant increase in computational
cost, due to the small number of feeds on the HMIMOS. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to other
baselines.

Conclusion: PECL effectively addresses limitations of single-domain radar signals by integrating multi-domain processing with attention and temporal modeling, achieving superior accuracy while maintaining moderate computational complexity.

Abstract: Radar systems are increasingly favored for medical applications because they
provide non-intrusive monitoring with high privacy and robustness to lighting
conditions. However, existing research typically relies on single-domain radar
signals and overlooks the temporal dependencies inherent in human activity,
which complicates the classification of similar actions. To address this issue,
we designed the Parallel-EfficientNet-CBAM-LSTM (PECL) network to process data
in three complementary domains: Range-Time, Doppler-Time, and Range-Doppler.
PECL combines a channel-spatial attention module and temporal units to capture
more features and dynamic dependencies during action sequences, improving both
accuracy and robustness. The experimental results show that PECL achieves an
accuracy of 96.16% on the same dataset, outperforming existing methods by at
least 4.78%. PECL also performs best in distinguishing between easily confused
actions. Despite its strong performance, PECL maintains moderate model
complexity, with 23.42M parameters and 1324.82M FLOPs. Its parameter-efficient
design further reduces computational cost.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of hardware impairments in antenna

TL;DR: BORN is a blind beamforming algorithm for RIS that uses only RSS measurements, achieving near-optimal performance with O(N log N) samples through quadratic model estimation and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable RIS configuration without requiring channel state information or geometric models, making it compatible with commodity hardware and overcoming limitations of existing blind beamforming methods.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Sensing stage estimates quadratic model from RSS measurements, 2) Optimization stage computes optimal RIS configuration using the estimated quadratic model.

Result: Achieves provable near-optimal performance with O(N log N) samples, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art blind beamforming algorithms, especially in NLOS scenarios with weak background channels.

Conclusion: BORN demonstrates that quadratic models are learnable under Rademacher distributions and provides an efficient blind beamforming solution that works well in practical scenarios without CSI.

Abstract: Blind beamforming has emerged as a promising approach to configure
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) without relying on channel state
information (CSI) or geometric models, making it directly compatible with
commodity hardware. In this paper, we propose a new blind beamforming
algorithm, so-called Blind Optimal RIS Beamforming with Sensing
(\textsc{BORN}), that operates using only received signal strength (RSS). In
contrast to existing methods that rely on majority-voting mechanisms,
\textsc{BORN} exploits the intrinsic quadratic structure of the received
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The algorithm proceeds in two stages:
\emph{sensing}, where a quadratic model is estimated from RSS measurements, and
\emph{optimization}, where the RIS configuration is obtained using the
estimated quadratic model. Our novelties are twofold. Firstly, we show for the
first time, that \textsc{BORN} can achieve provable near-optimal performance
using only $O(N \log_2(N))$ samples, where $N$ is the number of RIS elements.
As a by-product of our analysis, we show that quadratic models are learnable
under Rademacher feature distributions when the second-order coefficient matrix
is low-rank. This result, to our knowledge, has not been established in prior
matrix sensing literature. Secondly, extensive simulations and real-world field
tests demonstrate that \textsc{BORN} achieves near-optimal performance,
substantially outperforming state-of-the-art blind beamforming algorithms,
particularly in scenarios with a weak background channel such as
non-line-of-sight (NLOS).

Result: Extensive simulations show over 50% reduction in average handover interruption time, lower handover rates, and enhanced communication performance.

Conclusion: The proposed ISAC-based framework effectively improves handover efficiency in high-mobility V2I scenarios by eliminating feedback overhead and enabling proactive decisions.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) has emerged as a promising
solution in addressing the challenges of high-mobility scenarios in 5G NR
Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications. This paper proposes a novel
sensing-assisted handover framework that leverages ISAC capabilities to enable
precise beamforming and proactive handover decisions. Two sensing-enabled
handover triggering algorithms are developed: a distance-based scheme that
utilizes estimated spatial positioning, and a probability-based approach that
predicts vehicle maneuvers using interacting multiple model extended Kalman
filter (IMM-EKF) tracking. The proposed methods eliminate the need for uplink
feedback and beam sweeping, thus significantly reducing signaling overhead and
handover interruption time. A sensing-assisted NR frame structure and
corresponding protocol design are also introduced to support rapid
synchronization and access under vehicular mobility. Extensive link-level
simulations using real-world map data demonstrate that the proposed framework
reduces the average handover interruption time by over 50%, achieves lower
handover rates, and enhances overall communication performance.

Conclusion: First system enabling low-complexity, low-bandwidth absolute 3D localization with millimeter-level accuracy in generic wireless networks, with open-source hardware development.

Abstract: Localization is a key feature of future Sixth Generation (6G) net-works with
foreseen accuracy requirements down to the millimeter level, to enable novel
applications in the fields of telesurgery, high-precision manufacturing, and
others. Currently, such accuracy requirements are only achievable with
specialized or highly resource-demanding systems, rendering them impractical
for more wide-spread deployment. In this paper, we present the first system
that enables low-complexity and low-bandwidth absolute 3D localization with
millimeter-level accuracy in generic wireless networks. It performs a carrier
phase-based wireless localization refinement of an initial location estimate
based on successive location-likelihood optimization across multiple bands.
Unlike previous phase unwrapping methods, our solution is one-shot. We evaluate
its performance collecting ~350, 000 measurements, showing an improvement of
more than one order of magnitude over classical localization techniques.
Finally, we will open-source the low-cost, modular FR3 front-end that we
developed for the experimental campaign.

TL;DR: The paper proposes location-based interference suppression algorithms for cell-free Massive MIMO systems that work without full channel state information, using user location data instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Future mobile networks need novel signal processing for user-centric cell-free deployments, with challenges including limited CSI availability and coexistence with other services like radar.

Method: Developed algorithmic alterations to existing precoding methods using location information, validated with empirical channel measurements from an indoor distributed Massive MIMO testbed, including hardware calibration.

Result: The proposed methods enable location-based interference suppression without explicit CSI knowledge at the transmitter under realistic network conditions.

Conclusion: Location-informed precoding algorithms can effectively suppress interference in dense cell-free Massive MIMO deployments when full channel state information is unavailable.

Abstract: The evolution of mobile networks towards user-centric cell-free distributed
Massive MIMO configurations requires the development of novel signal processing
techniques. More specifically, digital precoding algorithms have to be designed
or adopted to enable distributed operation. Future deployments are expected to
improve coexistence between cellular generations, and between mobile networks
and incumbent services such as radar. In dense cell-free deployments, it might
also not be possible to have full channel state information for all users at
all antennas. To leverage location information in a dense deployment area, we
suggest and investigate several algorithmic alterations on existing precoding
methods, aimed at location-informed interference suppression, for usage in
existing and emerging systems where user locations are known. The proposed
algorithms are derived using a theoretical channel model and validated and
numerically evaluated using an empirical dataset containing channel
measurements from an indoor distributed Massive MIMO testbed. When dealing with
measured CSI, the impact of the hardware, in addition to the location-based
channel, needs to be compensated for. We propose a method to calibrate the
hardware and achieve measurement-based evaluation of our location-based
interference suppression algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed
methods allow location-based interference suppression without explicit CSI
knowledge at the transmitter, under certain realistic network conditions.

TL;DR: Proposes IRS sharing among multiple mobile network operators to enhance 6G network coverage while reducing costs and interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited mmWave coverage and high infrastructure costs in 6G networks, while avoiding inefficiencies from separate IRS deployments per operator.

Method: Developed an IRS sharing system where multiple MNOs collaborate using common IRS infrastructure, analyzed through numerical simulations.

Result: IRS sharing effectively balances performance and fairness among MNOs, outperforming operator-specific deployments in multi-operator scenarios.

Conclusion: IRS sharing supports sustainable 6G networks by enabling efficient deployment and operation of next-generation wireless systems.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the use of intelligent reflecting surfaces
(IRSs) in multi-operator communication systems for 6G networks, focusing on
sustainable and efficient resource management. This research is motivated by
two critical challenges: limited coverage provided by mmWave frequencies and
high infrastructure costs associated with current technologies. IRSs can help
eliminate these issues because they can reflect electromagnetic waves to
enhance signal propagation, thereby reducing blockages and extending network
coverage. However, deploying a separate IRS for each mobile network operator
(MNO) can result in inefficiencies, redundant infrastructure, potential
conflicts over placement, and interoperator interference. To address these
challenges, in this study, an IRS sharing system is proposed in which multiple
MNOs collaborate to use a common IRS infrastructure. This approach not only
enhances network flexibility and reduces costs but also minimizes the effect of
interoperator interference. Through numerical analysis, we demonstrate that IRS
sharing effectively balances performance and fairness among MNOs, outperforming
MNO-specific deployment methods in multi-MNO scenarios. This study provides
insights into the potential of IRS sharing to support sustainable 6G networks,
thereby contributing to the efficient deployment and operation of
next-generation wireless communication systems.

Conclusion: The systematic approach provides explicit descriptions of transposition and duality operations in skew polynomial ring quotients, establishing new inequivalent MRD code families.

Abstract: Skew polynomial rings provide a fundamental example of noncommutative

TL;DR: A novel entropy rank ratio R is introduced to measure DNA sequence complexity by positioning sequences within the global entropy distribution, avoiding saturation effects of Shannon entropy. This metric is integrated into data augmentation for CNNs, achieving improved classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shannon entropy suffers from saturation effects that limit discriminative power for long uniform DNA segments, necessitating a more robust complexity measure.

Method: Develop entropy rank ratio R that computes the proportion of sequences with equal or lower entropy than the target. Use combinatorial framework to derive complete entropy distribution. Integrate R into CNN data augmentation via ratio-guided cropping techniques.

Result: Models augmented via R achieve substantial gains in classification accuracy on viral genes and human genes with polynucleotide expansions using lightweight architectures, outperforming random, entropy-based, and compression-based methods.

Conclusion: The entropy rank ratio R provides a normalized, distribution-aware measure that avoids saturation and enables effective data augmentation for DNA sequence classification tasks.

Abstract: Shannon entropy is widely used to measure the complexity of DNA sequences but
suffers from saturation effects that limit its discriminative power for long
uniform segments. We introduce a novel metric, the entropy rank ratio R, which
positions a target sequence within the full distribution of all possible
sequences of the same length by computing the proportion of sequences that have
an entropy value equal to or lower than that of the target. In other words, R
expresses the relative position of a sequence within the global entropy
spectrum, assigning values close to 0 for highly ordered sequences and close to
1 for highly disordered ones. DNA sequences are partitioned into fixed-length
subsequences and non-overlapping n-mer groups; frequency vectors become ordered
integer partitions and a combinatorial framework is used to derive the complete
entropy distribution. Unlike classical measures, R is a normalized,
distribution-aware measure bounded in [0,1] at fixed (T,n), which avoids
saturation to log2 4 and makes values comparable across sequences under the
same settings. We integrate R into data augmentation for convolutional neural
networks by proposing ratio-guided cropping techniques and benchmark them
against random, entropy-based, and compression-based methods. On two
independent datasets, viral genes and human genes with polynucleotide
expansions, models augmented via R achieve substantial gains in classification
accuracy using extremely lightweight architectures.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper studies shortest self-orthogonal embeddings of binary linear codes, focusing on Hamming codes and Reed-Muller codes. It shows that shortest self-orthogonal embeddings of binary Hamming codes are self-dual, and presents algorithms to construct self-dual codes from Hamming codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is recent interest in shortest self-orthogonal embeddings of binary linear codes because many such codes are optimal self-orthogonal codes. The paper aims to determine the length of shortest self-orthogonal embeddings using properties of the hull of linear codes.

Method: The authors use properties of the hull of linear codes to determine shortest self-orthogonal embeddings. They propose two algorithms to construct self-dual codes from Hamming codes, and use shortest SO embeddings to obtain optimal self-orthogonal codes.

Result: The paper constructs a self-dual [22, 11, 6] code from the binary [15, 11, 3] Hamming code H4, and a self-dual [52, 26, 8] code from the binary [31, 26, 3] Hamming code H5.

Conclusion: Shortest self-orthogonal embeddings of binary Hamming codes are self-dual, and the proposed algorithms successfully construct self-dual codes from Hamming codes. The method produces optimal self-orthogonal codes with new parameters.

Abstract: There has been recent interest in the study of shortest self-orthogonal
embeddings of binary linear codes, since many such codes are optimal
self-orthogonal codes. Several authors have studied the length of a shortest
self-orthogonal embedding of a given binary code $\mathcal C$, or equivalently,
the minimum number of columns that must be added to a generator matrix of
$\mathcal C$ to form a generator matrix of a self-orthogonal code. In this
paper, we use properties of the hull of a linear code to determine the length
of a shortest self-orthogonal embedding of any binary linear code. We focus on
the examples of Hamming codes and Reed-Muller codes. We show that a shortest
self-orthogonal embedding of a binary Hamming code is self-dual, and propose
two algorithms to construct self-dual codes from Hamming codes $\mathcal H_r$.
Using these algorithms, we construct a self-dual $[22, 11, 6]$ code, called the
shortened Golay code, from the binary $[15, 11, 3]$ Hamming code $\mathcal
H_4$, and construct a self-dual $[52, 26, 8]$ code from the binary $[31, 26,
3]$ Hamming code $\mathcal H_5$. We use shortest SO embeddings of linear codes
to obtain many inequivalent optimal self-orthogonal codes of dimension $7$ and
$8$ for several lengths. Four of the codes of dimension $8$ that we construct
are codes with new parameters such as $[91, 8, 42],\, [98, 8, 46],\,[114, 8,
54]$, and $[191, 8, 94]$.

### [158] [Epistemic Reject Option Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04855)
*Vojtech Franc,Jakub Paplham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an epistemic reject-option predictor that abstains from predictions in regions of high epistemic uncertainty caused by insufficient training data, addressing limitations of traditional approaches that only consider aleatoric uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reject-option prediction focuses only on aleatoric uncertainty, assuming large training data makes epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios with limited data, this assumption is unrealistic, requiring a framework that accounts for epistemic uncertainty.

Method: Building on Bayesian learning, the authors redefine the optimal predictor as one that minimizes expected regret - the performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when regret exceeds a specified rejection cost.

Result: The paper presents the first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable decisions.

Conclusion: The epistemic reject-option predictor provides a theoretically grounded approach for uncertainty quantification in practical scenarios with limited data, allowing models to abstain from predictions when epistemic uncertainty is high due to insufficient training data.

Abstract: In high-stakes applications, predictive models must not only produce accurate
predictions but also quantify and communicate their uncertainty. Reject-option
prediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction
uncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on
aleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes
the epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios,
limited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the
epistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic
uncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we
redefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the
performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with
full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for
a given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the
first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of
identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable
decisions.

### [159] [DMA: Online RAG Alignment with Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04880)
*Yu Bai,Yukai Miao,Dawei Wang,Li Chen,Fei Long,Rundi Zhai,Dan Li,Yanyu Ren,Tianfeng Liu,Hongtao Xie,Ce Yang,Xuhui Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DMA is an online learning framework that uses multi-granularity human feedback to dynamically align ranking in RAG systems, improving adaptation to evolving user intent while maintaining baseline retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems use static retrieval that cannot adapt to evolving user intent and content drift, limiting their effectiveness in interactive settings.

Method: DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level feedback into a learning pipeline with supervised training for rankers, policy optimization using response preferences, and knowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency serving.

Result: Online deployment showed substantial improvements in human engagement, while offline tests on knowledge-intensive benchmarks (TriviaQA, HotpotQA) demonstrated competitive foundational retrieval with notable gains on conversational QA.

Conclusion: DMA provides a principled approach for feedback-driven, real-time adaptation in RAG systems without sacrificing baseline capabilities.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often rely on static retrieval,
limiting adaptation to evolving intent and content drift. We introduce Dynamic
Memory Alignment (DMA), an online learning framework that systematically
incorporates multi-granularity human feedback to align ranking in interactive
settings. DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level signals into a
coherent learning pipeline: supervised training for pointwise and listwise
rankers, policy optimization driven by response-level preferences, and
knowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency serving.
Throughout this paper, memory refers to the model's working memory, which is
the entire context visible to the LLM for In-Context Learning.
  We adopt a dual-track evaluation protocol mirroring deployment: (i)
large-scale online A/B ablations to isolate the utility of each feedback
source, and (ii) few-shot offline tests on knowledge-intensive benchmarks.
Online, a multi-month industrial deployment further shows substantial
improvements in human engagement. Offline, DMA preserves competitive
foundational retrieval while yielding notable gains on conversational QA
(TriviaQA, HotpotQA). Taken together, these results position DMA as a
principled approach to feedback-driven, real-time adaptation in RAG without
sacrificing baseline capability.

*Yule Wen,Yixin Ye,Yanzhe Zhang,Diyi Yang,Hao Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces real-time reasoning as a new problem for agents in dynamic environments, showing current models struggle with timely judgments. Proposes AgileThinker that combines reactive and planning paradigms to balance reasoning depth and response latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world agents need to make both logical and timely judgments in dynamic environments where hazards emerge and opportunities arise while reasoning is still unfolding. Current approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature.

Method: Built Real-Time Reasoning Gym to study two paradigms: reactive agents (bounded reasoning for rapid responses) and planning agents (extended reasoning for complex problems). Proposed AgileThinker that simultaneously engages both reasoning paradigms.

Result: State-of-the-art models struggle with making logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. AgileThinker consistently outperforms single-paradigm agents as task difficulty and time pressure rise, effectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency.

Conclusion: Establishes real-time reasoning as a critical testbed for practical agents and provides foundation for temporally constrained AI systems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents.

Abstract: Agents in the real world must make not only logical but also timely
judgments. This requires continuous awareness of the dynamic environment:
hazards emerge, opportunities arise, and other agents act, while the agent's
reasoning is still unfolding. Despite advances in language model reasoning,
existing approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature. We introduce
real-time reasoning as a new problem formulation for agents in evolving
environments and build Real-Time Reasoning Gym to demonstrate it. We study two
paradigms for deploying language models in agents: (1) reactive agents, which
employ language models with bounded reasoning computation for rapid responses,
and (2) planning agents, which allow extended reasoning computation for complex
problems. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with
making logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. To address this
limitation, we propose AgileThinker, which simultaneously engages both
reasoning paradigms. AgileThinker consistently outperforms agents engaging only
one reasoning paradigm as the task difficulty and time pressure rise,
effectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency. Our work
establishes real-time reasoning as a critical testbed for developing practical
agents and provides a foundation for research in temporally constrained AI
systems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents.

*Maria Mahbub,Vanessa Lama,Sanjay Das,Brian Starks,Christopher Polchek,Saffell Silvers,Lauren Deck,Prasanna Balaprakash,Tirthankar Ghosal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORCHID is a modular agentic system for High-Risk Property classification at DOE sites that combines RAG with human oversight to create auditable policy-based decisions, improving accuracy and traceability over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional expert-only workflows for HRP classification are time-consuming, backlog-prone, and struggle to keep pace with evolving export control policies, requiring a more efficient and transparent solution.

Method: Uses small cooperating agents (retrieval, description refiner, classifier, validator, feedback logger) coordinated via agent-to-agent messaging and MCP for model-agnostic on-premise operation, following an Item to Evidence to Decision loop with step-by-step reasoning and citations.

Result: In preliminary tests on real HRP cases, ORCHID improves accuracy and traceability over non-agentic baseline while deferring uncertain items to Subject Matter Experts.

Conclusion: ORCHID demonstrates a practical path to trustworthy LLM assistance in sensitive DOE compliance workflows through grounded citations, SME feedback capture, and exportable audit artifacts.

Abstract: High-Risk Property (HRP) classification is critical at U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) sites, where inventories include sensitive and often dual-use
equipment. Compliance must track evolving rules designated by various export
control policies to make transparent and auditable decisions. Traditional
expert-only workflows are time-consuming, backlog-prone, and struggle to keep
pace with shifting regulatory boundaries. We demo ORCHID, a modular agentic
system for HRP classification that pairs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
with human oversight to produce policy-based outputs that can be audited. Small
cooperating agents, retrieval, description refiner, classifier, validator, and
feedback logger, coordinate via agent-to-agent messaging and invoke tools
through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for model-agnostic on-premise
operation. The interface follows an Item to Evidence to Decision loop with
step-by-step reasoning, on-policy citations, and append-only audit bundles
(run-cards, prompts, evidence). In preliminary tests on real HRP cases, ORCHID
improves accuracy and traceability over a non-agentic baseline while deferring
uncertain items to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The demonstration shows
single item submission, grounded citations, SME feedback capture, and
exportable audit artifacts, illustrating a practical path to trustworthy LLM
assistance in sensitive DOE compliance workflows.

*Johan Schubert,Patrik Hansen,Pontus Hörling,Ronnie Johansson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A methodology for generating and evaluating military courses of action for mechanized battalions, creating thousands of alternatives and assessing them based on opponent status, unit composition, and battle outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support decision-making during military ground combat operations by providing systematic recommendations for mechanized battalion actions.

Method: Generates thousands of action alternatives, evaluates them based on opponent status and actions, considers unit composition and force ratios, and uses field manuals for battle outcome assessment. Generation and evaluation occur concurrently.

Result: Produces alternative courses of action with superior outcomes and facilitates management of new course generation based on previously evaluated actions.

Conclusion: The approach enables revised course formulation as combat conditions evolve, supporting sequential decision-making for military commanders.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a methodology designed to support decision-making
during the execution phase of military ground combat operations, with a focus
on one's actions. This methodology generates and evaluates recommendations for
various courses of action for a mechanized battalion, commencing with an
initial set assessed by their anticipated outcomes. It systematically produces
thousands of individual action alternatives, followed by evaluations aimed at
identifying alternative courses of action with superior outcomes. These
alternatives are appraised in light of the opponent's status and actions,
considering unit composition, force ratios, types of offense and defense, and
anticipated advance rates. Field manuals evaluate battle outcomes and
advancement rates. The processes of generation and evaluation work
concurrently, yielding a variety of alternative courses of action. This
approach facilitates the management of new course generation based on
previously evaluated actions. As the combat unfolds and conditions evolve,
revised courses of action are formulated for the decision-maker within a
sequential decision-making framework.

*Valeriu Dimidov,Faisal Hawlader,Sasan Jafarnejad,Raphaël Frank*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based agents show promise for cleaning predictive maintenance logs by handling generic noise types effectively, though domain-specific errors remain challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Economic constraints, limited datasets, and expertise shortages hinder predictive maintenance adoption in automotive sector; LLMs offer opportunity to overcome these barriers and accelerate industrial implementation.

Method: Evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise in maintenance logs (typos, missing fields, near-duplicates, incorrect dates, etc.) to support PdM data pipelines.

Result: LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks and provide promising foundation for industrial applications, though domain-specific errors remain challenging.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents offer potential for predictive maintenance data cleaning pipelines, with opportunities for further improvement through specialized training and enhanced agentic capabilities.

Abstract: Economic constraints, limited availability of datasets for reproducibility
and shortages of specialized expertise have long been recognized as key
challenges to the adoption and advancement of predictive maintenance (PdM) in
the automotive sector. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents
an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM
from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the
potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically,
we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training
well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors
such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We
evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise.
Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks
and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While
domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the
potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced
agentic capabilities.

*Sijie Yang,Jiatong Li,Filip Biljecki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework that integrates reasoning capabilities with multi-agent collaboration to assist human planners in decision-making, verification, and trade-off analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance from AI-based urban planning analysis to AI-assisted decision-making that can recommend sites, allocate resources, and evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and stakeholder values.

Method: A framework integrating three cognitive layers (Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis, Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through multi-agent collaboration, using reasoning AI techniques like CoT prompting and ReAct.

Result: The framework demonstrates that planning decisions require explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based, rule-grounded, and explainable - requirements that statistical learning alone cannot fulfill.

Conclusion: AI agents can augment human planners by systematically exploring solution spaces, verifying regulatory compliance, and deliberating over trade-offs transparently, amplifying human judgment with computational reasoning capabilities rather than replacing it.

Abstract: AI has proven highly successful at urban planning analysis -- learning
patterns from data to predict future conditions. The next frontier is
AI-assisted decision-making: agents that recommend sites, allocate resources,
and evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and
stakeholder values. Recent breakthroughs in reasoning AI -- CoT prompting,
ReAct, and multi-agent collaboration frameworks -- now make this vision
achievable.
  This position paper presents the Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework for
reasoning-capable planning agents that integrates three cognitive layers
(Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis,
Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a
multi-agents collaboration framework. We demonstrate why planning decisions
require explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based (applying
normative principles), rule-grounded (guaranteeing constraint satisfaction),
and explainable (generating transparent justifications) -- requirements that
statistical learning alone cannot fulfill. We compare reasoning agents with
statistical learning, present a comprehensive architecture with benchmark
evaluation metrics, and outline critical research challenges. This framework
shows how AI agents can augment human planners by systematically exploring
solution spaces, verifying regulatory compliance, and deliberating over
trade-offs transparently -- not replacing human judgment but amplifying it with
computational reasoning capabilities.

*Vasileios Magoulianitis,Catherine A. Alexander,Jiaxin Yang,C. -C. Jay Kuo*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: LG-NuSegHop is a self-supervised nuclei segmentation pipeline that achieves competitive performance without manual annotations, using local processing, data-driven feature extraction, and global post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nuclei segmentation is crucial for histology image analysis but is labor-intensive and requires expert physicians. Deep learning models struggle with generalization across different organ tissues and domains due to expensive data annotations.

Method: Three-module pipeline: (1) local processing operations to generate pseudolabels, (2) NuSegHop data-driven feature extraction model, (3) global operations for post-processing predictions. Entirely self-supervised without manual annotations.

Result: Outperforms other self-supervised and weakly supervised methods, competitive with fully supervised methods on three public datasets. Maintains good generalization performance across different datasets without domain adaptation.

Conclusion: LG-NuSegHop provides an effective self-supervised solution for nuclei segmentation with transparent and explainable modules that can be understood by physicians, addressing the annotation bottleneck in medical imaging.

Abstract: Nuclei segmentation is the cornerstone task in histology image reading,
shedding light on the underlying molecular patterns and leading to disease or
cancer diagnosis. Yet, it is a laborious task that requires expertise from
trained physicians. The large nuclei variability across different organ tissues
and acquisition processes challenges the automation of this task. On the other
hand, data annotations are expensive to obtain, and thus, Deep Learning (DL)
models are challenged to generalize to unseen organs or different domains. This
work proposes Local-to-Global NuSegHop (LG-NuSegHop), a self-supervised
pipeline developed on prior knowledge of the problem and molecular biology.
There are three distinct modules: (1) a set of local processing operations to
generate a pseudolabel, (2) NuSegHop a novel data-driven feature extraction
model and (3) a set of global operations to post-process the predictions of
NuSegHop. Notably, even though the proposed pipeline uses { no manually
annotated training data} or domain adaptation, it maintains a good
generalization performance on other datasets. Experiments in three publicly
available datasets show that our method outperforms other self-supervised and
weakly supervised methods while having a competitive standing among fully
supervised methods. Remarkably, every module within LG-NuSegHop is transparent
and explainable to physicians.

*S. Zhao,W. Lu,B. Wang,T. Wang,K. Zhang,H. Zhao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UHDRes is a lightweight dual-domain framework for UHD image restoration that uses spectral modulation for amplitude enhancement and spatial refinement for phase restoration, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 400K parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UHD images face severe degradations like blur, haze, rain, and low-light conditions, posing computational challenges due to high resolution. Existing methods struggle with efficiency and performance for UHD restoration.

Method: Proposes a dual-domain decoupled spectral modulation framework with spatio-spectral fusion. Uses multi-scale context aggregation for spatial features, explicit amplitude modulation in frequency domain, implicit phase restoration via spatial refinement, and a shared gated feed-forward network for efficient feature interaction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art restoration performance on five public UHD benchmarks with only 400K parameters, while significantly reducing inference latency and memory usage compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: UHDRes provides an effective and efficient solution for UHD image restoration through its dual-domain approach, demonstrating superior performance with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Ultra-high-definition (UHD) images often suffer from severe degradations such
as blur, haze, rain, or low-light conditions, which pose significant challenges
for image restoration due to their high resolution and computational demands.
In this paper, we propose UHDRes, a novel lightweight dual-domain decoupled
spectral modulation framework for UHD image restoration. It explicitly models
the amplitude spectrum via lightweight spectrum-domain modulation, while
restoring phase implicitly through spatial-domain refinement. We introduce the
spatio-spectral fusion mechanism, which first employs a multi-scale context
aggregator to extract local and global spatial features, and then performs
spectral modulation in a decoupled manner. It explicitly enhances amplitude
features in the frequency domain while implicitly restoring phase information
through spatial refinement. Additionally, a shared gated feed-forward network
is designed to efficiently promote feature interaction through shared-parameter
convolutions and adaptive gating mechanisms. Extensive experimental comparisons
on five public UHD benchmarks demonstrate that our UHDRes achieves the
state-of-the-art restoration performance with only 400K parameters, while
significantly reducing inference latency and memory usage. The codes and models
are available at https://github.com/Zhao0100/UHDRes.

*Muhammad Talha,Qi Yang,Zhu Li,Anique Akhtar,Geert Van Der Auwera*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A multi-scale postprocessing framework using graph-Fourier latent attributes, sparse convolutions, and channel-wise attention to remove blocky artifacts from GPCC-compressed point clouds, achieving significant BD-rate reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud compression methods like MPEG's GPCC introduce blocky artifacts in reconstructed point clouds, which degrade visual quality despite successful bitrate reduction.

Method: Novel multi-scale postprocessing framework that fuses graph-Fourier latent attribute representations with sparse convolutions and channel-wise attention for efficient deblocking.

Result: Achieves BD-rate reduction of 18.81% in Y channel and 18.14% in joint YUV on 8iVFBv2 dataset, with markedly improved visual fidelity and minimal overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively removes blocky artifacts from GPCC-compressed point clouds while maintaining compression efficiency and significantly improving visual quality.

Abstract: Point clouds (PC) are essential for AR/VR and autonomous driving but
challenge compression schemes with their size, irregular sampling, and
sparsity. MPEG's Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (GPCC) methods
successfully reduce bitrate; however, they introduce significant blocky
artifacts in the reconstructed point cloud. We introduce a novel multi-scale
postprocessing framework that fuses graph-Fourier latent attribute
representations with sparse convolutions and channel-wise attention to
efficiently deblock reconstructed point clouds. Against the GPCC TMC13v14
baseline, our approach achieves BD-rate reduction of 18.81\% in the Y channel
and 18.14\% in the joint YUV on the 8iVFBv2 dataset, delivering markedly
improved visual fidelity with minimal overhead.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel SPAD sensor architecture that eliminates TDCs by integrating in-sensor spike encoders, enabling histogram-free processing and real-time edge computing with reduced data complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SPAD architectures rely on TDCs and histogram-based processing, causing significant data transfer and processing challenges that limit real-time edge applications.

Method: Integrates in-sensor spike encoders that fold multiple laser repetition periods, transforming phase-based spike trains into density-based spike trains optimized for spiking neural network processing via backpropagation through time.

Result: Developed Transporter, a 128×4 SPAD sensor with per-pixel D flip-flop ring-based spike encoder, demonstrating efficient preprocessing and data compression capabilities.

Conclusion: This work presents a path toward more efficient, neuromorphic SPAD imaging systems with reduced data overhead and enhanced real-time processing capabilities.

Abstract: Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are widely used today in time-resolved
imaging applications. However, traditional architectures rely on
time-to-digital converters (TDCs) and histogram-based processing, leading to
significant data transfer and processing challenges. Previous work based on
recurrent neural networks has realized histogram-free processing. To further
address these limitations, we propose a novel paradigm that eliminates TDCs by
integrating in-sensor spike encoders. This approach enables preprocessing of
photon arrival events in the sensor while significantly compressing data,
reducing complexity, and maintaining real-time edge processing capabilities. A
dedicated spike encoder folds multiple laser repetition periods, transforming
phase-based spike trains into density-based spike trains optimized for spiking
neural network processing and training via backpropagation through time. As a
proof of concept, we introduce Transporter, a 128$\times$4 SPAD sensor with a
per-pixel D flip-flop ring-based spike encoder, designed for intelligent active
time-resolved imaging. This work demonstrates a path toward more efficient,
neuromorphic SPAD imaging systems with reduced data overhead and enhanced
real-time processing.
