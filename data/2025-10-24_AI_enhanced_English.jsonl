With the advent of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new\nparadigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven\nand generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of\nrecent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically\nanalyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology\nengineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.\n  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual\nfoundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two\ncomplementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,\nnormalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight\nflexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize\nrepresentative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify\ntheir limitations.\n  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,\nincluding KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic\nsystems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim\nto clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging\nsymbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the\ndevelopment of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "This survey examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming knowledge graph construction from traditional rule-based approaches to language-driven generative frameworks, covering both schema-based and schema-free paradigms.", "motivation": "The emergence of LLMs has created a paradigm shift in knowledge graph construction, moving from rule-based and statistical pipelines to more flexible, language-driven approaches that can better handle complex knowledge representation.", "method": "The survey systematically analyzes LLM-empowered KG construction through a three-layered pipeline: ontology engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion, examining both schema-based (structured, normalized) and schema-free (flexible, adaptive) paradigms.", "result": "The review synthesizes representative frameworks, analyzes their technical mechanisms, and identifies limitations in current LLM-driven KG construction approaches across different stages of the pipeline.", "conclusion": "The survey outlines future directions including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic systems, and multimodal KG construction, aiming to bridge symbolic knowledge engineering with neural semantic understanding for adaptive, explainable intelligent systems."}}
