*Hari Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TbVAD is a language-driven framework for weakly supervised video anomaly detection that performs detection and explanation entirely in the textual domain using vision-language models and structured semantic knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an interpretable video anomaly detection system that moves beyond conventional visual feature-based approaches by leveraging language representations for knowledge-grounded reasoning and explainable anomaly detection.

Method: Three-stage framework: (1) transform video content into fine-grained captions using vision-language models, (2) organize captions into four semantic slots (action, object, context, environment), (3) generate slot-wise explanations identifying which semantic factors contribute most to anomaly decisions.

Result: Evaluated on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks, demonstrating that textual knowledge reasoning provides interpretable and reliable anomaly detection for real-world surveillance scenarios.

Conclusion: TbVAD successfully enables interpretable video anomaly detection through language-based representation and structured semantic reasoning, offering a novel approach to explainable anomaly detection in surveillance applications.

Abstract: We introduce Text-based Explainable Video Anomaly Detection (TbVAD), a language-driven framework for weakly supervised video anomaly detection that performs anomaly detection and explanation entirely within the textual domain. Unlike conventional WSVAD models that rely on explicit visual features, TbVAD represents video semantics through language, enabling interpretable and knowledge-grounded reasoning. The framework operates in three stages: (1) transforming video content into fine-grained captions using a vision-language model, (2) constructing structured knowledge by organizing the captions into four semantic slots (action, object, context, environment), and (3) generating slot-wise explanations that reveal which semantic factors contribute most to the anomaly decision. We evaluate TbVAD on two public benchmarks, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, demonstrating that textual knowledge reasoning provides interpretable and reliable anomaly detection for real-world surveillance scenarios.

*Joe Kileel,Oscar Mickelin,Amit Singer,Sheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoDM is a cryo-EM data fusion framework that uses second-order moments from two datasets with different orientation distributions to uniquely determine molecular structures, enabling accurate recovery through convex optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cryo-EM reconstruction by leveraging multiple datasets with different experimental conditions, specifically different orientation distributions, to enhance reconstruction quality through data fusion.

Method: Method of double moments (MoDM) that fuses second-order moments from two datasets: one with uniform orientation distribution and another with unknown non-uniform distribution, using convex-relaxation-based optimization.

Result: The method generically uniquely determines molecular structures (up to global rotation/reflection) and achieves accurate recovery using only second-order statistics, demonstrating improved reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: Leveraging dataset diversity through multiple experimental conditions substantially enhances cryo-EM reconstruction quality, showing the value of data fusion approaches in computational imaging.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful imaging technique for reconstructing three-dimensional molecular structures from noisy tomographic projection images of randomly oriented particles. We introduce a new data fusion framework, termed the method of double moments (MoDM), which reconstructs molecular structures from two instances of the second-order moment of projection images obtained under distinct orientation distributions--one uniform, the other non-uniform and unknown. We prove that these moments generically uniquely determine the underlying structure, up to a global rotation and reflection, and we develop a convex-relaxation-based algorithm that achieves accurate recovery using only second-order statistics. Our results demonstrate the advantage of collecting and modeling multiple datasets under different experimental conditions, illustrating that leveraging dataset diversity can substantially enhance reconstruction quality in computational imaging tasks.

### [3] [Modulo Video Recovery via Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07479)
*Tianyu Geng,Feng Ji,Wee Peng Tay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSViT is a novel Transformer-based deep learning framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance in modulo video recovery by using selective token processing to efficiently reconstruct high-quality videos from 8-bit folded inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional image sensors have limited dynamic range causing saturation in HDR scenes. Modulo cameras address this by folding irradiance but require specialized unwrapping algorithms. Despite being introduced over a decade ago, progress in modulo image recovery has been slow, especially with modern deep learning techniques.

Method: Presented Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer (SSViT), which employs a token selection strategy to improve efficiency and concentrate on critical regions. It captures global dependencies and spatial-temporal relationships crucial for resolving folded video frames.

Result: SSViT produces high-quality reconstructions from 8-bit folded videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance in modulo video recovery, confirming its effectiveness through experiments.

Conclusion: Transformers with selective token processing can effectively solve modulo video recovery, demonstrating that standard HDR methods are unsuitable while SSViT provides an efficient and high-performing solution.

Abstract: Conventional image sensors have limited dynamic range, causing saturation in high-dynamic-range (HDR) scenes. Modulo cameras address this by folding incident irradiance into a bounded range, yet require specialized unwrapping algorithms to reconstruct the underlying signal. Unlike HDR recovery, which extends dynamic range from conventional sampling, modulo recovery restores actual values from folded samples. Despite being introduced over a decade ago, progress in modulo image recovery has been slow, especially in the use of modern deep learning techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that standard HDR methods are unsuitable for modulo recovery. Transformers, however, can capture global dependencies and spatial-temporal relationships crucial for resolving folded video frames. Still, adapting existing Transformer architectures for modulo recovery demands novel techniques. To this end, we present Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer (SSViT), the first deep learning framework for modulo video reconstruction. SSViT employs a token selection strategy to improve efficiency and concentrate on the most critical regions. Experiments confirm that SSViT produces high-quality reconstructions from 8-bit folded videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance in modulo video recovery.

### [4] [Laplacian Score Sharpening for Mitigating Hallucination in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07496)
*Barath Chandran. C,Srinivas Anumasa,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a post-hoc adjustment to diffusion model score functions using Laplacian-based correction to reduce mode interpolation hallucinations during sampling, with efficient implementation for high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from hallucinations creating incoherent samples due to mode interpolation and score smoothening, but existing methods lack prevention mechanisms during sampling.

Method: Post-hoc adjustment to score function using Laplacian (sharpness) of the score, with efficient Laplacian approximation for high dimensions using finite-difference variant of Hutchinson trace estimator.

Result: Significantly reduces rate of hallucinated samples across toy 1D/2D distributions and high-dimensional image datasets.

Conclusion: Laplacian-based correction effectively reduces mode interpolation hallucinations in diffusion models, with analysis showing relationship between Laplacian and score uncertainty.

Abstract: Diffusion models, though successful, are known to suffer from hallucinations that create incoherent or unrealistic samples. Recent works have attributed this to the phenomenon of mode interpolation and score smoothening, but they lack a method to prevent their generation during sampling. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc adjustment to the score function during inference that leverages the Laplacian (or sharpness) of the score to reduce mode interpolation hallucination in unconditional diffusion models across 1D, 2D, and high-dimensional image data. We derive an efficient Laplacian approximation for higher dimensions using a finite-difference variant of the Hutchinson trace estimator. We show that this correction significantly reduces the rate of hallucinated samples across toy 1D/2D distributions and a high- dimensional image dataset. Furthermore, our analysis explores the relationship between the Laplacian and uncertainty in the score.

### [5] [Toward the Frontiers of Reliable Diffusion Sampling via Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07499)
*Kwanyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASAG is a novel guidance method for diffusion models that uses adversarial optimal transport to disrupt attention mechanisms, improving sample quality without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guidance methods like CFG rely on heuristic perturbations that lack principled foundations and manually designed distortions.

Method: ASAG reinterprets attention scores through optimal transport lens and injects adversarial cost in self-attention layers using Sinkhorn algorithm to reduce pixel-wise similarity between queries and keys.

Result: ASAG shows consistent improvements in text-to-image diffusion, enhances controllability and fidelity in downstream applications like IP-Adapter and ControlNet.

Conclusion: The method is lightweight, plug-and-play, improves reliability without requiring model retraining, and provides a principled alternative to heuristic guidance approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative performance when using guidance methods such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), which enhance output quality by modifying the sampling trajectory. These methods typically improve a target output by intentionally degrading another, often the unconditional output, using heuristic perturbation functions such as identity mixing or blurred conditions. However, these approaches lack a principled foundation and rely on manually designed distortions. In this work, we propose Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance (ASAG), a novel method that reinterprets attention scores in diffusion models through the lens of optimal transport and intentionally disrupt the transport cost via Sinkhorn algorithm. Instead of naively corrupting the attention mechanism, ASAG injects an adversarial cost within self-attention layers to reduce pixel-wise similarity between queries and keys. This deliberate degradation weakens misleading attention alignments and leads to improved conditional and unconditional sample quality. ASAG shows consistent improvements in text-to-image diffusion, and enhances controllability and fidelity in downstream applications such as IP-Adapter and ControlNet. The method is lightweight, plug-and-play, and improves reliability without requiring any model retraining.

*Hristo Dimitrov,Giulia Dominijanni,Viktorija Pavalkyte,Tamar R. Makin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrackStudio is an accessible GUI-based toolkit that combines established open-source tools for markerless motion tracking, enabling non-experts to perform automatic 2D/3D tracking, calibration, and analysis without programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a gap in accessible, integrated solutions for markerless motion tracking that don't require substantial technical expertise, limiting adoption by non-experts across diverse research and clinical settings.

Method: Combines established open-source tools into a single modular GUI-based pipeline with automatic 2D/3D tracking, calibration, preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualization. Includes user guide with practical advice for video setup and common pitfalls.

Result: Validated across 76 participants in challenging conditions, achieving average inter-frame correlations >0.98 and triangulation errors <13.6mm for hand tracking. The pipeline extends to other body and face regions.

Conclusion: TrackStudio provides a practical, accessible route into markerless tracking for researchers and laypeople needing reliable performance without specialist expertise, bridging the accessibility gap in motion tracking technology.

Abstract: Markerless motion tracking has advanced rapidly in the past 10 years and currently offers powerful opportunities for behavioural, clinical, and biomechanical research. While several specialised toolkits provide high performance for specific tasks, using existing tools still requires substantial technical expertise. There remains a gap in accessible, integrated solutions that deliver sufficient tracking for non-experts across diverse settings.
  TrackStudio was developed to address this gap by combining established open-source tools into a single, modular, GUI-based pipeline that works out of the box. It provides automatic 2D and 3D tracking, calibration, preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualisation without requiring any programming skills. We supply a user guide with practical advice for video acquisition, synchronisation, and setup, alongside documentation of common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
  To validate the toolkit, we tested its performance across three environments using either low-cost webcams or high-resolution cameras, including challenging conditions for body position, lightning, and space and obstructions. Across 76 participants, average inter-frame correlations exceeded 0.98 and average triangulation errors remained low (<13.6mm for hand tracking), demonstrating stable and consistent tracking. We further show that the same pipeline can be extended beyond hand tracking to other body and face regions. TrackStudio provides a practical, accessible route into markerless tracking for researchers or laypeople who need reliable performance without specialist expertise.

### [8] [Predicting Coronary Artery Calcium Severity based on Non-Contrast Cardiac CT images using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07695)
*Lachlan Nguyen,Aidan Cousins,Arcot Sowmya,Hugh Dixson,Sonit Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning CNN model achieves 96.5% accuracy in classifying coronary artery calcium scores into six clinical categories from cardiac CT images, showing high agreement with semiautomatic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coronary artery calcium scoring requires time-intensive semiautomatic analysis by radiologists, creating a need for automated methods to improve efficiency in cardiovascular disease risk stratification.

Method: Developed a deep learning convolutional neural network model using 68 patient cardiac CT scans with semiautomatic calcium scores as reference labels, divided into training, validation and test sets.

Result: Model achieved 96.5% accuracy, Cohen's kappa of 0.962, with 32 misclassifications out of total cases (tending to overestimate in 26/32 misclassifications), demonstrating high generalizability.

Conclusion: The CNN model is viable for stratifying calcium scores into six clinical categories, providing accurate and consistent results comparable to current semiautomatic practice with good generalizability.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease causes high rates of mortality worldwide. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is a powerful tool to stratify the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Current scoring practices require time-intensive semiautomatic analysis of cardiac computed tomography by radiologists and trained radiographers. The purpose of this study is to develop a deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) model to classify the calcium score in cardiac, non-contrast computed tomography images into one of six clinical categories. A total of 68 patient scans were retrospectively obtained together with their respective reported semiautomatic calcium score using an ECG-gated GE Discovery 570 Cardiac SPECT/CT camera. The dataset was divided into training, validation and test sets. Using the semiautomatic CAC score as the reference label, the model demonstrated high performance on a six-class CAC scoring categorisation task. Of the scans analysed, the model misclassified 32 cases, tending towards overestimating the CAC in 26 out of 32 misclassifications. Overall, the model showed high agreement (Cohen's kappa of 0.962), an overall accuracy of 96.5% and high generalisability. The results suggest that the model outputs were accurate and consistent with current semiautomatic practice, with good generalisability to test data. The model demonstrates the viability of a CNN model to stratify the calcium score into an expanded set of six clinical categories.

*Nikita Araslanov,Anna Sonnweber,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowFeat is a high-resolution, multi-task feature representation that uses novel distillation of apparent motion profiles to enhance dense prediction tasks, significantly improving state-of-the-art encoders across video segmentation, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art networks like transformers produce low-resolution feature grids that are suboptimal for dense prediction tasks, creating a need for high-resolution representations.

Method: Developed FlowFeat using a novel distillation technique that embeds distribution of plausible apparent motions (motion profiles) by leveraging optical flow networks and diverse video data in a self-supervised training framework.

Result: FlowFeat significantly enhances representational power of five state-of-the-art encoders and alternative upsampling strategies across three dense tasks, with high temporal consistency and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: FlowFeat advances reliable and versatile dense image representations, remaining effective even with unsupervised flow networks and robust to inaccurate flow estimation.

Abstract: Dense and versatile image representations underpin the success of virtually all computer vision applications. However, state-of-the-art networks, such as transformers, produce low-resolution feature grids, which are suboptimal for dense prediction tasks. To address this limitation, we present FlowFeat, a high-resolution and multi-task feature representation. The key ingredient behind FlowFeat is a novel distillation technique that embeds a distribution of plausible apparent motions, or motion profiles. By leveraging optical flow networks and diverse video data, we develop an effective self-supervised training framework that statistically approximates the apparent motion. With its remarkable level of spatial detail, FlowFeat encodes a compelling degree of geometric and semantic cues while exhibiting high temporal consistency. Empirically, FlowFeat significantly enhances the representational power of five state-of-the-art encoders and alternative upsampling strategies across three dense tasks: video object segmentation, monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation. Training FlowFeat is computationally inexpensive and robust to inaccurate flow estimation, remaining highly effective even when using unsupervised flow networks. Our work takes a step forward towards reliable and versatile dense image representations.

### [10] [Cross Modal Fine-grained Alignment via Granularity-aware and Region-uncertain Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07710)
*Jiale Liu,Haoming Zhou,Yishu Zhu,Bingzhi Chen,Yuncheng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a unified approach for fine-grained image-text alignment using significance-aware modeling and Gaussian mixture distributions to capture uncertainty, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Flickr30K and MS-COCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack robust intra-modal mechanisms to assess token significance and fail to model fine-grained uncertainty in region-word correspondences, leading to poor generalization in complex scenes.

Method: Incorporates significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling with region-level uncertainty modeling using modality-specific biases and Gaussian mixture distributions for region features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across various backbone architectures on Flickr30K and MS-COCO datasets, enhancing robustness and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed unified approach effectively addresses limitations in fine-grained image-text alignment by modeling significance and uncertainty, demonstrating superior performance and improved generalization.

Abstract: Fine-grained image-text alignment is a pivotal challenge in multimodal learning, underpinning key applications such as visual question answering, image captioning, and vision-language navigation. Unlike global alignment, fine-grained alignment requires precise correspondence between localized visual regions and textual tokens, often hindered by noisy attention mechanisms and oversimplified modeling of cross-modal relationships. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing approaches: the lack of robust intra-modal mechanisms to assess the significance of visual and textual tokens, leading to poor generalization in complex scenes; and the absence of fine-grained uncertainty modeling, which fails to capture the one-to-many and many-to-one nature of region-word correspondences. To address these issues, we propose a unified approach that incorporates significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling and region-level uncertainty modeling. Our method leverages modality-specific biases to identify salient features without relying on brittle cross-modal attention, and represents region features as a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture fine-grained uncertainty. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various backbone architectures, significantly enhancing the robustness and interpretability of fine-grained image-text alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a model that can synthesize satellite imagery conditioned on precise vector geometry annotations, enabling spatially grounded edits and interactive workflows for geographic analysis.

Method: Uses a vision language alignment module to produce pixel-level embeddings from polygon semantics, which guide a conditional image generation framework to respect spatial extents and semantic cues.

Result: Shows strong improvements over prior methods in semantic fidelity and structural realism, with the trained vision language model demonstrating fine-grained spatial grounding.

Conclusion: VectorSynth enables interactive workflows for rapid what-if simulations, spatial edits, and map-informed content generation with pixel-level accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce VectorSynth, a diffusion-based framework for pixel-accurate satellite image synthesis conditioned on polygonal geographic annotations with semantic attributes. Unlike prior text- or layout-conditioned models, VectorSynth learns dense cross-modal correspondences that align imagery and semantic vector geometry, enabling fine-grained, spatially grounded edits. A vision language alignment module produces pixel-level embeddings from polygon semantics; these embeddings guide a conditional image generation framework to respect both spatial extents and semantic cues. VectorSynth supports interactive workflows that mix language prompts with geometry-aware conditioning, allowing rapid what-if simulations, spatial edits, and map-informed content generation. For training and evaluation, we assemble a collection of satellite scenes paired with pixel-registered polygon annotations spanning diverse urban scenes with both built and natural features. We observe strong improvements over prior methods in semantic fidelity and structural realism, and show that our trained vision language model demonstrates fine-grained spatial grounding.

### [14] [Class Incremental Medical Image Segmentation via Prototype-Guided Calibration and Dual-Aligned Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07749)
*Shengqian Zhu,Chengrong Yu,Qiang Wang,Ying Song,Guangjun Li,Jiafei Wu,Xiaogang Xu,Zhang Yi,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PGCD and DAPD methods for class incremental medical image segmentation to better preserve old knowledge while learning new classes without old-class labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either treat all regions/channels equally or focus only on global prototype alignment, leading to knowledge degradation in old classes.

Method: PGCD uses prototype-to-feature similarity to calibrate class-specific distillation intensity, while DAPD aligns local prototypes with both global and local representations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multi-organ segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating robustness and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed prototype-guided calibration and dual-aligned distillation effectively mitigate knowledge degradation in class incremental medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Class incremental medical image segmentation (CIMIS) aims to preserve knowledge of previously learned classes while learning new ones without relying on old-class labels. However, existing methods 1) either adopt one-size-fits-all strategies that treat all spatial regions and feature channels equally, which may hinder the preservation of accurate old knowledge, 2) or focus solely on aligning local prototypes with global ones for old classes while overlooking their local representations in new data, leading to knowledge degradation. To mitigate the above issues, we propose Prototype-Guided Calibration Distillation (PGCD) and Dual-Aligned Prototype Distillation (DAPD) for CIMIS in this paper. Specifically, PGCD exploits prototype-to-feature similarity to calibrate class-specific distillation intensity in different spatial regions, effectively reinforcing reliable old knowledge and suppressing misleading information from old classes. Complementarily, DAPD aligns the local prototypes of old classes extracted from the current model with both global prototypes and local prototypes, further enhancing segmentation performance on old categories. Comprehensive evaluations on two widely used multi-organ segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its robustness and generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: Filtered-ViT integrates SMART Vector Median Filtering to defend against multiple adversarial patches while maintaining clean accuracy, showing effectiveness in both synthetic attacks and real-world medical imaging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning vision systems are vulnerable to multiple adversarial patches, especially in safety-critical domains like healthcare, where existing single-patch defenses fail against real-world multi-patch scenarios.

Method: Proposes Filtered-ViT architecture with SMART Vector Median Filtering (SMART-VMF) - a spatially adaptive, multi-scale mechanism that selectively suppresses corrupted regions while preserving semantic details.

Result: On ImageNet with LaVAN multi-patch attacks: 79.8% clean accuracy and 46.3% robust accuracy under four simultaneous 1% patches, outperforming existing defenses. Real-world medical imaging case study shows mitigation of natural artifacts without degrading diagnostic content.

Conclusion: Filtered-ViT is the first transformer demonstrating unified robustness against both adversarial and natural patch-like disruptions, enabling reliable vision systems in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Deep learning vision systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains such as healthcare, yet they remain vulnerable to small adversarial patches that can trigger misclassifications. Most existing defenses assume a single patch and fail when multiple localized disruptions occur, the type of scenario adversaries and real-world artifacts often exploit. We propose Filtered-ViT, a new vision transformer architecture that integrates SMART Vector Median Filtering (SMART-VMF), a spatially adaptive, multi-scale, robustness-aware mechanism that enables selective suppression of corrupted regions while preserving semantic detail. On ImageNet with LaVAN multi-patch attacks, Filtered-ViT achieves 79.8% clean accuracy and 46.3% robust accuracy under four simultaneous 1\% patches, outperforming existing defenses. Beyond synthetic benchmarks, a real-world case study on radiographic medical imagery shows that Filtered-ViT mitigates natural artifacts such as occlusions and scanner noise without degrading diagnostic content. This establishes Filtered-ViT as the first transformer to demonstrate unified robustness against both adversarial and naturally occurring patch-like disruptions, charting a path toward reliable vision systems in truly high-stakes environments.

Motivation: To challenge the conventional view that initial noise in diffusion models is purely random and contributes only to diversity, and to demonstrate that noise actually contains rich semantic information that can be manipulated for better content generation.

Method: A two-step "Semantic Erasure-Injection" process: 1) Erase unwanted semantics from noise using information theory principles, 2) Inject desired semantics by leveraging the equivalence between diffusion generation process and semantic injection. The method is training-free and universal.

Result: Experimental results show the method is consistently effective across various text-to-content models based on both DiT and UNet architectures, providing improved generation control and consistency.

Conclusion: The work presents a novel perspective for optimizing diffusion model generation by revealing and leveraging the semantic patterns in initial noise, providing a universal tool for consistent content generation.

Abstract: In text-driven content generation (T2C) diffusion model, semantic of generated content is mostly attributed to the process of text embedding and attention mechanism interaction. The initial noise of the generation process is typically characterized as a random element that contributes to the diversity of the generated content. Contrary to this view, this paper reveals that beneath the random surface of noise lies strong analyzable patterns. Specifically, this paper first conducts a comprehensive analysis of the impact of random noise on the model's generation. We found that noise not only contains rich semantic information, but also allows for the erasure of unwanted semantics from it in an extremely simple way based on information theory, and using the equivalence between the generation process of diffusion model and semantic injection to inject semantics into the cleaned noise. Then, we mathematically decipher these observations and propose a simple but efficient training-free and universal two-step "Semantic Erasure-Injection" process to modulate the initial noise in T2C diffusion model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is consistently effective across various T2C models based on both DiT and UNet architectures and presents a novel perspective for optimizing the generation of diffusion model, providing a universal tool for consistent generation.

*Likang Peng,Chao Su,Wenyuan Wu,Yuan Sun,Dezhong Peng,Xi Peng,Xu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCBCH is a cross-modal hashing framework that addresses label noise and semantic overlap issues in multi-label datasets through semantic-consistent classification and bidirectional soft contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-modal hashing methods rely on fully annotated datasets and are vulnerable to label noise in real-world multi-label scenarios, while also ignoring partial semantic overlaps that limit robustness.

Method: Proposes SCBCH with two modules: Cross-modal Semantic-Consistent Classification (CSCC) to estimate sample reliability and reduce noisy label impact, and Bidirectional Soft Contrastive Hashing (BSCH) for adaptive contrastive learning using soft sample pairs based on semantic overlap.

Result: Extensive experiments on four cross-modal retrieval benchmarks show SCBCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under noisy multi-label conditions.

Conclusion: SCBCH effectively handles label noise and semantic overlap in multi-label cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating superior robustness and performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Cross-modal hashing (CMH) facilitates efficient retrieval across different modalities (e.g., image and text) by encoding data into compact binary representations. While recent methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often rely heavily on fully annotated datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to obtain. In real-world scenarios, particularly in multi-label datasets, label noise is prevalent and severely degrades retrieval performance. Moreover, existing CMH approaches typically overlook the partial semantic overlaps inherent in multi-label data, limiting their robustness and generalization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing (SCBCH). The framework comprises two complementary modules: (1) Cross-modal Semantic-Consistent Classification (CSCC), which leverages cross-modal semantic consistency to estimate sample reliability and reduce the impact of noisy labels; (2) Bidirectional Soft Contrastive Hashing (BSCH), which dynamically generates soft contrastive sample pairs based on multi-label semantic overlap, enabling adaptive contrastive learning between semantically similar and dissimilar samples across modalities. Extensive experiments on four widely-used cross-modal retrieval benchmarks validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under noisy multi-label conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCDNet proposes a novel approach for cross-domain few-shot segmentation that addresses feature entanglement through adversarial-contrastive decomposition and adaptive fusion modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Encoder features often entangle domain-relevant and category-relevant information, limiting cross-domain generalization and rapid adaptation to new domains with limited annotations.

Method: Proposes DCDNet with three key modules: Adversarial-Contrastive Feature Decomposition (ACFD) to decouple features, Matrix-Guided Dynamic Fusion (MGDF) to adaptively integrate features, and Cross-Adaptive Modulation (CAM) for enhanced generalization during fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets show that DCDNet outperforms existing CD-FSS methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for cross-domain generalization and few-shot adaptation.

Conclusion: The proposed DCDNet effectively addresses feature entanglement in cross-domain few-shot segmentation through decomposition and adaptive fusion strategies, achieving superior performance across multiple domains.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to tackle the dual challenge of recognizing novel classes and adapting to unseen domains with limited annotations. However, encoder features often entangle domain-relevant and category-relevant information, limiting both generalization and rapid adaptation to new domains. To address this issue, we propose a Divide-and-Conquer Decoupled Network (DCDNet). In the training stage, to tackle feature entanglement that impedes cross-domain generalization and rapid adaptation, we propose the Adversarial-Contrastive Feature Decomposition (ACFD) module. It decouples backbone features into category-relevant private and domain-relevant shared representations via contrastive learning and adversarial learning. Then, to mitigate the potential degradation caused by the disentanglement, the Matrix-Guided Dynamic Fusion (MGDF) module adaptively integrates base, shared, and private features under spatial guidance, maintaining structural coherence. In addition, in the fine-tuning stage, to enhanced model generalization, the Cross-Adaptive Modulation (CAM) module is placed before the MGDF, where shared features guide private features via modulation ensuring effective integration of domain-relevant information. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets show that DCDNet outperforms existing CD-FSS methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for cross-domain generalization and few-shot adaptation.

TL;DR: A strong multilabel chest X-ray classification pipeline using SE-ResNeXt101 with Label-Graph Refinement module that learns inter-label relationships to improve performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective and practical multilabel classification system for chest X-rays that addresses challenges like class imbalance, asymmetric error costs, and label co-occurrence patterns.

Method: Fine-tuned SE-ResNeXt101 backbone with sigmoid head, trained using Multilabel Iterative Stratification, Asymmetric Loss, mixed-precision training, and a novel Label-Graph Refinement module that learns sparse inter-label coupling matrix for logit refinement.

Result: The baseline SE-ResNeXt101 achieved 92.64% macro AUC, and adding Label-Graph Refinement consistently improved validation macro AUC across folds with negligible computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a reproducible, hardware-friendly approach for stronger multilabel CXR classifiers without requiring extra annotations, offering practical improvements through label relationship modeling.

Abstract: We study multilabel classification of chest X-rays and present a simple, strong pipeline built on SE-ResNeXt101 $(32 \times 4d)$. The backbone is finetuned for 14 thoracic findings with a sigmoid head, trained using Multilabel Iterative Stratification (MIS) for robust cross-validation splits that preserve label co-occurrence. To address extreme class imbalance and asymmetric error costs, we optimize with Asymmetric Loss, employ mixed-precision (AMP), cosine learning-rate decay with warm-up, gradient clipping, and an exponential moving average (EMA) of weights. We propose a lightweight Label-Graph Refinement module placed after the classifier: given per-label probabilities, it learns a sparse, trainable inter-label coupling matrix that refines logits via a single message-passing step while adding only an L1-regularized parameter head. At inference, we apply horizontal flip test-time augmentation (TTA) and average predictions across MIS folds (a compact deep ensemble). Evaluation uses macro AUC averaging classwise ROC-AUC and skipping single-class labels in a fold to reflect balanced performance across conditions. On our dataset, a strong SE-ResNeXt101 baseline attains competitive macro AUC (e.g., 92.64% in our runs). Adding the Label-Graph Refinement consistently improves validation macro AUC across folds with negligible compute. The resulting method is reproducible, hardware-friendly, and requires no extra annotations, offering a practical route to stronger multilabel CXR classifiers.

TL;DR: PC-Diffusion is a lightweight framework that uses a trainable Preference Classifier to align diffusion models with human preferences, avoiding expensive full model fine-tuning and reference model dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DPO methods for diffusion models have high computational costs due to full model fine-tuning and are sensitive to reference model quality, causing instability and bias.

Method: Proposes a trainable Preference Classifier that directly models relative preferences between samples, decoupling preference alignment from the generative model without requiring full model fine-tuning or reference models.

Result: PC-Diffusion achieves comparable preference consistency to DPO while significantly reducing training costs and enabling efficient, stable preference-guided generation.

Conclusion: PC-Diffusion provides a computationally efficient and stable alternative to DPO for human preference alignment in diffusion models, with theoretical guarantees for preference propagation and progressive steering toward preferred outputs.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in conditional image generation, yet their outputs often remain misaligned with human preferences. To address this, recent work has applied Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to diffusion models, yielding significant improvements.~However, DPO-like methods exhibit two key limitations: 1) High computational cost,due to the entire model fine-tuning; 2) Sensitivity to reference model quality}, due to its tendency to introduce instability and bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework for human preference alignment in diffusion models (PC-Diffusion), using a lightweight, trainable Preference Classifier that directly models the relative preference between samples. By restricting preference learning to this classifier, PC-Diffusion decouples preference alignment from the generative model, eliminating the need for entire model fine-tuning and reference model reliance.~We further provide theoretical guarantees for PC-Diffusion:1) PC-Diffusion ensures that the preference-guided distributions are consistently propagated across timesteps. 2)The training objective of the preference classifier is equivalent to DPO, but does not require a reference model.3) The proposed preference-guided correction can progressively steer generation toward preference-aligned regions.~Empirical results show that PC-Diffusion achieves comparable preference consistency to DPO while significantly reducing training costs and enabling efficient and stable preference-guided generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAR classification methods rely heavily on supervised learning with extensive labeled data, limiting scalability, generalization, and adaptability to diverse applications.

Method: Proposed Dynamic Instance and Contour Consistency Contrastive Learning (DI3CL) framework with DI module for global contextual awareness and CC module for geometric contour focus, pre-trained on SARSense dataset of 460,532 SAR images.

Result: Extensive experiments across SAR land-cover mapping, water body detection, and road extraction tasks consistently show DI3CL outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: The foundation model serves as a robust cornerstone for accelerating downstream SAR classification model development and deployment, with publicly available code and pre-trained weights.

Abstract: Although significant advances have been achieved in SAR land-cover classification, recent methods remain predominantly focused on supervised learning, which relies heavily on extensive labeled datasets. This dependency not only limits scalability and generalization but also restricts adaptability to diverse application scenarios. In this paper, a general-purpose foundation model for SAR land-cover classification is developed, serving as a robust cornerstone to accelerate the development and deployment of various downstream models. Specifically, a Dynamic Instance and Contour Consistency Contrastive Learning (DI3CL) pre-training framework is presented, which incorporates a Dynamic Instance (DI) module and a Contour Consistency (CC) module. DI module enhances global contextual awareness by enforcing local consistency across different views of the same region. CC module leverages shallow feature maps to guide the model to focus on the geometric contours of SAR land-cover objects, thereby improving structural discrimination. Additionally, to enhance robustness and generalization during pre-training, a large-scale and diverse dataset named SARSense, comprising 460,532 SAR images, is constructed to enable the model to capture comprehensive and representative features. To evaluate the generalization capability of our foundation model, we conducted extensive experiments across a variety of SAR land-cover classification tasks, including SAR land-cover mapping, water body detection, and road extraction. The results consistently demonstrate that the proposed DI3CL outperforms existing methods. Our code and pre-trained weights are publicly available at: https://github.com/SARpre-train/DI3CL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mismatch between discrete token outputs of MLLMs and continuous quality scores in IQA tasks causes performance issues, with previous conversion methods suffering from errors and semantic confusion from level tokens.

Method: Proposes Q-Scorer framework with a lightweight regression module and IQA-specific score tokens integrated into the MLLM pipeline, based on theoretical analysis of previous errors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple IQA benchmarks, generalizes well to mixed datasets, and shows further improvement when combined with other methods.

Conclusion: Q-Scorer effectively bridges the gap between MLLM discrete outputs and continuous IQA requirements, enhancing performance while maintaining MLLM capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid progress of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has boosted the task of image quality assessment (IQA). However, a key challenge arises from the inherent mismatch between the discrete token outputs of MLLMs and the continuous nature of quality scores required by IQA tasks. This discrepancy significantly hinders the performance of MLLM-based IQA methods. Previous approaches that convert discrete token predictions into continuous scores often suffer from conversion errors. Moreover, the semantic confusion introduced by level tokens (e.g., ``good'') further constrains the performance of MLLMs on IQA tasks and degrades their original capabilities for related tasks. To tackle these problems, we provide a theoretical analysis of the errors inherent in previous approaches and, motivated by this analysis, propose a simple yet effective framework, Q-Scorer. This framework incorporates a lightweight regression module and IQA-specific score tokens into the MLLM pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Scorer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple IQA benchmarks, generalizes well to mixed datasets, and further improves when combined with other methods.

Conclusion: Sparse3DPR demonstrates robust performance and generalization capability in real-world scenarios, offering an efficient training-free solution for 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been explored widely for 3D scene understanding. Among them, training-free approaches are gaining attention for their flexibility and generalization over training-based methods. However, they typically struggle with accuracy and efficiency in practical deployment. To address the problems, we propose Sparse3DPR, a novel training-free framework for open-ended scene understanding, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and requires only sparse-view RGB inputs. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical plane-enhanced scene graph that supports open vocabulary and adopts dominant planar structures as spatial anchors, which enables clearer reasoning chains and more reliable high-level inferences. Furthermore, we design a task-adaptive subgraph extraction method to filter query-irrelevant information dynamically, reducing contextual noise and improving 3D scene reasoning efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Sparse3DPR, which achieves a 28.7% EM@1 improvement and a 78.2% speedup compared with ConceptGraphs on the Space3D-Bench. Moreover, Sparse3DPR obtains comparable performance to training-based methods on ScanQA, with additional real-world experiments confirming its robustness and generalization capability.

Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for prostate cancer lesion segmentation achieve limited performance (Dice scores ≤0.32), necessitating better imaging modalities to enhance segmentation accuracy.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation across six state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using 200 patients with co-registered CDI$^s$, DWI and ADC sequences, comparing performance with and without CDI$^s$ integration.

Result: CDI$^s$ integration enhances or preserves segmentation performance in 94% of configurations, with up to 72.5% relative improvement. CDI$^s$ + DWI achieves significant improvements in half of architectures with zero degradation instances.

Conclusion: CDI$^s$ provides a practical drop-in enhancement for prostate cancer lesion segmentation that can be immediately deployed in clinical workflows since it derives from existing DWI acquisitions without additional scan time or architectural modifications.

Abstract: Current deep learning approaches for prostate cancer lesion segmentation achieve limited performance, with Dice scores of 0.32 or lower in large patient cohorts. To address this limitation, we investigate synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$) as an enhancement to standard diffusion-based protocols. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across six state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using 200 patients with co-registered CDI$^s$, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences. We demonstrate that CDI$^s$ integration reliably enhances or preserves segmentation performance in 94% of evaluated configurations, with individual architectures achieving up to 72.5% statistically significant relative improvement over baseline modalities. CDI$^s$ + DWI emerges as the safest enhancement pathway, achieving significant improvements in half of evaluated architectures with zero instances of degradation. Since CDI$^s$ derives from existing DWI acquisitions without requiring additional scan time or architectural modifications, it enables immediate deployment in clinical workflows. Our results establish validated integration pathways for CDI$^s$ as a practical drop-in enhancement for PCa lesion segmentation tasks across diverse deep learning architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional radar-based heartbeat sensing suffers from noise degradation, while learning-based methods require expensive labeled data. There's a need for unsupervised approaches that maintain noise robustness without costly supervision.

Method: Uses heartbeat range and noise range in radar range matrix to create positive/negative samples. Employs Noise-Contrastive Triplet (NCT) loss with pseudo-labels from traditional radar methods. Includes pseudo-label augmentation with adaptive noise-aware label selection.

Result: Extensive experiments on Equipleth dataset and collected radar dataset show the unsupervised method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods.

Conclusion: Radar-APLANC provides an effective unsupervised solution for radar heartbeat sensing that eliminates dependency on expensive ground-truth physiological signals while maintaining strong noise robustness.

Abstract: Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars can measure subtle chest wall oscillations to enable non-contact heartbeat sensing. However, traditional radar-based heartbeat sensing methods face performance degradation due to noise. Learning-based radar methods achieve better noise robustness but require costly labeled signals for supervised training. To overcome these limitations, we propose the first unsupervised framework for radar-based heartbeat sensing via Augmented Pseudo-Label and Noise Contrast (Radar-APLANC). We propose to use both the heartbeat range and noise range within the radar range matrix to construct the positive and negative samples, respectively, for improved noise robustness. Our Noise-Contrastive Triplet (NCT) loss only utilizes positive samples, negative samples, and pseudo-label signals generated by the traditional radar method, thereby avoiding dependence on expensive ground-truth physiological signals. We further design a pseudo-label augmentation approach featuring adaptive noise-aware label selection to improve pseudo-label signal quality. Extensive experiments on the Equipleth dataset and our collected radar dataset demonstrate that our unsupervised method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods.

Conclusion: The SSOMotion framework successfully integrates scene semantics with structure for improved human motion synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art results while reducing computational redundancy.

Abstract: Human motion synthesis in 3D scenes relies heavily on scene comprehension, while current methods focus mainly on scene structure but ignore the semantic understanding. In this paper, we propose a human motion synthesis framework that take an unified Scene Semantic Occupancy (SSO) for scene representation, termed SSOMotion. We design a bi-directional tri-plane decomposition to derive a compact version of the SSO, and scene semantics are mapped to an unified feature space via CLIP encoding and shared linear dimensionality reduction. Such strategy can derive the fine-grained scene semantic structures while significantly reduce redundant computations. We further take these scene hints and movement direction derived from instructions for motion control via frame-wise scene query. Extensive experiments and ablation studies conducted on cluttered scenes using ShapeNet furniture, as well as scanned scenes from PROX and Replica datasets, demonstrate its cutting-edge performance while validating its effectiveness and generalization ability.

Motivation: Existing Mamba-based point cloud methods suffer from imperfect point cloud serialization, insufficient high-level geometric perception, and overfitting of the selective state space model (S6).

Method: Proposes sequence expanding (serializes points along each axis separately) and sequence merging (fuses higher-order features from different sequences), chainedMamba for bidirectional processing, and grouped selective state space model (GS6) with parameter sharing.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on various point cloud tasks with significantly less complexity compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CloudMamba effectively addresses the key challenges in adapting Mamba for point cloud analysis and demonstrates superior performance with reduced computational complexity.

Abstract: Due to the long-range modeling ability and linear complexity property, Mamba has attracted considerable attention in point cloud analysis. Despite some interesting progress, related work still suffers from imperfect point cloud serialization, insufficient high-level geometric perception, and overfitting of the selective state space model (S6) at the core of Mamba. To this end, we resort to an SSM-based point cloud network termed CloudMamba to address the above challenges. Specifically, we propose sequence expanding and sequence merging, where the former serializes points along each axis separately and the latter serves to fuse the corresponding higher-order features causally inferred from different sequences, enabling unordered point sets to adapt more stably to the causal nature of Mamba without parameters. Meanwhile, we design chainedMamba that chains the forward and backward processes in the parallel bidirectional Mamba, capturing high-level geometric information during scanning. In addition, we propose a grouped selective state space model (GS6) via parameter sharing on S6, alleviating the overfitting problem caused by the computational mode in S6. Experiments on various point cloud tasks validate CloudMamba's ability to achieve state-of-the-art results with significantly less complexity.

Motivation: Traditional radar-based indoor 3D pose estimation requires costly fine-grained 3D keypoint labels, which are difficult to obtain in complex indoor environments with clutter, occlusions, or multiple people.

Method: Two-stage pose decoder with pseudo-3D deformable attention: pose decoder estimates initial 3D poses using 3D template loss with BBox labels, and joint decoder refines poses using 2D keypoint labels and 3D gravity loss.

Conclusion: RAPTR demonstrates effective 3D human pose estimation using only weakly supervised labels, making radar-based pose estimation more scalable and practical for indoor applications.

Abstract: Radar-based indoor 3D human pose estimation typically relied on fine-grained 3D keypoint labels, which are costly to obtain especially in complex indoor settings involving clutter, occlusions, or multiple people. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RAPTR} (RAdar Pose esTimation using tRansformer) under weak supervision, using only 3D BBox and 2D keypoint labels which are considerably easier and more scalable to collect. Our RAPTR is characterized by a two-stage pose decoder architecture with a pseudo-3D deformable attention to enhance (pose/joint) queries with multi-view radar features: a pose decoder estimates initial 3D poses with a 3D template loss designed to utilize the 3D BBox labels and mitigate depth ambiguities; and a joint decoder refines the initial poses with 2D keypoint labels and a 3D gravity loss. Evaluated on two indoor radar datasets, RAPTR outperforms existing methods, reducing joint position error by $34.3\%$ on HIBER and $76.9\%$ on MMVR.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D object detection suffers from ill-posed depth and limited field of view, causing lack of geometric cues and reduced accuracy in occluded or truncated scenes. Current approaches overlook visual cues crucial for robust recognition.

Method: 1) K-means clustering on visual features to capture distinct object-level appearance parts; 2) Construct generalized scene memory by aggregating clustered features across images; 3) Integrate both local cluster features and scene memory into object queries to guide attention.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark, enabling robust monocular 3D detection under occlusion and limited visibility.

Conclusion: The unified local clustering and generalized scene memory strategy provides consistent representations that generalize across scenes, improving object-level feature consistency for stable detection in varying environments.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection offers a cost-effective solution for autonomous driving but suffers from ill-posed depth and limited field of view. These constraints cause a lack of geometric cues and reduced accuracy in occluded or truncated scenes. While recent approaches incorporate additional depth information to address geometric ambiguity, they overlook the visual cues crucial for robust recognition. We propose MonoCLUE, which enhances monocular 3D detection by leveraging both local clustering and generalized scene memory of visual features. First, we perform K-means clustering on visual features to capture distinct object-level appearance parts (e.g., bonnet, car roof), improving detection of partially visible objects. The clustered features are propagated across regions to capture objects with similar appearances. Second, we construct a generalized scene memory by aggregating clustered features across images, providing consistent representations that generalize across scenes. This improves object-level feature consistency, enabling stable detection across varying environments. Lastly, we integrate both local cluster features and generalized scene memory into object queries, guiding attention toward informative regions. Exploiting a unified local clustering and generalized scene memory strategy, MonoCLUE enables robust monocular 3D detection under occlusion and limited visibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework represents a significant step towards general-purpose visual perception and provides a solid foundation for universal vision modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in isolated computer vision tasks such as text-to-image generation, depth estimation, and optical flow. However, these models are often restricted by a ``single-task-single-model'' paradigm, severely limiting their generalizability and scalability in multi-task scenarios. Motivated by the cross-domain generalization ability of large language models, we propose a universal visual perception framework based on flow matching that can generate diverse visual representations across multiple tasks. Our approach formulates the process as a universal flow-matching problem from image patch tokens to task-specific representations rather than an independent generation or regression problem. By leveraging a strong self-supervised foundation model as the anchor and introducing a multi-scale, circular task embedding mechanism, our method learns a universal velocity field to bridge the gap between heterogeneous tasks, supporting efficient and flexible representation transfer. Extensive experiments on classification, detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and image-text retrieval demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, outperforming prior generalist and several specialist models. Ablation studies further validate the robustness, scalability, and generalization of our framework. Our work marks a significant step towards general-purpose visual perception, providing a solid foundation for future research in universal vision modeling.

### [31] [Generating Sketches in a Hierarchical Auto-Regressive Process for Flexible Sketch Drawing Manipulation at Stroke-Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07889)
*Sicong Zang,Shuhui Gao,Zhijun Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generation method that allows flexible stroke-level manipulation during generation, unlike previous methods that require all conditions to be set before generation starts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sketch generation methods require all stroke-level conditions to be set before generation begins, preventing further manipulation during the drawing process. The goal is to enable more flexible sketch manipulation.

Method: Hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generation with three stages: 1) predict stroke embedding, 2) anchor stroke on canvas, 3) translate embedding to drawing actions. All stages proceed auto-regressively considering previously generated strokes and positions.

Result: Enables flexible manipulation of stroke-level sketch drawing at any time during generation by adjusting editable stroke embeddings, providing more control over the sketch generation process.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical auto-regressive approach successfully addresses the limitation of pre-set conditions in sketch generation, allowing real-time manipulation and more flexible control over sketch creation.

Abstract: Generating sketches with specific patterns as expected, i.e., manipulating sketches in a controllable way, is a popular task. Recent studies control sketch features at stroke-level by editing values of stroke embeddings as conditions. However, in order to provide generator a global view about what a sketch is going to be drawn, all these edited conditions should be collected and fed into generator simultaneously before generation starts, i.e., no further manipulation is allowed during sketch generating process. In order to realize sketch drawing manipulation more flexibly, we propose a hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generating process. Instead of generating an entire sketch at once, each stroke in a sketch is generated in a three-staged hierarchy: 1) predicting a stroke embedding to represent which stroke is going to be drawn, and 2) anchoring the predicted stroke on the canvas, and 3) translating the embedding to a sequence of drawing actions to form the full sketch. Moreover, the stroke prediction, anchoring and translation are proceeded auto-regressively, i.e., both the recently generated strokes and their positions are considered to predict the current one, guiding model to produce an appropriate stroke at a suitable position to benefit the full sketch generation. It is flexible to manipulate stroke-level sketch drawing at any time during generation by adjusting the exposed editable stroke embeddings.

*Narendra Singh Yadav,Pavan Kumar Perepu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis of text polarity detection phenomenon in image binarization, explaining why maximum between-class variance increases for dark text on bright background and decreases for bright text on dark background after power-law transformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide theoretical foundation for an empirical observation in text polarity detection for image binarization, which is crucial preprocessing for applications like license plate recognition, captcha recognition, and character recognition.

Method: Theoretical analysis of the phenomenon observed in power-law transformation approach, where maximum between-class variance between text and background classes shows systematic behavior based on text polarity.

Result: Developed theoretical explanation for why between-class variance increases for dark text on bright background and decreases for bright text on dark background after power-law transformation.

Conclusion: The paper provides mathematical justification for the empirical observation in text polarity detection, enhancing understanding of the fundamental principles behind image binarization preprocessing.

Abstract: Several computer vision applications like vehicle license plate recognition, captcha recognition, printed or handwriting character recognition from images etc., text polarity detection and binarization are the important preprocessing tasks. To analyze any image, it has to be converted to a simple binary image. This binarization process requires the knowledge of polarity of text in the images. Text polarity is defined as the contrast of text with respect to background. That means, text is darker than the background (dark text on bright background) or vice-versa. The binarization process uses this polarity information to convert the original colour or gray scale image into a binary image. In the literature, there is an intuitive approach based on power-law transformation on the original images. In this approach, the authors have illustrated an interesting phenomenon from the histogram statistics of the transformed images. Considering text and background as two classes, they have observed that maximum between-class variance between two classes is increasing (decreasing) for dark (bright) text on bright (dark) background. The corresponding empirical results have been presented. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of the above phenomenon.

Conclusion: The proposed Earth2Ocean framework successfully bridges the terrestrial-underwater domain gap without additional training, enabling effective marine organism segmentation for biodiversity monitoring applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of marine organisms is vital for biodiversity monitoring and ecological assessment, yet existing datasets and models remain largely limited to terrestrial scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{AquaOV255}, the first large-scale and fine-grained underwater segmentation dataset containing 255 categories and over 20K images, covering diverse categories for open-vocabulary (OV) evaluation. Furthermore, we establish the first underwater OV segmentation benchmark, \textbf{UOVSBench}, by integrating AquaOV255 with five additional underwater datasets to enable comprehensive evaluation. Alongside, we present \textbf{Earth2Ocean}, a training-free OV segmentation framework that transfers terrestrial vision--language models (VLMs) to underwater domains without any additional underwater training. Earth2Ocean consists of two core components: a Geometric-guided Visual Mask Generator (\textbf{GMG}) that refines visual features via self-similarity geometric priors for local structure perception, and a Category-visual Semantic Alignment (\textbf{CSA}) module that enhances text embeddings through multimodal large language model reasoning and scene-aware template construction. Extensive experiments on the UOVSBench benchmark demonstrate that Earth2Ocean achieves significant performance improvement on average while maintaining efficient inference.

TL;DR: HD²-SSC framework addresses dimension and density gaps in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion for autonomous driving through semantic decoupling and occupancy refinement modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSC methods suffer from dimension gap (2D input vs 3D output) and density gap (sparse annotations vs real-world dense occupancy), leading to inferior predictions.

Method: Proposes HD²-SSC with two modules: 1) High-dimension Semantic Decoupling expands 2D features along pseudo third dimension and identifies focal regions; 2) High-density Occupancy Refinement uses detect-and-refine architecture to complete missing voxels and correct erroneous ones.

Result: Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: HD²-SSC successfully bridges dimension and density gaps in 3D semantic scene completion, improving scene understanding for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, enabling voxelized 3D scene understanding for effective scene perception and decision-making. Existing SSC methods have shown efficacy in improving 3D scene representations, but suffer from the inherent input-output dimension gap and annotation-reality density gap, where the 2D planner view from input images with sparse annotated labels leads to inferior prediction of real-world dense occupancy with a 3D stereoscopic view. In light of this, we propose the corresponding High-Dimension High-Density Semantic Scene Completion (HD$^2$-SSC) framework with expanded pixel semantics and refined voxel occupancies. To bridge the dimension gap, a High-dimension Semantic Decoupling module is designed to expand 2D image features along a pseudo third dimension, decoupling coarse pixel semantics from occlusions, and then identify focal regions with fine semantics to enrich image features. To mitigate the density gap, a High-density Occupancy Refinement module is devised with a "detect-and-refine" architecture to leverage contextual geometric and semantic structures for enhanced semantic density with the completion of missing voxels and correction of erroneous ones. Extensive experiments and analyses on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets validate the effectiveness of our HD$^2$-SSC framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 2D images cannot distinguish terrain depth features like craters and hills, which significantly impact path safety. A disparity map-based approach is needed for safer navigation.

Method: Uses disparity maps generated from UAV images, applies computer vision techniques (edge/line/corner detection, stereo depth reconstruction) to define way-points. Uses ArUco markers for automatic start/end point detection.

Result: Algorithm successfully tested in V-REP simulations and laboratory physical setup, showing effectiveness compared to A* and PRM algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed image-based path planning algorithm using disparity maps and computer vision techniques is effective and shows promising results for safe navigation in complex terrains.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel image-based path planning algorithm that was developed using computer vision techniques, as well as its comparative analysis with well-known deterministic and probabilistic algorithms, namely A* and Probabilistic Road Map algorithm (PRM). The terrain depth has a significant impact on the calculated path safety. The craters and hills on the surface cannot be distinguished in a two-dimensional image. The proposed method uses a disparity map of the terrain that is generated by using a UAV. Several computer vision techniques, including edge, line and corner detection methods, as well as the stereo depth reconstruction technique, are applied to the captured images and the found disparity map is used to define candidate way-points of the trajectory. The initial and desired points are detected automatically using ArUco marker pose estimation and circle detection techniques. After presenting the mathematical model and vision techniques, the developed algorithm is compared with well-known algorithms on different virtual scenes created in the V-REP simulation program and a physical setup created in a laboratory environment. Results are promising and demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedMedCLIP is a federated learning approach using CLIP for medical image classification that reduces communication and computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in medical imaging by enabling decentralized training without sharing source data, while overcoming data heterogeneity and high resource costs of vision language models in federated learning.

Method: Uses masked feature adaptation module for communication, freezes CLIP encoders, employs masked MLP as local classifier, adaptive KL divergence-based distillation, and model compression with ensemble predictions.

Result: Achieves 8% higher performance than second best baseline on ISIC2019 dataset and 120x faster training than FedAVG with reasonable resource costs.

Conclusion: FedMedCLIP provides an effective federated learning solution for medical image classification that balances performance with practical resource constraints.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of deep models in medical imaging, they still require source data for training, which limits their potential in light of privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL), as a decentralized learning framework that trains a shared model with multiple hospitals (a.k.a., FL clients), provides a feasible solution. However, data heterogeneity and resource costs hinder the deployment of FL models, especially when using vision language models (VLM). To address these challenges, we propose a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) based FL approach for medical image classification (FedMedCLIP). Specifically, we introduce a masked feature adaptation module (FAM) as a communication module to reduce the communication load while freezing the CLIP encoders to reduce the computational overhead. Furthermore, we propose a masked multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as a private local classifier to adapt to the client tasks. Moreover, we design an adaptive Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based distillation regularization method to enable mutual learning between FAM and MLP. Finally, we incorporate model compression to transmit the FAM parameters while using ensemble predictions for classification. Extensive experiments on four publicly available medical datasets demonstrate that our model provides feasible performance (e.g., 8\% higher compared to second best baseline on ISIC2019) with reasonable resource cost (e.g., 120$\times$ faster than FedAVG).

TL;DR: Proposes Laytrol Network for layout-to-image generation that preserves pretrained model knowledge by using base model-synthesized data and parameter inheritance from MM-DiT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing layout-to-image methods suffer from low visual quality and stylistic inconsistency with base models due to loss of pretrained knowledge when integrating layout conditions.

Method: Constructs LaySyn dataset using base model-synthesized images to reduce distribution shift. Proposes Laytrol Network that inherits MM-DiT parameters, uses text encoder initialization for layout encoder, zero initialization for outputs, and Object-level Rotary Position Embedding.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness in generating spatially consistent images while maintaining visual quality and style consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the challenge of spatial controllability in text-to-image generation while preserving pretrained model knowledge through careful parameter inheritance and initialization strategies.

Abstract: With the development of diffusion models, enhancing spatial controllability in text-to-image generation has become a vital challenge. As a representative task for addressing this challenge, layout-to-image generation aims to generate images that are spatially consistent with the given layout condition. Existing layout-to-image methods typically introduce the layout condition by integrating adapter modules into the base generative model. However, the generated images often exhibit low visual quality and stylistic inconsistency with the base model, indicating a loss of pretrained knowledge. To alleviate this issue, we construct the Layout Synthesis (LaySyn) dataset, which leverages images synthesized by the base model itself to mitigate the distribution shift from the pretraining data. Moreover, we propose the Layout Control (Laytrol) Network, in which parameters are inherited from MM-DiT to preserve the pretrained knowledge of the base model. To effectively activate the copied parameters and avoid disturbance from unstable control conditions, we adopt a dedicated initialization scheme for Laytrol. In this scheme, the layout encoder is initialized as a pure text encoder to ensure that its output tokens remain within the data domain of MM-DiT. Meanwhile, the outputs of the layout control network are initialized to zero. In addition, we apply Object-level Rotary Position Embedding to the layout tokens to provide coarse positional information. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: DiffRegCD is a unified framework that integrates dense registration and change detection in a single model, achieving sub-pixel accuracy and robust performance under large displacements and viewpoint variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world imagery often exhibits parallax, viewpoint shifts, and long temporal gaps causing severe misalignment, which traditional two-stage methods and recent joint frameworks struggle with under large displacements.

Method: Reformulates correspondence estimation as Gaussian smoothed classification task, leverages frozen multi-scale features from pretrained denoising diffusion model, and uses controlled affine perturbations on standard CD datasets for supervision without pseudo labels.

Result: Extensive experiments on aerial and ground-level datasets show DiffRegCD consistently surpasses recent baselines and remains reliable under wide temporal and geometric variation.

Conclusion: Diffusion features and classification-based correspondence establish a strong foundation for unified change detection, providing robust performance in challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is fundamental to computer vision and remote sensing, supporting applications in environmental monitoring, disaster response, and urban development. Most CD models assume co-registered inputs, yet real-world imagery often exhibits parallax, viewpoint shifts, and long temporal gaps that cause severe misalignment. Traditional two stage methods that first register and then detect, as well as recent joint frameworks (e.g., BiFA, ChangeRD), still struggle under large displacements, relying on regression only flow, global homographies, or synthetic perturbations. We present DiffRegCD, an integrated framework that unifies dense registration and change detection in a single model. DiffRegCD reformulates correspondence estimation as a Gaussian smoothed classification task, achieving sub-pixel accuracy and stable training. It leverages frozen multi-scale features from a pretrained denoising diffusion model, ensuring robustness to illumination and viewpoint variation. Supervision is provided through controlled affine perturbations applied to standard CD datasets, yielding paired ground truth for both flow and change detection without pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on aerial (LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD) and ground level (VL-CMU-CD) datasets show that DiffRegCD consistently surpasses recent baselines and remains reliable under wide temporal and geometric variation, establishing diffusion features and classification based correspondence as a strong foundation for unified change detection.

TL;DR: ISExplore is a segment selection strategy that identifies informative 5-second video segments for talking face generation, achieving 5x faster processing while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TFG methods require minutes of reference video fitting which takes hours, limiting practical applications. Exploratory studies show short informative segments can achieve comparable or better performance than full videos.

Method: Proposes ISExplore strategy that automatically selects 5-second informative segments based on three quality dimensions: audio feature diversity, lip movement amplitude, and number of camera views.

Result: Increases data processing and training speed by more than 5x for NeRF and 3DGS methods while maintaining high-fidelity output quality.

Conclusion: Video informative quality is more important than length, and the proposed ISExplore enables efficient TFG with significantly reduced computational burden.

Abstract: Talking Face Generation (TFG) aims to produce realistic and dynamic talking portraits, with broad applications in fields such as digital education, film and television production, e-commerce live streaming, and other related areas. Currently, TFG methods based on Neural Radiated Field (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian sputtering (3DGS) are received widespread attention. They learn and store personalized features from reference videos of each target individual to generate realistic speaking videos. To ensure models can capture sufficient 3D information and successfully learns the lip-audio mapping, previous studies usually require meticulous processing and fitting several minutes of reference video, which always takes hours. The computational burden of processing and fitting long reference videos severely limits the practical application value of these methods.However, is it really necessary to fit such minutes of reference video? Our exploratory case studies show that using some informative reference video segments of just a few seconds can achieve performance comparable to or even better than the full reference video. This indicates that video informative quality is much more important than its length. Inspired by this observation, we propose the ISExplore (short for Informative Segment Explore), a simple-yet-effective segment selection strategy that automatically identifies the informative 5-second reference video segment based on three key data quality dimensions: audio feature diversity, lip movement amplitude, and number of camera views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach increases data processing and training speed by more than 5x for NeRF and 3DGS methods, while maintaining high-fidelity output.

TL;DR: Proposes Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning for computational pathology, using bidirectional interaction between vision and language modalities with task-specific pathological entity prototypes to enhance generalization and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational cost challenges in giga-pixel Whole Slide Images and bias in LLM-generated instance-level descriptions due to lack of fine-grained medical knowledge, while overcoming limitations of unidirectional guidance in existing vision-language MIL methods.

Method: Leverages frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions as text prototypes, learns instance-level vision prototypes, and uses Stereoscopic Optimal Transport algorithm for fusion to enable bidirectional interaction and semantic alignment.

Result: Demonstrates superior generalization capabilities in few-shot classification and explainability experiments on three distinct cancer datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses computational pathology challenges by promoting bidirectional multimodal interaction through prototype learning and optimal transport fusion, achieving improved generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a promising direction in computational pathology, the substantial computational cost of giga-pixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) necessitates the use of Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) to enable effective modeling. A key challenge is that pathological tasks typically provide only bag-level labels, while instance-level descriptions generated by LLMs often suffer from bias due to a lack of fine-grained medical knowledge. To address this, we propose that constructing task-specific pathological entity prototypes is crucial for learning generalizable features and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, existing vision-language MIL methods often employ unidirectional guidance, limiting cross-modal synergy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning, that promotes bidirectional interaction through a balanced information compression scheme. Specifically, we leverage a frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions, which are learned as text prototypes. Concurrently, the vision branch learns instance-level prototypes to mitigate the model's reliance on redundant data. For the fusion stage, we employ the Stereoscopic Optimal Transport (SOT) algorithm, which is based on a similarity metric, thereby facilitating broader semantic alignment in a higher-dimensional space. We conduct few-shot classification and explainability experiments on three distinct cancer datasets, and the results demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of our proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability issues of Transformer-based ReID methods (quadratic memory/computation growth) while maintaining robust discriminative feature extraction capabilities.

Method: Proposes Mamba-based baseline with multiple class tokens, multi-granularity feature extractor (MGFE) with multi-branch architecture, and ranking-aware triplet regularization (RATR) for feature diversity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on five person ReID benchmarks with only one-third parameters of TransReID, lower GPU memory usage, and faster inference throughput.

Conclusion: ReIDMamba successfully demonstrates Mamba's effectiveness for ReID, offering superior performance with significantly reduced computational requirements compared to Transformer-based approaches.

Abstract: Extracting robust discriminative features is a critical challenge in person re-identification (ReID). While Transformer-based methods have successfully addressed some limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as their local processing nature and information loss resulting from convolution and downsampling operations, they still face the scalability issue due to the quadratic increase in memory and computational requirements with the length of the input sequence. To overcome this, we propose a pure Mamba-based person ReID framework named ReIDMamba. Specifically, we have designed a Mamba-based strong baseline that effectively leverages fine-grained, discriminative global features by introducing multiple class tokens. To further enhance robust features learning within Mamba, we have carefully designed two novel techniques. First, the multi-granularity feature extractor (MGFE) module, designed with a multi-branch architecture and class token fusion, effectively forms multi-granularity features, enhancing both discrimination ability and fine-grained coverage. Second, the ranking-aware triplet regularization (RATR) is introduced to reduce redundancy in features from multiple branches, enhancing the diversity of multi-granularity features by incorporating both intra-class and inter-class diversity constraints, thus ensuring the robustness of person features. To our knowledge, this is the pioneering work that integrates a purely Mamba-driven approach into ReID research. Our proposed ReIDMamba model boasts only one-third the parameters of TransReID, along with lower GPU memory usage and faster inference throughput. Experimental results demonstrate ReIDMamba's superior and promising performance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on five person ReID benchmarks.

Conclusion: BuIQA effectively addresses burst image redundancy by providing task-driven quality assessment, enabling better frame selection and improving downstream task performance.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of burst imaging technology has improved the capture and processing capabilities of visual data, enabling a wide range of applications. However, the redundancy in burst images leads to the increased storage and transmission demands, as well as reduced efficiency of downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a new task of Burst Image Quality Assessment (BuIQA), to evaluate the task-driven quality of each frame within a burst sequence, providing reasonable cues for burst image selection. Specifically, we establish the first benchmark dataset for BuIQA, consisting of $7,346$ burst sequences with $45,827$ images and $191,572$ annotated quality scores for multiple downstream scenarios. Inspired by the data analysis, a unified BuIQA framework is proposed to achieve an efficient adaption for BuIQA under diverse downstream scenarios. Specifically, a task-driven prompt generation network is developed with heterogeneous knowledge distillation, to learn the priors of the downstream task. Then, the task-aware quality assessment network is introduced to assess the burst image quality based on the task prompt. Extensive experiments across 10 downstream scenarios demonstrate the impressive BuIQA performance of the proposed approach, outperforming the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, it can achieve $0.33$ dB PSNR improvement in the downstream tasks of denoising and super-resolution, by applying our approach to select the high-quality burst frames.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D UDA methods using teacher-student architecture with pseudo labels have shown improvements, but they largely ignore the usefulness of image data that is often collected simultaneously with point clouds.

Method: Projects labels to images to get 2D boxes, extracts image features from pre-trained vision backbone, uses LVLM for text descriptions and text encoder for text features, aligns 3D features with image/text features, fuses them with learned weights, and enhances pseudo labels with 2D detector.

Result: Achieves promising performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in three domain adaptation tasks on three popular 3D object detection datasets.

Conclusion: Multi-modal assistance using image and text features effectively improves 3D UDA performance for LiDAR-based object detection.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation for LiDAR-based 3D object detection (3D UDA) based on the teacher-student architecture with pseudo labels has achieved notable improvements in recent years. Although it is quite popular to collect point clouds and images simultaneously, little attention has been paid to the usefulness of image data in 3D UDA when training the models. In this paper, we propose an approach named MMAssist that improves the performance of 3D UDA with multi-modal assistance. A method is designed to align 3D features between the source domain and the target domain by using image and text features as bridges. More specifically, we project the ground truth labels or pseudo labels to the images to get a set of 2D bounding boxes. For each 2D box, we extract its image feature from a pre-trained vision backbone. A large vision-language model (LVLM) is adopted to extract the box's text description, and a pre-trained text encoder is used to obtain its text feature. During the training of the model in the source domain and the student model in the target domain, we align the 3D features of the predicted boxes with their corresponding image and text features, and the 3D features and the aligned features are fused with learned weights for the final prediction. The features between the student branch and the teacher branch in the target domain are aligned as well. To enhance the pseudo labels, we use an off-the-shelf 2D object detector to generate 2D bounding boxes from images and estimate their corresponding 3D boxes with the aid of point cloud, and these 3D boxes are combined with the pseudo labels generated by the teacher model. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in three domain adaptation tasks on three popular 3D object detection datasets.

Motivation: Remote sensing change detection faces challenges with spatial misalignment in bi-temporal images, especially with long seasonal or multi-year gaps. Existing models rely on precise co-registration and perform poorly in real-world conditions, while joint frameworks require retraining and lack cross-domain transferability.

Method: The framework integrates diffusion-based semantic morphing, dense registration, and residual flow refinement. A diffusion module synthesizes intermediate morphing frames to bridge appearance gaps, enabling stepwise correspondence estimation. The composed flow is refined through a lightweight U-Net to produce high-fidelity warps for co-registration.

Result: Extensive experiments on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and DSIFN-CD datasets show consistent gains in both registration accuracy and downstream change detection across multiple backbones, demonstrating the approach's generality and effectiveness.

Conclusion: RoMa provides a robust solution for handling spatial misalignment in remote sensing change detection without requiring modifications to existing detection networks, offering improved performance across various datasets and backbone architectures.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is often challenged by spatial misalignment between bi-temporal images, especially when acquisitions are separated by long seasonal or multi-year gaps. While modern convolutional and transformer-based models perform well on aligned data, their reliance on precise co-registration limits their robustness in real-world conditions. Existing joint registration-detection frameworks typically require retraining and transfer poorly across domains. We introduce a modular pipeline that improves spatial and temporal robustness without altering existing change detection networks. The framework integrates diffusion-based semantic morphing, dense registration, and residual flow refinement. A diffusion module synthesizes intermediate morphing frames that bridge large appearance gaps, enabling RoMa to estimate stepwise correspondences between consecutive frames. The composed flow is then refined through a lightweight U-Net to produce a high-fidelity warp that co-registers the original image pair. Extensive experiments on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and DSIFN-CD show consistent gains in both registration accuracy and downstream change detection across multiple backbones, demonstrating the generality and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DANCE is a density-agnostic and class-aware network for point cloud completion that preserves observed geometry while completing only missing regions using ray-based sampling and transformer refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud completion methods assume fixed input/output densities or rely on image-based representations, making them unsuitable for real-world scenarios with variable sparsity and limited supervision.

Method: Generates candidate points via ray-based sampling from multiple viewpoints, uses transformer decoder to refine positions and predict opacity scores, and incorporates semantic guidance through lightweight classification head on geometric features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on PCN and MVP benchmarks in accuracy and structural consistency, while remaining robust to varying input densities and noise levels.

Conclusion: DANCE provides an effective framework for category-consistent point cloud completion without external image supervision, handling real-world challenges like variable sparsity.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover missing geometric structures from incomplete 3D scans, which often suffer from occlusions or limited sensor viewpoints. Existing methods typically assume fixed input/output densities or rely on image-based representations, making them less suitable for real-world scenarios with variable sparsity and limited supervision. In this paper, we introduce Density-agnostic and Class-aware Network (DANCE), a novel framework that completes only the missing regions while preserving the observed geometry. DANCE generates candidate points via ray-based sampling from multiple viewpoints. A transformer decoder then refines their positions and predicts opacity scores, which determine the validity of each point for inclusion in the final surface. To incorporate semantic guidance, a lightweight classification head is trained directly on geometric features, enabling category-consistent completion without external image supervision. Extensive experiments on the PCN and MVP benchmarks show that DANCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and structural consistency, while remaining robust to varying input densities and noise levels.

Conclusion: The proposed semantic-guided framework effectively addresses large-mask inpainting challenges by providing better structural and semantic guidance, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across diverse masking conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a semantic-guided framework to address the challenging problem of large-mask image inpainting, where essential visual content is missing and contextual cues are limited. To compensate for the limited context, we leverage a pretrained Amodal Completion (AC) model to generate structure-aware candidates that serve as semantic priors for the missing regions. We introduce Context-Semantic Fusion Network (CSF-Net), a transformer-based fusion framework that fuses these candidates with contextual features to produce a semantic guidance image for image inpainting. This guidance improves inpainting quality by promoting structural accuracy and semantic consistency. CSF-Net can be seamlessly integrated into existing inpainting models without architectural changes and consistently enhances performance across diverse masking conditions. Extensive experiments on the Places365 and COCOA datasets demonstrate that CSF-Net effectively reduces object hallucination while enhancing visual realism and semantic alignment.

Motivation: Current VideoLLMs suffer from quadratic computational complexity and key-value cache scaling due to processing excessive redundant visual tokens, which limits their efficiency and scalability.

Method: SharpV uses adaptive pruning of visual tokens and KV cache with dynamic adjustment of pruning ratios based on spatial-temporal information. It employs a two-stage pruning framework: first pruning visual tokens, then pruning degraded KV cache features via self-calibration guided by similarity to original visual features.

Result: Experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate SharpV's superiority. Remarkably, the adaptive mechanism occasionally achieves performance gains over dense models, and the method is fully compatible with hardware acceleration techniques like Flash Attention.

Abstract: Current Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) suffer from quadratic computational complexity and key-value cache scaling, due to their reliance on processing excessive redundant visual tokens. To address this problem, we propose SharpV, a minimalist and efficient method for adaptive pruning of visual tokens and KV cache. Different from most uniform compression approaches, SharpV dynamically adjusts pruning ratios based on spatial-temporal information. Remarkably, this adaptive mechanism occasionally achieves performance gains over dense models, offering a novel paradigm for adaptive pruning. During the KV cache pruning stage, based on observations of visual information degradation, SharpV prunes degraded visual features via a self-calibration manner, guided by similarity to original visual features. In this way, SharpV achieves hierarchical cache pruning from the perspective of information bottleneck, offering a new insight into VideoLLMs' information flow. Experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SharpV. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, SharpV is notably the first two-stage pruning framework that operates without requiring access to exposed attention scores, ensuring full compatibility with hardware acceleration techniques like Flash Attention.

Conclusion: EAGLE's memory consolidation mechanism effectively handles appearance variations and enables efficient unification of 2D and 3D visual query localization tasks.

Abstract: Egocentric visual query localization is vital for embodied AI and VR/AR, yet remains challenging due to camera motion, viewpoint changes, and appearance variations. We present EAGLE, a novel framework that leverages episodic appearance- and geometry-aware memory to achieve unified 2D-3D visual query localization in egocentric vision. Inspired by avian memory consolidation, EAGLE synergistically integrates segmentation guided by an appearance-aware meta-learning memory (AMM), with tracking driven by a geometry-aware localization memory (GLM). This memory consolidation mechanism, through structured appearance and geometry memory banks, stores high-confidence retrieval samples, effectively supporting both long- and short-term modeling of target appearance variations. This enables precise contour delineation with robust spatial discrimination, leading to significantly improved retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, by integrating the VQL-2D output with a visual geometry grounded Transformer (VGGT), we achieve a efficient unification of 2D and 3D tasks, enabling rapid and accurate back-projection into 3D space. Our method achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the Ego4D-VQ benchmark.

*Jian Wang,Lijun He,Yixing Yong,Haixia Bi,Fan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvRoad generates natural-looking adversarial road posters that fool 3D object detectors into seeing non-existent objects, making attacks stealthy and effective in autonomous driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial attacks on autonomous driving systems use unnatural-looking posters that are easily detectable by humans and can be defended against. There's a need for more realistic and stealthy attacks to better understand safety vulnerabilities.

Method: Two-stage approach: Road-Style Adversary Generation creates natural road-like appearances, and Scenario-Associated Adaptation optimizes attack effectiveness for specific scenes while maintaining stealth.

Result: AdvRoad successfully fools various 3D object detectors across different scenes and locations. Physical experiments confirm real-world effectiveness, demonstrating practical threats to autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: AdvRoad presents a significant security threat to autonomous driving by creating stealthy, natural-looking adversarial attacks that bypass human detection while effectively compromising 3D object detectors.

Abstract: Modern autonomous driving (AD) systems leverage 3D object detection to perceive foreground objects in 3D environments for subsequent prediction and planning. Visual 3D detection based on RGB cameras provides a cost-effective solution compared to the LiDAR paradigm. While achieving promising detection accuracy, current deep neural network-based models remain highly susceptible to adversarial examples. The underlying safety concerns motivate us to investigate realistic adversarial attacks in AD scenarios. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of placing adversarial posters on the road surface to induce hallucinations in the detector. However, the unnatural appearance of the posters makes them easily noticeable by humans, and their fixed content can be readily targeted and defended. To address these limitations, we propose the AdvRoad to generate diverse road-style adversarial posters. The adversaries have naturalistic appearances resembling the road surface while compromising the detector to perceive non-existent objects at the attack locations. We employ a two-stage approach, termed Road-Style Adversary Generation and Scenario-Associated Adaptation, to maximize the attack effectiveness on the input scene while ensuring the natural appearance of the poster, allowing the attack to be carried out stealthily without drawing human attention. Extensive experiments show that AdvRoad generalizes well to different detectors, scenes, and spoofing locations. Moreover, physical attacks further demonstrate the practical threats in real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection requires expensive annotated datasets. ISOD trains on synthetic data but faces issues with poor synthetic data quality, DETR convergence problems, and overfitting to noisy pseudo-labels.

Method: Uses LLaMA-3, Flux, and Grounding DINO to create high-quality synthetic datasets (FluxVOC/FluxCOCO). Introduces High-Quality Proposal guided query encoding with SAM proposals and RoI-pooled features. Implements cascade denoising with progressive IoU thresholds across decoder layers.

Result: Achieves SOTA 61.04% mAP@0.5 on PASCAL VOC 2007 after only 12 epochs on FluxVOC, outperforming strong baselines and demonstrating competitive real-data performance.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively addresses ISOD limitations and shows universal applicability through improved convergence, reduced overfitting, and better real-world generalization.

Abstract: Object detection models demand large-scale annotated datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to create. This motivated Imaginary Supervised Object Detection (ISOD), where models train on synthetic images and test on real images. However, existing methods face three limitations: (1) synthetic datasets suffer from simplistic prompts, poor image quality, and weak supervision; (2) DETR-based detectors, due to their random query initialization, struggle with slow convergence and overfitting to synthetic patterns, hindering real-world generalization; (3) uniform denoising pressure promotes model overfitting to pseudo-label noise. We propose Cascade HQP-DETR to address these limitations. First, we introduce a high-quality data pipeline using LLaMA-3, Flux, and Grounding DINO to generate the FluxVOC and FluxCOCO datasets, advancing ISOD from weak to full supervision. Second, our High-Quality Proposal guided query encoding initializes object queries with image-specific priors from SAM-generated proposals and RoI-pooled features, accelerating convergence while steering the model to learn transferable features instead of overfitting to synthetic patterns. Third, our cascade denoising algorithm dynamically adjusts training weights through progressively increasing IoU thresholds across decoder layers, guiding the model to learn robust boundaries from reliable visual cues rather than overfitting to noisy labels. Trained for just 12 epochs solely on FluxVOC, Cascade HQP-DETR achieves a SOTA 61.04\% mAP@0.5 on PASCAL VOC 2007, outperforming strong baselines, with its competitive real-data performance confirming the architecture's universal applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of unimodal deepfake detection methods by leveraging cross-modal correlations and achieving precise temporal localization against sophisticated manipulations.

Method: Uses pre-trained WavLM (audio) and CLIP (video) models for feature extraction, constructs multi-scale feature pyramid with R-TLM blocks and localized attention, and employs dual-branch prediction for forgery probabilities and temporal offset refinement.

Result: Achieved final score of 0.7535 on IJCAI'25 DDL-AV benchmark for cross-modal deepfake detection and localization in challenging environments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses cross-modal generalization and temporal boundary regression, providing a novel solution for generalized deepfake detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models has enabled the creation of highly realistic deepfake content, posing significant threats to digital trust across audio-visual domains. While unimodal detection methods have shown progress in identifying synthetic media, their inability to leverage cross-modal correlations and precisely localize forged segments limits their practicality against sophisticated, fine-grained manipulations. To address this, we introduce a multi-modal deepfake detection and localization framework based on a Feature Pyramid-Transformer (FPN-Transformer), addressing critical gaps in cross-modal generalization and temporal boundary regression. The proposed approach utilizes pre-trained self-supervised models (WavLM for audio, CLIP for video) to extract hierarchical temporal features. A multi-scale feature pyramid is constructed through R-TLM blocks with localized attention mechanisms, enabling joint analysis of cross-context temporal dependencies. The dual-branch prediction head simultaneously predicts forgery probabilities and refines temporal offsets of manipulated segments, achieving frame-level localization precision. We evaluate our approach on the test set of the IJCAI'25 DDL-AV benchmark, showing a good performance with a final score of 0.7535 for cross-modal deepfake detection and localization in challenging environments. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and provide a novel way for generalized deepfake detection. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/MM-DDL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The perceptual quality of 3DGS-rendered content under varying reconstruction conditions remains largely underexplored, despite factors like viewpoint sparsity, limited training iterations, point downsampling, noise, and color distortions significantly degrading visual quality.

Method: Created 3DGS-QA dataset with controlled distortion factors, then developed a no-reference quality prediction model that extracts spatial and photometric cues directly from 3D Gaussian primitives without requiring rendered images or ground-truth references.

Result: The proposed method consistently achieves superior performance compared to existing quality assessment methods, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness for 3DGS content evaluation.

Conclusion: 3DGS-QA dataset and the proposed quality prediction model provide foundational tools for systematic evaluation of 3DGS perceptual quality, addressing a critical gap in 3D visualization research.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D visualization, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading technique for real-time, high-fidelity rendering. While prior research has emphasized algorithmic performance and visual fidelity, the perceptual quality of 3DGS-rendered content, especially under varying reconstruction conditions, remains largely underexplored. In practice, factors such as viewpoint sparsity, limited training iterations, point downsampling, noise, and color distortions can significantly degrade visual quality, yet their perceptual impact has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present 3DGS-QA, the first subjective quality assessment dataset for 3DGS. It comprises 225 degraded reconstructions across 15 object types, enabling a controlled investigation of common distortion factors. Based on this dataset, we introduce a no-reference quality prediction model that directly operates on native 3D Gaussian primitives, without requiring rendered images or ground-truth references. Our model extracts spatial and photometric cues from the Gaussian representation to estimate perceived quality in a structure-aware manner. We further benchmark existing quality assessment methods, spanning both traditional and learning-based approaches. Experimental results show that our method consistently achieves superior performance, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness for 3DGS content evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation is challenging due to its ill-posed nature, and while Vision Foundation Models show strong world understanding capabilities, they need effective adaptation for depth estimation tasks.

Method: Uses VFMs as multi-level feature enhancers without modifying their structure or pretrained weights, systematically injecting prior knowledge at different representation levels.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on NYU-Depth v2 and KITTI datasets, competitive with diffusion-based approaches and methods pre-trained on relative depth, with strong zero-shot transfer capability.

Conclusion: WEDepth effectively adapts VFMs for monocular depth estimation while preserving their original structure and weights, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) has widely applicable but remains highly challenging due to the inherently ill-posed nature of reconstructing 3D scenes from single 2D images. Modern Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on large-scale diverse datasets, exhibit remarkable world understanding capabilities that benefit for various vision tasks. Recent studies have demonstrated significant improvements in MDE through fine-tuning these VFMs. Inspired by these developments, we propose WEDepth, a novel approach that adapts VFMs for MDE without modi-fying their structures and pretrained weights, while effec-tively eliciting and leveraging their inherent priors. Our method employs the VFM as a multi-level feature en-hancer, systematically injecting prior knowledge at differ-ent representation levels. Experiments on NYU-Depth v2 and KITTI datasets show that WEDepth establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, achieving competi-tive results compared to both diffusion-based approaches (which require multiple forward passes) and methods pre-trained on relative depth. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method exhibits strong zero-shot transfer capability across diverse scenarios.

Result: Reduces Generalized Energy Distance by 17% and improves mean Dice by more than one point compared with DPersona on LIDC-IDRI lung nodule and multi-institutional prostate MRI datasets.

Conclusion: Natural-language prompts can provide flexible, accurate, and interpretable control over personalized medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Automated medical image segmentation suffers from high inter-observer variability, particularly in tasks such as lung nodule delineation, where experts often disagree. Existing approaches either collapse this variability into a consensus mask or rely on separate model branches for each annotator. We introduce ProSona, a two-stage framework that learns a continuous latent space of annotation styles, enabling controllable personalization via natural language prompts. A probabilistic U-Net backbone captures diverse expert hypotheses, while a prompt-guided projection mechanism navigates this latent space to generate personalized segmentations. A multi-level contrastive objective aligns textual and visual representations, promoting disentangled and interpretable expert styles. Across the LIDC-IDRI lung nodule and multi-institutional prostate MRI datasets, ProSona reduces the Generalized Energy Distance by 17% and improves mean Dice by more than one point compared with DPersona. These results demonstrate that natural-language prompts can provide flexible, accurate, and interpretable control over personalized medical image segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GECO2 is an end-to-end few-shot counting and detection method that addresses object scale issues through a novel dense query representation that aggregates exemplar-specific features across scales, enabling detection of both large and small objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot counters struggle with images containing diverse-sized objects and densely populated regions of small objects due to ad-hoc solutions like feature merging and image upsampling with tiling.

Method: Proposes a new dense query representation that gradually aggregates exemplar-specific feature information across scales, creating high-resolution dense queries for detecting objects of various sizes.

Result: GECO2 surpasses state-of-the-art few-shot counters by 10% in both counting and detection accuracy while running 3x faster with smaller GPU memory footprint.

Conclusion: The proposed dense query representation effectively addresses object scale issues in few-shot counting and detection, achieving superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Few-shot detection-based counters estimate the number of instances in the image specified only by a few test-time exemplars. A common approach to localize objects across multiple sizes is to merge backbone features of different resolutions. Furthermore, to enable small object detection in densely populated regions, the input image is commonly upsampled and tiling is applied to cope with the increased computational and memory requirements. Because of these ad-hoc solutions, existing counters struggle with images containing diverse-sized objects and densely populated regions of small objects. We propose GECO2, an end-to-end few-shot counting and detection method that explicitly addresses the object scale issues. A new dense query representation gradually aggregates exemplar-specific feature information across scales that leads to high-resolution dense queries that enable detection of large as well as small objects. GECO2 surpasses state-of-the-art few-shot counters in counting as well as detection accuracy by 10% while running 3x times faster at smaller GPU memory footprint.

Method: LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model with latent concatenation strategy (jointly processing reference and target images) and masked Conditional Flow Matching objective, plus a two-stage Distilled Data Curation Framework for large-scale training.

Result: Enables robust identity preservation without architectural modifications and scales generation capability across various subjects and contexts through parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed approach achieves effective subject-driven image generation with improved identity consistency and diversity, validated by the CHARIS evaluation framework for comprehensive quality assessment.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation aims to synthesize novel depictions of a specific subject across diverse contexts while preserving its core identity features. Achieving both strong identity consistency and high prompt diversity presents a fundamental trade-off. We propose a LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model employing a latent concatenation strategy, which jointly processes reference and target images, combined with a masked Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) objective. This approach enables robust identity preservation without architectural modifications. To facilitate large-scale training, we introduce a two-stage Distilled Data Curation Framework: the first stage leverages data restoration and VLM-based filtering to create a compact, high-quality seed dataset from diverse sources; the second stage utilizes these curated examples for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thus scaling the generation capability across various subjects and contexts. Finally, for filtering and quality assessment, we present CHARIS, a fine-grained evaluation framework that performs attribute-level comparisons along five key axes: identity consistency, prompt adherence, region-wise color fidelity, visual quality, and transformation diversity.

Conclusion: I2E bridges the data gap in neuromorphic engineering, providing a foundational toolkit for developing high-performance SNN systems with open-source implementation.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise highly energy-efficient computing, but their adoption is hindered by a critical scarcity of event-stream data. This work introduces I2E, an algorithmic framework that resolves this bottleneck by converting static images into high-fidelity event streams. By simulating microsaccadic eye movements with a highly parallelized convolution, I2E achieves a conversion speed over 300x faster than prior methods, uniquely enabling on-the-fly data augmentation for SNN training. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated on large-scale benchmarks. An SNN trained on the generated I2E-ImageNet dataset achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.50%. Critically, this work establishes a powerful sim-to-real paradigm where pre-training on synthetic I2E data and fine-tuning on the real-world CIFAR10-DVS dataset yields an unprecedented accuracy of 92.5%. This result validates that synthetic event data can serve as a high-fidelity proxy for real sensor data, bridging a long-standing gap in neuromorphic engineering. By providing a scalable solution to the data problem, I2E offers a foundational toolkit for developing high-performance neuromorphic systems. The open-source algorithm and all generated datasets are provided to accelerate research in the field.

*Cameron Braunstein,Mariya Toneva,Eddy Ilg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion use CLIP's text encoding for semantic understanding, not the diffusion process itself, which acts as a visual decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether latent diffusion models have meaningful semantic understanding of generated images and determine where this understanding originates.

Method: Probing Stable Diffusion with regression layers to predict semantic attributes from internal representations, comparing predictions against human annotations.

Result: Semantic understanding comes from CLIP text encoding, not diffusion process; attributes vary in decoding accuracy; attributes become harder to disambiguate during diffusion.

Conclusion: CLIP vision-language model provides human-like semantic representation, while diffusion process serves as visual decoder.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion achieve state-of-the-art results on text-to-image generation tasks. However, the extent to which these models have a semantic understanding of the images they generate is not well understood. In this work, we investigate whether the internal representations used by these models during text-to-image generation contain semantic information that is meaningful to humans. To do so, we perform probing on Stable Diffusion with simple regression layers that predict semantic attributes for objects and evaluate these predictions against human annotations. Surprisingly, we find that this success can actually be attributed to the text encoding occurring in CLIP rather than the reverse diffusion process. We demonstrate that groups of specific semantic attributes have markedly different decoding accuracy than the average, and are thus represented to different degrees. Finally, we show that attributes become more difficult to disambiguate from one another during the inverse diffusion process, further demonstrating the strongest semantic representation of object attributes in CLIP. We conclude that the separately trained CLIP vision-language model is what determines the human-like semantic representation, and that the diffusion process instead takes the role of a visual decoder.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical evaluation framework called Beyond the Pixels that decomposes identity assessment into feature-level transformations using structured VLM reasoning to improve identity preservation evaluation in generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for evaluating identity preservation in generative models fail to capture fine-grained identity changes and provide limited diagnostic insight, relying on global embeddings or coarse VLM prompting.

Method: Hierarchically decomposes subjects into (type, style) -> attribute -> feature decision tree, and prompts VLMs for concrete transformations rather than abstract similarity scores to ground analysis in verifiable visual evidence.

Result: Demonstrated strong alignment with human judgments in measuring identity consistency across four state-of-the-art generative models, and introduced a new benchmark with 1,078 image-prompt pairs spanning diverse subject types.

Conclusion: The framework reduces hallucinations and improves consistency in identity preservation evaluation, providing better diagnostic capabilities for generative models.

Abstract: Evaluating identity preservation in generative models remains a critical yet unresolved challenge. Existing metrics rely on global embeddings or coarse VLM prompting, failing to capture fine-grained identity changes and providing limited diagnostic insight. We introduce Beyond the Pixels, a hierarchical evaluation framework that decomposes identity assessment into feature-level transformations. Our approach guides VLMs through structured reasoning by (1) hierarchically decomposing subjects into (type, style) -> attribute -> feature decision tree, and (2) prompting for concrete transformations rather than abstract similarity scores. This decomposition grounds VLM analysis in verifiable visual evidence, reducing hallucinations and improving consistency. We validate our framework across four state-of-the-art generative models, demonstrating strong alignment with human judgments in measuring identity consistency. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark specifically designed to stress-test generative models. It comprises 1,078 image-prompt pairs spanning diverse subject types, including underrepresented categories such as anthropomorphic and animated characters, and captures an average of six to seven transformation axes per prompt.

*Wassim Kabbani,Kiran Raja,Raghavendra Ramachandra,Christoph Busch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableMorph is a diffusion-based method that generates highly realistic, artifact-free morphed face images to improve morphing attack detection evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing morph generation methods produce blurry, artifact-ridden images that are easy to detect and don't represent real-world attack challenges, limiting effective MAD system development.

Method: Uses modern diffusion-based image synthesis to generate full-head morphed face images with sharp details, avoiding visual flaws while offering unmatched control over visual attributes.

Result: StableMorph images rival or exceed genuine face image quality and maintain strong ability to fool face recognition systems, posing greater challenges to existing MAD solutions.

Conclusion: StableMorph sets a new standard for morph quality, improves biometric security evaluation by creating more realistic attacks, and supports development of more robust detection systems.

Abstract: Face morphing attacks threaten the integrity of biometric identity systems by enabling multiple individuals to share a single identity. To develop and evaluate effective morphing attack detection (MAD) systems, we need access to high-quality, realistic morphed images that reflect the challenges posed in real-world scenarios. However, existing morph generation methods often produce images that are blurry, riddled with artifacts, or poorly constructed making them easy to detect and not representative of the most dangerous attacks. In this work, we introduce StableMorph, a novel approach that generates highly realistic, artifact-free morphed face images using modern diffusion-based image synthesis. Unlike prior methods, StableMorph produces full-head images with sharp details, avoids common visual flaws, and offers unmatched control over visual attributes. Through extensive evaluation, we show that StableMorph images not only rival or exceed the quality of genuine face images but also maintain a strong ability to fool face recognition systems posing a greater challenge to existing MAD solutions and setting a new standard for morph quality in research and operational testing. StableMorph improves the evaluation of biometric security by creating more realistic and effective attacks and supports the development of more robust detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks, and NFMs represent a novel, realistic threat due to their elastic structure and photorealistic appearance that can closely mimic victims' facial features.

Method: Created a new dataset using iPhone 11 Pro capturing 3,760 genuine samples from 100 subjects and 51,281 NFM attack samples across four presentation scenarios (humans and mannequins), then benchmarked with five state-of-the-art PAD methods.

Result: Significant performance variability across PAD methods when tested against NFM attacks, demonstrating the challenges posed by this novel spoofing technique.

Conclusion: NFMs present a serious threat to face recognition security, highlighting the need for PAD techniques that can generalize effectively to emerging spoofing threats beyond traditional attacks.

Abstract: Face recognition systems are increasingly deployed across a wide range of applications, including smartphone authentication, access control, and border security. However, these systems remain vulnerable to presentation attacks (PAs), which can significantly compromise their reliability. In this work, we introduce a new dataset focused on a novel and realistic presentation attack instrument called Nylon Face Masks (NFMs), designed to simulate advanced 3D spoofing scenarios. NFMs are particularly concerning due to their elastic structure and photorealistic appearance, which enable them to closely mimic the victim's facial geometry when worn by an attacker. To reflect real-world smartphone-based usage conditions, we collected the dataset using an iPhone 11 Pro, capturing 3,760 bona fide samples from 100 subjects and 51,281 NFM attack samples across four distinct presentation scenarios involving both humans and mannequins. We benchmark the dataset using five state-of-the-art PAD methods to evaluate their robustness under unseen attack conditions. The results demonstrate significant performance variability across methods, highlighting the challenges posed by NFMs and underscoring the importance of developing PAD techniques that generalise effectively to emerging spoofing threats.

Abstract: Latent fingerprint identification remains a challenging task due to low image quality, background noise, and partial impressions. In this work, we propose a novel identification approach called LatentPrintFormer. The proposed model integrates a CNN backbone (EfficientNet-B0) and a Transformer backbone (Swin Tiny) to extract both local and global features from latent fingerprints. A spatial attention module is employed to emphasize high-quality ridge regions while suppressing background noise. The extracted features are fused and projected into a unified 512-dimensional embedding, and matching is performed using cosine similarity in a closed-set identification setting.

*Mehmet Batuhan Duman,Alejandro Carnero,Cristian Martín,Daniel Garrido,Manuel Díaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a federated learning framework with SAM2 for foam segmentation in wastewater treatment plants, enabling privacy-preserving collaborative training across multiple plants without sharing sensitive data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foam formation in WTPs reduces treatment efficiency and increases costs, but standard ML models require large labeled datasets which are scarce due to privacy concerns and data heterogeneity across different plants.

Method: Combines Federated Learning with Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), using Flower framework for distributed training where edge nodes fine-tune SAM2 locally and a central Fog server aggregates model weights without accessing private data.

Result: The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's pre-trained weights, validated using real-world WTP images, synthetic foam data, and public datasets.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for automatic foam tracking, demonstrating the potential of integrating large foundational models into FL systems for industrial challenges with distributed sensitive data.

Abstract: Foam formation in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTPs) is a major challenge that can reduce treatment efficiency and increase costs. The ability to automatically examine changes in real-time with respect to the percentage of foam can be of great benefit to the plant. However, large amounts of labeled data are required to train standard Machine Learning (ML) models. The development of these systems is slow due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of labeled data. Additionally, the development is often hindered by the fact that different WTPs do not share their data due to privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new framework to address these challenges by combining Federated Learning (FL) with the state-of-the-art base model for image segmentation, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The FL paradigm enables collaborative model training across multiple WTPs without centralizing sensitive operational data, thereby ensuring privacy. The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's strong pre-trained weights for initialization. The methodology involves fine-tuning SAM2 on distributed clients (edge nodes) using the Flower framework, where a central Fog server orchestrates the process by aggregating model weights without accessing private data. The model was trained and validated using various data collections, including real-world images captured at a WTPs in Granada, Spain, a synthetically generated foam dataset, and images from publicly available datasets to improve generalization. This research offers a practical, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for automatic foam tracking in WTPs. The findings highlight the significant potential of integrating large-scale foundational models into FL systems to solve real-world industrial challenges characterized by distributed and sensitive data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing STR frameworks suffer from decoupled visual-linguistic optimization that amplifies error propagation through cross-modal misalignment, with visual encoders biased toward background distractors and decoders misaligned on geometrically deformed text.

Method: Three-stage architecture: (1) Dual Attention Macaron Encoder (DAME) for refined visual features, (2) Position-Aware Module (PAM) and Semantic Quantizer (SQ) for spatial-semantic integration, (3) Multi-Modal Collaborative Verifier (MMCV) for cross-modal self-correction.

Result: Achieves 83.5% average accuracy on Union14M-L benchmark and 79.1% on OST dataset, establishing new records in 9 out of 14 evaluation scenarios.

Conclusion: OTSNet's neurocognitive-inspired unified modeling approach effectively addresses cross-modal misalignment in STR, demonstrating superior performance on challenging text recognition tasks.

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains challenging due to real-world complexities, where decoupled visual-linguistic optimization in existing frameworks amplifies error propagation through cross-modal misalignment. Visual encoders exhibit attention bias toward background distractors, while decoders suffer from spatial misalignment when parsing geometrically deformed text-collectively degrading recognition accuracy for irregular patterns. Inspired by the hierarchical cognitive processes in human visual perception, we propose OTSNet, a novel three-stage network embodying a neurocognitive-inspired Observation-Thinking-Spelling pipeline for unified STR modeling. The architecture comprises three core components: (1) a Dual Attention Macaron Encoder (DAME) that refines visual features through differential attention maps to suppress irrelevant regions and enhance discriminative focus; (2) a Position-Aware Module (PAM) and Semantic Quantizer (SQ) that jointly integrate spatial context with glyph-level semantic abstraction via adaptive sampling; and (3) a Multi-Modal Collaborative Verifier (MMCV) that enforces self-correction through cross-modal fusion of visual, semantic, and character-level features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OTSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 83.5% average accuracy on the challenging Union14M-L benchmark and 79.1% on the heavily occluded OST dataset-establishing new records across 9 out of 14 evaluation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Event-RGB datasets have sparse coverage of extreme conditions and low spatial resolution (<=640x480), preventing comprehensive evaluation of detectors under challenging scenarios.

Method: Created PEOD dataset with pixel-aligned Event-RGB data, benchmarked 14 methods across three input configurations: Event-based, RGB-based, and Event-RGB fusion.

Result: Fusion models achieved excellent performance on full test set and normal subset, but in illumination challenge subset, top event-based model outperformed all fusion models, while fusion models still beat RGB-based counterparts.

Conclusion: PEOD establishes realistic benchmark for multimodal perception, revealing limitations of existing fusion methods when frame modality is severely degraded, and facilitates future research.

Abstract: Robust object detection for challenging scenarios increasingly relies on event cameras, yet existing Event-RGB datasets remain constrained by sparse coverage of extreme conditions and low spatial resolution (<= 640 x 480), which prevents comprehensive evaluation of detectors under challenging scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose PEOD, the first large-scale, pixel-aligned and high-resolution (1280 x 720) Event-RGB dataset for object detection under challenge conditions. PEOD contains 130+ spatiotemporal-aligned sequences and 340k manual bounding boxes, with 57% of data captured under low-light, overexposure, and high-speed motion. Furthermore, we benchmark 14 methods across three input configurations (Event-based, RGB-based, and Event-RGB fusion) on PEOD. On the full test set and normal subset, fusion-based models achieve the excellent performance. However, in illumination challenge subset, the top event-based model outperforms all fusion models, while fusion models still outperform their RGB-based counterparts, indicating limits of existing fusion methods when the frame modality is severely degraded. PEOD establishes a realistic, high-quality benchmark for multimodal perception and facilitates future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal learning faces expensive manual annotation costs, and unsupervised domain adaptation remains under-explored in multimodal settings, especially with heterogeneous domain shifts across different modalities.

Method: Uses information bottleneck for modality-specific representations, correlation alignment for domain matching, and formulates multi-objective optimization for balanced modality alignment, simplified to quadratic programming with closed-form solution.

Result: Extensive empirical results show Boomda outperforms competing schemes, demonstrating effective multimodal domain adaptation.

Conclusion: Boomda provides an efficient modality-balanced multimodal domain adaptation algorithm that successfully addresses heterogeneous domain shifts across modalities.

Abstract: Multimodal learning, while contributing to numerous success stories across various fields, faces the challenge of prohibitively expensive manual annotation. To address the scarcity of annotated data, a popular solution is unsupervised domain adaptation, which has been extensively studied in unimodal settings yet remains less explored in multimodal settings. In this paper, we investigate heterogeneous multimodal domain adaptation, where the primary challenge is the varying domain shifts of different modalities from the source to the target domain. We first introduce the information bottleneck method to learn representations for each modality independently, and then match the source and target domains in the representation space with correlation alignment. To balance the domain alignment of all modalities, we formulate the problem as a multi-objective task, aiming for a Pareto optimal solution. By exploiting the properties specific to our model, the problem can be simplified to a quadratic programming problem. Further approximation yields a closed-form solution, leading to an efficient modality-balanced multimodal domain adaptation algorithm. The proposed method features \textbf{B}alanced multi-\textbf{o}bjective \textbf{o}ptimization for \textbf{m}ultimodal \textbf{d}omain \textbf{a}daptation, termed \textbf{Boomda}. Extensive empirical results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach and demonstrate that Boomda outperforms the competing schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FR-IQA methods fail with misaligned references in NVS, while NR-IQA methods lack generalization. There's a need for quality assessment that handles partial scene content without pixel-level alignment.

Method: Built a large-scale dataset with synthetic distortions targeting Temporal Regions of Interest. Used contrastive learning framework with LoRA-enhanced DINOv2 embeddings, supervised by existing IQA methods. Trained exclusively on synthetic distortions to avoid overfitting.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art FR-IQA, NR-IQA, and NAR-IQA methods on both aligned and non-aligned references. Strong correlation with human preferences from user study on non-aligned references in NVS.

Conclusion: The proposed NAR-IQA framework effectively addresses the challenge of quality assessment in NVS with non-aligned references, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capability.

Abstract: Evaluating the perceptual quality of Novel View Synthesis (NVS) images remains a key challenge, particularly in the absence of pixel-aligned ground truth references. Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment (FR-IQA) methods fail under misalignment, while No-Reference (NR-IQA) methods struggle with generalization. In this work, we introduce a Non-Aligned Reference (NAR-IQA) framework tailored for NVS, where it is assumed that the reference view shares partial scene content but lacks pixel-level alignment. We constructed a large-scale image dataset containing synthetic distortions targeting Temporal Regions of Interest (TROI) to train our NAR-IQA model. Our model is built on a contrastive learning framework that incorporates LoRA-enhanced DINOv2 embeddings and is guided by supervision from existing IQA methods. We train exclusively on synthetically generated distortions, deliberately avoiding overfitting to specific real NVS samples and thereby enhancing the model's generalization capability. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art FR-IQA, NR-IQA, and NAR-IQA methods, achieving robust performance on both aligned and non-aligned references. We also conducted a novel user study to gather data on human preferences when viewing non-aligned references in NVS. We find strong correlation between our proposed quality prediction model and the collected subjective ratings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LandSegmenter is a Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) foundation model framework that addresses data scarcity through weak supervision, cross-modal feature extraction, and confidence-guided fusion for improved zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LULC models are limited by modality specificity and fixed taxonomies, while foundation models require extensive labeled data that is costly in remote sensing. There's a need for universal LULC models that can work across modalities with minimal labeled data.

Method: Proposed LandSegmenter framework with three key components: (1) LAS dataset using weak labels from existing LULC products, (2) RS-specific adapter for cross-modal feature extraction and text encoder for semantic awareness, (3) class-wise confidence-guided fusion strategy.

Result: Evaluated on six LULC datasets across diverse modalities and taxonomies. Achieved competitive or superior performance, especially in zero-shot settings when transferred to unseen datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of weak supervision.

Conclusion: LandSegmenter provides an effective framework for building task-specific foundation models in remote sensing using weak supervision, enabling scalable LULC mapping across diverse domains with minimal labeled data requirements.

Abstract: Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) mapping is a fundamental task in Earth Observation (EO). However, current LULC models are typically developed for a specific modality and a fixed class taxonomy, limiting their generability and broader applicability. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) offer promising opportunities for building universal models. Yet, task-agnostic FMs often require fine-tuning for downstream applications, whereas task-specific FMs rely on massive amounts of labeled data for training, which is costly and impractical in the remote sensing (RS) domain. To address these challenges, we propose LandSegmenter, an LULC FM framework that resolves three-stage challenges at the input, model, and output levels. From the input side, to alleviate the heavy demand on labeled data for FM training, we introduce LAnd Segment (LAS), a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-source dataset built primarily with globally sampled weak labels from existing LULC products. LAS provides a scalable, cost-effective alternative to manual annotation, enabling large-scale FM training across diverse LULC domains. For model architecture, LandSegmenter integrates an RS-specific adapter for cross-modal feature extraction and a text encoder for semantic awareness enhancement. At the output stage, we introduce a class-wise confidence-guided fusion strategy to mitigate semantic omissions and further improve LandSegmenter's zero-shot performance. We evaluate LandSegmenter on six precisely annotated LULC datasets spanning diverse modalities and class taxonomies. Extensive transfer learning and zero-shot experiments demonstrate that LandSegmenter achieves competitive or superior performance, particularly in zero-shot settings when transferred to unseen datasets. These results highlight the efficacy of our proposed framework and the utility of weak supervision for building task-specific FMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ZSL methods overlook intrinsic interactions between local region features, which could improve transferable and explicit visual feature acquisition for better unseen class recognition.

Method: Uses multi-granularity feature extraction module for decoupled region feature mining, and cross-granularity feature fusion module to strengthen interactions between region features of varying granularities.

Result: Extensive experiments on three popular ZSL benchmark datasets demonstrate superiority and competitiveness of the proposed Mg-MRN method.

Conclusion: The Mg-MRN network effectively refines discriminative and transferable visual features through multi-granularity learning and cross-granularity interactions, improving ZSL performance.

Abstract: Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes with zero samples by transferring semantic knowledge from seen classes. Current approaches typically correlate global visual features with semantic information (i.e., attributes) or align local visual region features with corresponding attributes to enhance visual-semantic interactions. Although effective, these methods often overlook the intrinsic interactions between local region features, which can further improve the acquisition of transferable and explicit visual features. In this paper, we propose a network named Multi-Granularity Mutual Refinement Network (Mg-MRN), which refine discriminative and transferable visual features by learning decoupled multi-granularity features and cross-granularity feature interactions. Specifically, we design a multi-granularity feature extraction module to learn region-level discriminative features through decoupled region feature mining. Then, a cross-granularity feature fusion module strengthens the inherent interactions between region features of varying granularities. This module enhances the discriminability of representations at each granularity level by integrating region representations from adjacent hierarchies, further improving ZSL recognition performance. Extensive experiments on three popular ZSL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and competitiveness of our proposed Mg-MRN method.

TL;DR: Proposes a shadow generation framework using Keypoints Linear Model and Shadow Triangle Algorithm to create realistic shadows in image composition, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods like IC-Light fail to produce shadows with both high appearance realism and geometric precision, especially for articulated human bodies in composite images.

Method: Uses Keypoints Linear Model (KPLM) with 9 keypoints and 1 bounding block for physically plausible shadow projection, and Shadow Triangle Algorithm (STA) for geometric accuracy through explicit formulations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on shadow realism benchmarks, particularly for complex human poses, and generalizes well to multi-directional relighting scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations in shadow generation by combining physical modeling with geometric precision, enabling realistic shadow creation in image composition.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly integrate a foreground object into a background, where generating realistic and geometrically accurate shadows remains a persistent challenge. While recent diffusion-based methods have outperformed GAN-based approaches, existing techniques, such as the diffusion-based relighting framework IC-Light, still fall short in producing shadows with both high appearance realism and geometric precision, especially in composite images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel shadow generation framework based on a Keypoints Linear Model (KPLM) and a Shadow Triangle Algorithm (STA). KPLM models articulated human bodies using nine keypoints and one bounding block, enabling physically plausible shadow projection and dynamic shading across joints, thereby enhancing visual realism. STA further improves geometric accuracy by computing shadow angles, lengths, and spatial positions through explicit geometric formulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on shadow realism benchmarks, particularly under complex human poses, and generalizes effectively to multi-directional relighting scenarios such as those supported by IC-Light.

TL;DR: Proposes DistZSL framework for distributed zero-shot learning that handles data heterogeneity across nodes using cross-node attribute regularization and global attribute-to-visual consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To effectively learn zero-shot learning models from decentralized data while addressing data heterogeneity issues across distributed nodes.

Method: Uses cross-node attribute regularizer to stabilize attribute feature space and global attribute-to-visual consensus to mitigate biased visual-to-attribute mappings across nodes.

Result: Achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in learning from distributed data.

Conclusion: DistZSL framework effectively handles distributed zero-shot learning by addressing data heterogeneity through attribute regularization and consensus mechanisms.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Distributed Zero-Shot Learning (DistZSL) framework that can fully exploit decentralized data to learn an effective model for unseen classes. Considering the data heterogeneity issues across distributed nodes, we introduce two key components to ensure the effective learning of DistZSL: a cross-node attribute regularizer and a global attribute-to-visual consensus. Our proposed cross-node attribute regularizer enforces the distances between attribute features to be similar across different nodes. In this manner, the overall attribute feature space would be stable during learning, and thus facilitate the establishment of visual-to-attribute(V2A) relationships. Then, we introduce the global attribute-tovisual consensus to mitigate biased V2A mappings learned from individual nodes. Specifically, we enforce the bilateral mapping between the attribute and visual feature distributions to be consistent across different nodes. Thus, the learned consistent V2A mapping can significantly enhance zero-shot learning across different nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DistZSL achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art in learning from distributed data.

*Samet Hicsonmez,Abd El Rahman Shabayek,Djamila Aouada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMDiff is an unsupervised multi-class visual anomaly detection framework that combines Latent Diffusion Models with Vision-Language Models to improve anomaly localization and detection without per-class training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based methods for visual anomaly detection rely on synthetic noise generation and require per-class model training, limiting generalization and scalability for multi-class real-world images.

Method: Integrates pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), where VLM extracts detailed image descriptions as additional conditioning for LDM training, enabling robust normal feature representation learning without manual annotations.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with significant improvements: 25 points increase in pixel-level PRO metric on Real-IAD dataset and 8 points on COCO-AD dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed VLMDiff framework effectively leverages vision-language models to enhance multi-class visual anomaly detection, demonstrating superior performance and scalability compared to existing diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Detecting visual anomalies in diverse, multi-class real-world images is a significant challenge. We introduce \ours, a novel unsupervised multi-class visual anomaly detection framework. It integrates a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for enhanced anomaly localization and detection. Specifically, a pre-trained VLM with a simple prompt extracts detailed image descriptions, serving as additional conditioning for LDM training. Current diffusion-based methods rely on synthetic noise generation, limiting their generalization and requiring per-class model training, which hinders scalability. \ours, however, leverages VLMs to obtain normal captions without manual annotations or additional training. These descriptions condition the diffusion model, learning a robust normal image feature representation for multi-class anomaly detection. Our method achieves competitive performance, improving the pixel-level Per-Region-Overlap (PRO) metric by up to 25 points on the Real-IAD dataset and 8 points on the COCO-AD dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches.

*Kaitao Huang,Yan Yan,Jing-Hao Xue,Hanzi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WarpGAN introduces a warping-and-inpainting strategy for 3D GAN inversion to improve novel view synthesis by better handling occluded regions using symmetry priors and multi-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D GAN inversion methods focus on visible regions but generate poor quality occluded regions due to information loss from low bit-rate latent codes.

Method: Uses 3D GAN inversion encoder to get latent code, warps to novel view using depth maps, and employs SVINet with symmetry priors and multi-view correspondence for inpainting occluded regions.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments show WarpGAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The warping-and-inpainting strategy effectively improves occluded region generation in 3D GAN inversion for single-shot novel view synthesis.

Abstract: 3D GAN inversion projects a single image into the latent space of a pre-trained 3D GAN to achieve single-shot novel view synthesis, which requires visible regions with high fidelity and occluded regions with realism and multi-view consistency. However, existing methods focus on the reconstruction of visible regions, while the generation of occluded regions relies only on the generative prior of 3D GAN. As a result, the generated occluded regions often exhibit poor quality due to the information loss caused by the low bit-rate latent code. To address this, we introduce the warping-and-inpainting strategy to incorporate image inpainting into 3D GAN inversion and propose a novel 3D GAN inversion method, WarpGAN. Specifically, we first employ a 3D GAN inversion encoder to project the single-view image into a latent code that serves as the input to 3D GAN. Then, we perform warping to a novel view using the depth map generated by 3D GAN. Finally, we develop a novel SVINet, which leverages the symmetry prior and multi-view image correspondence w.r.t. the same latent code to perform inpainting of occluded regions in the warped image. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

*Yunhui Zhu,Buliao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PQA replaces box-level IoU prediction with pixel-level spatial consistency to eliminate structural coupling bias in oriented object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Box-level IoU prediction suffers from structural coupling where predicted IoU can be overestimated for poorly localized boxes due to inherent similarity between predicted and estimated GT boxes.

Method: Proposes Pixel-level Quality Assessment (PQA) framework that measures alignment between pixel positions relative to predicted and GT boxes, integrating pixel-level spatial consistency into unified quality score.

Result: Extensive experiments on HRSC2016 and DOTA show consistent performance improvements (+5.96% AP50:95 on Rotated RetinaNet, +2.32% on STD).

Conclusion: PQA effectively eliminates similarity bias in box-level IoU prediction and can be seamlessly integrated into various oriented object detectors for improved performance.

Abstract: Modern oriented object detectors typically predict a set of bounding boxes and select the top-ranked ones based on estimated localization quality. Achieving high detection performance requires that the estimated quality closely aligns with the actual localization accuracy. To this end, existing approaches predict the Intersection over Union (IoU) between the predicted and ground-truth (GT) boxes as a proxy for localization quality. However, box-level IoU prediction suffers from a structural coupling issue: since the predicted box is derived from the detector's internal estimation of the GT box, the predicted IoU--based on their similarity--can be overestimated for poorly localized boxes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Pixel-level Quality Assessment (PQA) framework, which replaces box-level IoU prediction with the integration of pixel-level spatial consistency. PQA measures the alignment between each pixel's relative position to the predicted box and its corresponding position to the GT box. By operating at the pixel level, PQA avoids directly comparing the predicted box with the estimated GT box, thereby eliminating the inherent similarity bias in box-level IoU prediction. Furthermore, we introduce a new integration metric that aggregates pixel-level spatial consistency into a unified quality score, yielding a more accurate approximation of the actual localization quality. Extensive experiments on HRSC2016 and DOTA demonstrate that PQA can be seamlessly integrated into various oriented object detectors, consistently improving performance (e.g., +5.96% AP$_{50:95}$ on Rotated RetinaNet and +2.32% on STD).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UI coding approaches face limitations in multimodal capabilities and single-turn paradigms that don't utilize iterative visual feedback, making UI programming complex and inefficient.

Method: Interactive UI-to-code paradigm with UI2Code$^\text{N}$ model trained through staged pretraining, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. Unifies UI-to-code generation, UI editing, and UI polishing capabilities with test-time scaling for multi-turn feedback.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art among open-source models and achieves performance comparable to Claude-4-Sonnet and GPT-5 on UI-to-code and UI polishing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The interactive paradigm with UI2Code$^\text{N}$ significantly improves UI coding by leveraging multimodal capabilities and iterative visual feedback, advancing automated UI development.

Abstract: User interface (UI) programming is a core yet highly complex part of modern software development. Recent advances in visual language models (VLMs) highlight the potential of automatic UI coding, but current approaches face two key limitations: multimodal coding capabilities remain underdeveloped, and single-turn paradigms make little use of iterative visual feedback. We address these challenges with an interactive UI-to-code paradigm that better reflects real-world workflows and raises the upper bound of achievable performance. Under this paradigm, we present UI2Code$^\text{N}$, a visual language model trained through staged pretraining, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning to achieve foundational improvements in multimodal coding. The model unifies three key capabilities: UI-to-code generation, UI editing, and UI polishing. We further explore test-time scaling for interactive generation, enabling systematic use of multi-turn feedback. Experiments on UI-to-code and UI polishing benchmarks show that UI2Code$^\text{N}$ establishes a new state of the art among open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models such as Claude-4-Sonnet and GPT-5.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in medical AI outside controlled settings, including limited data due to ethical/legal restrictions, high annotation costs, and the need to handle emerging/rare diseases through open-set recognition.

Method: Introduces a loss function that penalizes open space regions using auxiliary datasets, leveraging the observation that features in deep neural networks cluster around class means arranged as vertices of a regular simplex.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains across four MedMNIST datasets (BloodMNIST, OCTMNIST, DermaMNIST, TissueMNIST) and a public skin dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses open-set recognition challenges in medical imaging by leveraging auxiliary datasets and geometric properties of feature representations, demonstrating superior performance on multiple medical benchmarks.

Abstract: Driven by advancements in deep learning, computer-aided diagnoses have made remarkable progress. However, outside controlled laboratory settings, algorithms may encounter several challenges. In the medical domain, these difficulties often stem from limited data availability due to ethical and legal restrictions, as well as the high cost and time required for expert annotations-especially in the face of emerging or rare diseases. In this context, open-set recognition plays a vital role by identifying whether a sample belongs to one of the known classes seen during training or should be rejected as an unknown. Recent studies have shown that features learned in the later stages of deep neural networks are observed to cluster around their class means, which themselves are arranged as individual vertices of a regular simplex [32]. The proposed method introduces a loss function designed to reject samples of unknown classes effectively by penalizing open space regions using auxiliary datasets. This approach achieves significant performance gain across four MedMNIST datasets-BloodMNIST, OCTMNIST, DermaMNIST, TissueMNIST and a publicly available skin dataset [29] outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: Large-scale image-to-3D generative models have strong canonical view bias, struggling with rotated inputs. A lightweight CNN can detect and correct orientation to restore performance without modifying the main model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and address the opacity in inductive biases of large-scale image-to-3D generative models, specifically the canonical view bias that limits generalization across viewpoints.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments using simple 2D rotations on Hunyuan3D 2.0 model. Proposed a lightweight CNN to detect and correct input orientation without modifying the generative backbone.

Result: State-of-the-art models show degraded performance under rotated inputs. The lightweight CNN successfully mitigates this failure by correcting orientation, restoring model performance.

Conclusion: Scale alone may not be sufficient for robust 3D generation; modular, symmetry-aware designs should be pursued to address fundamental biases in generative models.

Abstract: Despite their impressive results, large-scale image-to-3D generative models remain opaque in their inductive biases. We identify a significant limitation in image-conditioned 3D generative models: a strong canonical view bias. Through controlled experiments using simple 2D rotations, we show that the state-of-the-art Hunyuan3D 2.0 model can struggle to generalize across viewpoints, with performance degrading under rotated inputs. We show that this failure can be mitigated by a lightweight CNN that detects and corrects input orientation, restoring model performance without modifying the generative backbone. Our findings raise an important open question: Is scale enough, or should we pursue modular, symmetry-aware designs?

TL;DR: A multimodal pipeline combining EfficientNet-B4 for food recognition with Gemini LLM for nutritional analysis was evaluated, showing visual accuracy as the main bottleneck despite good generative output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for robust automated nutritional analysis and culinary guidance in digital food applications, while evaluating trade-offs between visual classification accuracy, model efficiency, and generative output quality.

Method: Developed a decoupled multimodal pipeline integrating visual backbones (EfficientNet-B4, VGG-16, ResNet-50, YOLOv8) with language models (Gemini, Gemma), introduced Semantic Error Propagation (SEP) analysis, and used a Custom Chinese Food Dataset (CCFD) to address cultural bias.

Result: EfficientNet-B4 achieved 89.0% Top-1 accuracy with best efficiency balance, Gemini scored 9.2/10 factual accuracy for superior generative quality, but system performance was bottlenecked by visual front-end accuracy, with high semantic similarity identified as the critical failure mode.

Conclusion: The overall system utility is fundamentally limited by the visual module's perceptive accuracy, despite strong generative capabilities from the language model component, highlighting the importance of improving visual recognition for reliable automated food analysis.

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food applications necessitates robust methods for automated nutritional analysis and culinary guidance. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of a decoupled, multimodal pipeline for food recognition. We evaluate a system integrating a specialized visual backbone (EfficientNet-B4) with a powerful generative large language model (Google's Gemini LLM). The core objective is to evaluate the trade-offs between visual classification accuracy, model efficiency, and the quality of generative output (nutritional data and recipes). We benchmark this pipeline against alternative vision backbones (VGG-16, ResNet-50, YOLOv8) and a lightweight LLM (Gemma). We introduce a formalization for "Semantic Error Propagation" (SEP) to analyze how classification inaccuracies from the visual module cascade into the generative output. Our analysis is grounded in a new Custom Chinese Food Dataset (CCFD) developed to address cultural bias in public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that while EfficientNet-B4 (89.0\% Top-1 Acc.) provides the best balance of accuracy and efficiency, and Gemini (9.2/10 Factual Accuracy) provides superior generative quality, the system's overall utility is fundamentally bottlenecked by the visual front-end's perceptive accuracy. We conduct a detailed per-class analysis, identifying high semantic similarity as the most critical failure mode.

Conclusion: The geometry-guided pipeline provides a surprisingly simple yet viable solution for real-world 3D super-resolution, especially when high-resolution RGB data is unavailable.

Abstract: We introduce 2Dto3D-SR, a versatile framework for real-time single-view 3D super-resolution that eliminates the need for high-resolution RGB guidance. Our framework encodes 3D data from a single viewpoint into a structured 2D representation, enabling the direct application of existing 2D image super-resolution architectures. We utilize the Projected Normalized Coordinate Code (PNCC) to represent 3D geometry from a visible surface as a regular image, thereby circumventing the complexities of 3D point-based or RGB-guided methods. This design supports lightweight and fast models adaptable to various deployment environments. We evaluate 2Dto3D-SR with two implementations: one using Swin Transformers for high accuracy, and another using Vision Mamba for high efficiency. Experiments show the Swin Transformer model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on standard benchmarks, while the Vision Mamba model delivers competitive results at real-time speeds. This establishes our geometry-guided pipeline as a surprisingly simple yet viable and practical solution for real-world scenarios, especially where high-resolution RGB data is inaccessible.

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive local region placement and sizing based on point cloud curvature to improve surface reconstruction accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods use uniform local region placement and fixed sizes, which limits adaptability to variations in geometric complexity.

Method: Adaptively modulates the spacing and size of local regions based on the curvature of the input point cloud.

Result: Improved reconstruction accuracy and efficiency compared to uniform approaches.

Conclusion: Adaptive local region modulation based on curvature enhances surface reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Point cloud surface reconstruction has improved in accuracy with advances in deep learning, enabling applications such as infrastructure inspection. Recent approaches that reconstruct from small local regions rather than entire point clouds have attracted attention for their strong generalization capability. However, prior work typically places local regions uniformly and keeps their size fixed, limiting adaptability to variations in geometric complexity. In this study, we propose a method that improves reconstruction accuracy and efficiency by adaptively modulating the spacing and size of local regions based on the curvature of the input point cloud.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language fine-tuning methods overlook semantic relationships within images when aligning vision and language, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Extract multilevel semantic features from vision encoders, project vision features to group related semantics, and fuse visual-textual features using inheritable cross-attention that discards low-correlation feature pairs.

Result: Outperforms all existing methods on eight foundation models across visual question answering and image captioning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves multimodal alignment and fusion by leveraging both semantics and relationships.

Abstract: Vision-language fine-tuning has emerged as an efficient paradigm for constructing multimodal foundation models. While textual context often highlights semantic relationships within an image, existing fine-tuning methods typically overlook this information when aligning vision and language, thus leading to suboptimal performance. Toward solving this problem, we propose a method that can improve multimodal alignment and fusion based on both semantics and relationships.Specifically, we first extract multilevel semantic features from different vision encoder to capture more visual cues of the relationships. Then, we learn to project the vision features to group related semantics, among which are more likely to have relationships. Finally, we fuse the visual features with the textual by using inheritable cross-attention, where we globally remove the redundant visual relationships by discarding visual-language feature pairs with low correlation. We evaluate our proposed method on eight foundation models and two downstream tasks, visual question answering and image captioning, and show that it outperforms all existing methods.

TL;DR: DiPVNet is a novel point cloud processing method that addresses rotational variations through direction-perceptive vector networks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on classification and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud processing faces challenges from arbitrary rotations that disrupt intrinsic directional characteristics, and existing methods fail to fully exploit multiscale directional nature of point clouds.

Method: Proposes Direction-Perceptive Vector Network (DiPVNet) with atomic dot-product operator for directional selectivity and rotation invariance. Includes Learnable Local Dot-Product (L2DP) Operator for local non-uniform structures and global directional response spectrum via direction-aware spherical Fourier transform.

Result: Extensive experiments show DiPVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on point cloud classification and segmentation tasks, particularly robust in challenging scenarios with noise and large-angle rotations.

Conclusion: DiPVNet effectively addresses rotational variations in point clouds through direction-perceptive modeling at both local and global scales, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Point cloud processing has become a cornerstone technology in many 3D vision tasks. However, arbitrary rotations introduce variations in point cloud orientations, posing a long-standing challenge for effective representation learning. The core of this issue is the disruption of the point cloud's intrinsic directional characteristics caused by rotational perturbations. Recent methods attempt to implicitly model rotational equivariance and invariance, preserving directional information and propagating it into deep semantic spaces. Yet, they often fall short of fully exploiting the multiscale directional nature of point clouds to enhance feature representations. To address this, we propose the Direction-Perceptive Vector Network (DiPVNet). At its core is an atomic dot-product operator that simultaneously encodes directional selectivity and rotation invariance--endowing the network with both rotational symmetry modeling and adaptive directional perception. At the local level, we introduce a Learnable Local Dot-Product (L2DP) Operator, which enables interactions between a center point and its neighbors to adaptively capture the non-uniform local structures of point clouds. At the global level, we leverage generalized harmonic analysis to prove that the dot-product between point clouds and spherical sampling vectors is equivalent to a direction-aware spherical Fourier transform (DASFT). This leads to the construction of a global directional response spectrum for modeling holistic directional structures. We rigorously prove the rotation invariance of both operators. Extensive experiments on challenging scenarios involving noise and large-angle rotations demonstrate that DiPVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on point cloud classification and segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free OVSS methods have limitations including expensive affinity refinement, ineffective attention fusion with equal weighting, and reliance on fixed-size Gaussian kernels that enforce isotropic neighborhoods.

Method: Integrates global and local information from stable diffusion self-attention, uses entropy-based uncertainty to select relevant attention maps, and employs stochastic random walk for affinity refinement instead of fixed kernels.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation performance on 7 popular benchmarks without requiring CRF or PAMR post-processing.

Conclusion: NERVE provides an effective training-free approach for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation that effectively delineates objects with arbitrary shapes through spatial diffusion and intelligent attention selection.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS), existing training-free methods face several limitations: use of computationally expensive affinity refinement strategies, ineffective fusion of transformer attention maps due to equal weighting or reliance on fixed-size Gaussian kernels to reinforce local spatial smoothness, enforcing isotropic neighborhoods. We propose a strong baseline for training-free OVSS termed as NERVE (Neighbourhood \& Entropy-guided Random-walk for open-Vocabulary sEgmentation), which uniquely integrates global and fine-grained local information, exploiting the neighbourhood structure from the self-attention layer of a stable diffusion model. We also introduce a stochastic random walk for refining the affinity rather than relying on fixed-size Gaussian kernels for local context. This spatial diffusion process encourages propagation across connected and semantically related areas, enabling it to effectively delineate objects with arbitrary shapes. Whereas most existing approaches treat self-attention maps from different transformer heads or layers equally, our method uses entropy-based uncertainty to select the most relevant maps. Notably, our method does not require any conventional post-processing techniques like Conditional Random Fields (CRF) or Pixel-Adaptive Mask Refinement (PAMR). Experiments are performed on 7 popular semantic segmentation benchmarks, yielding an overall state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation performance, providing an effective approach to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

Method: Proposes a "decompose-editing-fusion" framework with: (1) Conflict-aware Layer Decomposition using attention-aware IoU and time-dependent region removal; (2) Object-layered Editing with coordinated intra-layer text guidance and cross-layer geometric mapping; (3) Transparency-guided Layer Fusion with structure-coherent fusion through transparency guidance learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show LayerEdit's superiority over existing methods, demonstrating unprecedented intra-object controllability and inter-object coherence in complex multi-object scenarios.

Conclusion: LayerEdit successfully addresses inter-object attention entanglements through precise object-layered decomposition and coherent fusion, enabling effective multi-object image editing without training requirements.

Abstract: Text-driven multi-object image editing which aims to precisely modify multiple objects within an image based on text descriptions, has recently attracted considerable interest. Existing works primarily follow the localize-editing paradigm, focusing on independent object localization and editing while neglecting critical inter-object interactions. However, this work points out that the neglected attention entanglements in inter-object conflict regions, inherently hinder disentangled multi-object editing, leading to either inter-object editing leakage or intra-object editing constraints. We thereby propose a novel multi-layer disentangled editing framework LayerEdit, a training-free method which, for the first time, through precise object-layered decomposition and coherent fusion, enables conflict-free object-layered editing. Specifically, LayerEdit introduces a novel "decompose-editingfusion" framework, consisting of: (1) Conflict-aware Layer Decomposition module, which utilizes an attention-aware IoU scheme and time-dependent region removing, to enhance conflict awareness and suppression for layer decomposition. (2) Object-layered Editing module, to establish coordinated intra-layer text guidance and cross-layer geometric mapping, achieving disentangled semantic and structural modifications. (3) Transparency-guided Layer Fusion module, to facilitate structure-coherent inter-object layer fusion through precise transparency guidance learning. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of LayerEdit over existing methods, showing unprecedented intra-object controllability and inter-object coherence in complex multi-object scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data condensation techniques fail in multimodal scenarios because they cannot preserve intricate inter-modal dependencies crucial for effective model training.

Method: Uses Characteristic Function loss in Fourier domain for precise statistical alignment, enforcing three levels of distributional consistency: uni-modal, cross-modal, and joint-modal alignment within ImageBind's unified feature space.

Result: On NYU-v2 dataset, achieves lossless performance with just 5 condensed datapoints per class, 8.2% absolute improvement over previous best method, and more than 4x faster condensation time.

Conclusion: ImageBindDC effectively addresses multimodal data condensation by preserving complex inter-modal dependencies through statistical alignment in unified feature space, setting new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Data condensation techniques aim to synthesize a compact dataset from a larger one to enable efficient model training, yet while successful in unimodal settings, they often fail in multimodal scenarios where preserving intricate inter-modal dependencies is crucial. To address this, we introduce ImageBindDC, a novel data condensation framework operating within the unified feature space of ImageBind. Our approach moves beyond conventional distribution-matching by employing a powerful Characteristic Function (CF) loss, which operates in the Fourier domain to facilitate a more precise statistical alignment via exact infinite moment matching. We design our objective to enforce three critical levels of distributional consistency: (i) uni-modal alignment, which matches the statistical properties of synthetic and real data within each modality; (ii) cross-modal alignment, which preserves pairwise semantics by matching the distributions of hybrid real-synthetic data pairs; and (iii) joint-modal alignment, which captures the complete multivariate data structure by aligning the joint distribution of real data pairs with their synthetic counterparts. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of ImageBindDC: on the NYU-v2 dataset, a model trained on just 5 condensed datapoints per class achieves lossless performance comparable to one trained on the full dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art with an 8.2\% absolute improvement over the previous best method and more than 4$\times$ less condensation time.

TL;DR: ESC framework unifies event-RGB features using edge cues for robust semantic segmentation under extreme conditions, outperforming SOTA by 2.55% mIoU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic segmentation methods fail under extreme conditions (low light, camera motion) due to RGB information loss, while event-RGB fusion suffers from feature heterogeneity.

Method: Edge-awareness Semantic Concordance framework with Edge-awareness Latent Re-coding to align features using edge dictionary, and Re-coded Consolidation with Uncertainty Optimization for fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art by 2.55% mIoU on DERS-XS dataset, shows superior resilience under spatial occlusion.

Conclusion: ESC framework effectively solves heterogeneous event-RGB fusion for robust semantic segmentation in extreme conditions.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has achieved great success in ideal conditions. However, when facing extreme conditions (e.g., insufficient light, fierce camera motion), most existing methods suffer from significant information loss of RGB, severely damaging segmentation results. Several researches exploit the high-speed and high-dynamic event modality as a complement, but event and RGB are naturally heterogeneous, which leads to feature-level mismatch and inferior optimization of existing multi-modality methods. Different from these researches, we delve into the edge secret of both modalities for resilient fusion and propose a novel Edge-awareness Semantic Concordance framework to unify the multi-modality heterogeneous features with latent edge cues. In this framework, we first propose Edge-awareness Latent Re-coding, which obtains uncertainty indicators while realigning event-RGB features into unified semantic space guided by re-coded distribution, and transfers event-RGB distributions into re-coded features by utilizing a pre-established edge dictionary as clues. We then propose Re-coded Consolidation and Uncertainty Optimization, which utilize re-coded edge features and uncertainty indicators to solve the heterogeneous event-RGB fusion issues under extreme conditions. We establish two synthetic and one real-world event-RGB semantic segmentation datasets for extreme scenario comparisons. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a 2.55% mIoU on our proposed DERS-XS, and possesses superior resilience under spatial occlusion.

Result: In a pilot study with 4 pathologists annotating 600 mitotic figure patches, SWAN achieved 86.52-93.68% pairwise agreement (Cohen's Kappa 0.61-0.80), comparable to folder-based method (86.98-91.32%, Kappa 0.63-0.75).

Conclusion: SWAN accelerates image annotation while maintaining quality, offering a scalable and user-friendly alternative to conventional annotation workflows.

Abstract: The annotation of large scale histopathology image datasets remains a major bottleneck in developing robust deep learning models for clinically relevant tasks, such as mitotic figure classification. Folder-based annotation workflows are usually slow, fatiguing, and difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we introduce SWipeable ANnotations (SWAN), an open-source, MIT-licensed web application that enables intuitive image patch classification using a swiping gesture. SWAN supports both desktop and mobile platforms, offers real-time metadata capture, and allows flexible mapping of swipe gestures to class labels. In a pilot study with four pathologists annotating 600 mitotic figure image patches, we compared SWAN against a traditional folder-sorting workflow. SWAN enabled rapid annotations with pairwise percent agreement ranging from 86.52% to 93.68% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.61-0.80), while for the folder-based method, the pairwise percent agreement ranged from 86.98% to 91.32% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.63-0.75) for the task of classifying atypical versus normal mitotic figures, demonstrating high consistency between annotators and comparable performance. Participants rated the tool as highly usable and appreciated the ability to annotate on mobile devices. These results suggest that SWAN can accelerate image annotation while maintaining annotation quality, offering a scalable and user-friendly alternative to conventional workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fusion methods are either too task-specific or apply uniform strategies across diverse tasks, ignoring their distinct fusion mechanisms.

Method: Uses dual cross-image autoencoders with encoders mapping to shared latent space and decoders acting as feature injectors. Architecture adapts to fusion mechanisms (additive/multiplicative) for selective feature integration.

Result: Extensive experiments validate effectiveness and generalization ability across diverse fusion tasks.

Conclusion: MAUGIF provides a flexible framework that adapts to different fusion mechanisms, enhancing both performance and interpretability in image fusion tasks.

Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate structural and complementary information from multi-source images. However, existing fusion methods are often either highly task-specific, or general frameworks that apply uniform strategies across diverse tasks, ignoring their distinct fusion mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a mechanism-aware unsupervised general image fusion (MAUGIF) method based on dual cross-image autoencoders. Initially, we introduce a classification of additive and multiplicative fusion according to the inherent mechanisms of different fusion tasks. Then, dual encoders map source images into a shared latent space, capturing common content while isolating modality-specific details. During the decoding phase, dual decoders act as feature injectors, selectively reintegrating the unique characteristics of each modality into the shared content for reconstruction. The modality-specific features are injected into the source image in the fusion process, generating the fused image that integrates information from both modalities. The architecture of decoders varies according to their fusion mechanisms, enhancing both performance and interpretability. Extensive experiments are conducted on diverse fusion tasks to validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MAUGIF.

Conclusion: SynWeather enables unified multi-region, multi-variable weather data synthesis, and SynWeatherDiff provides a probabilistic solution that overcomes the limitations of deterministic approaches and over-smoothing issues.

Abstract: With the advancement of meteorological instruments, abundant data has become available. Current approaches are typically focus on single-variable, single-region tasks and primarily rely on deterministic modeling. This limits unified synthesis across variables and regions, overlooks cross-variable complementarity and often leads to over-smoothed results. To address above challenges, we introduce SynWeather, the first dataset designed for Unified Multi-region and Multi-variable Weather Observation Data Synthesis. SynWeather covers four representative regions: the Continental United States, Europe, East Asia, and Tropical Cyclone regions, as well as provides high-resolution observations of key weather variables, including Composite Radar Reflectivity, Hourly Precipitation, Visible Light, and Microwave Brightness Temperature. In addition, we introduce SynWeatherDiff, a general and probabilistic weather synthesis model built upon the Diffusion Transformer framework to address the over-smoothed problem. Experiments on the SynWeather dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our network compared with both task-specific and general models.

TL;DR: SkelSplat: A novel framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation using differentiable Gaussian rendering that models human pose as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians, enabling seamless fusion of arbitrary camera views without 3D ground-truth supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art multi-view methods rely on large annotated datasets and suffer from poor generalization when test scenarios differ from training data, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: Models human pose as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians (one per joint) optimized via differentiable rendering. Introduces a novel one-hot encoding scheme to enable independent optimization of human joints, adapting Gaussian Splatting from dense scene reconstruction to skeleton modeling.

Result: Outperforms approaches without 3D ground truth in Human3.6M and CMU datasets, reducing cross-dataset error up to 47.8% compared to learning-based methods. Demonstrates robustness to occlusions in Human3.6M-Occ and Occlusion-Person datasets without scenario-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SkelSplat provides a robust and generalizable framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation that eliminates the need for 3D ground-truth supervision and shows strong performance across different scenarios and datasets.

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation is fundamental for applications such as augmented reality and human-robot interaction. State-of-the-art multi-view methods learn to fuse predictions across views by training on large annotated datasets, leading to poor generalization when the test scenario differs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkelSplat, a novel framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation based on differentiable Gaussian rendering. Human pose is modeled as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians, one per joint, optimized via differentiable rendering to enable seamless fusion of arbitrary camera views without 3D ground-truth supervision. Since Gaussian Splatting was originally designed for dense scene reconstruction, we propose a novel one-hot encoding scheme that enables independent optimization of human joints. SkelSplat outperforms approaches that do not rely on 3D ground truth in Human3.6M and CMU, while reducing the cross-dataset error up to 47.8% compared to learning-based methods.

TL;DR: NeuSpring: A neural spring field method for creating physical digital twins of deformable objects that improves reconstruction and simulation performance for both current state modeling and future prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on current state modeling but generalize poorly to future prediction because they ignore intrinsic physical properties of deformable objects, limiting physical learning.

Method: Proposes NeuSpring with two innovations: 1) piecewise topology solution using zero-order optimization to model multi-region spring connections considering material heterogeneity, 2) neural spring field using canonical coordinate-based neural network to represent spring physical properties across frames.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction and simulation performance with Chamfer distance improved by 20% for current state modeling and 25% for future prediction on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: NeuSpring effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by incorporating intrinsic physical properties through neural spring fields, enabling better physical learning and generalization to future predictions.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to create physical digital twins of deformable objects under interaction. Existing methods focus more on the physical learning of current state modeling, but generalize worse to future prediction. This is because existing methods ignore the intrinsic physical properties of deformable objects, resulting in the limited physical learning in the current state modeling. To address this, we present NeuSpring, a neural spring field for the reconstruction and simulation of deformable objects from videos. Built upon spring-mass models for realistic physical simulation, our method consists of two major innovations: 1) a piecewise topology solution that efficiently models multi-region spring connection topologies using zero-order optimization, which considers the material heterogeneity of real-world objects. 2) a neural spring field that represents spring physical properties across different frames using a canonical coordinate-based neural network, which effectively leverages the spatial associativity of springs for physical learning. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our NeuSping achieves superior reconstruction and simulation performance for current state modeling and future prediction, with Chamfer distance improved by 20% and 25%, respectively.

*Simone Ricci,Niccolò Biondi,Federico Pernici,Alberto Del Bimbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to reduce negative flips (inconsistencies where updated models misclassify previously correct samples) in image classification by preserving original model margins while learning improved models through margin-calibration and double-source focal distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimizing inconsistencies across successive AI versions is crucial. In image classification, adding new classes reduces margins and introduces conflicting patterns, degrading performance on original classes through negative flips.

Method: Preserves original model margins while learning improved model. Uses explicit margin-calibration term on logits and integrates double-source focal distillation loss with previous model and new independently trained model to learn appropriate decision margins from both old and new data.

Result: Extensive experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate consistent reduction in negative flip rate while maintaining high overall accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively mitigates negative flips by balancing margin preservation for original classes and accuracy for new classes through margin-calibration and dual-source distillation.

Abstract: Minimizing inconsistencies across successive versions of an AI system is as crucial as reducing the overall error. In image classification, such inconsistencies manifest as negative flips, where an updated model misclassifies test samples that were previously classified correctly. This issue becomes increasingly pronounced as the number of training classes grows over time, since adding new categories reduces the margin of each class and may introduce conflicting patterns that undermine their learning process, thereby degrading performance on the original subset. To mitigate negative flips, we propose a novel approach that preserves the margins of the original model while learning an improved one. Our method encourages a larger relative margin between the previously learned and newly introduced classes by introducing an explicit margin-calibration term on the logits. However, overly constraining the logit margin for the new classes can significantly degrade their accuracy compared to a new independently trained model. To address this, we integrate a double-source focal distillation loss with the previous model and a new independently trained model, learning an appropriate decision margin from both old and new data, even under a logit margin calibration. Extensive experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces the negative flip rate with high overall accuracy.

TL;DR: Image-based registration outperforms feature-based and implicit alignment methods for longitudinal mammography risk modeling, providing better predictive accuracy and anatomically plausible deformation fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate spatial alignment across temporal mammograms is crucial for deep learning-based risk models, as misalignment can obscure meaningful tissue changes and degrade performance.

Method: Evaluated various alignment strategies including image-based registration, feature-level alignment with/without regularization, and implicit alignment methods using two large-scale mammography datasets.

Result: Image-based registration consistently outperformed other methods across all metrics, enabling more accurate predictions and generating smooth deformation fields. Feature-level alignment with regularization improved deformation quality but reduced risk prediction performance.

Conclusion: Image-based deformation fields are essential for spatial alignment in longitudinal risk modeling, offering improved prediction accuracy and robustness for personalized breast cancer screening.

Abstract: Regular mammography screening is crucial for early breast cancer detection. By leveraging deep learning-based risk models, screening intervals can be personalized, especially for high-risk individuals. While recent methods increasingly incorporate longitudinal information from prior mammograms, accurate spatial alignment across time points remains a key challenge. Misalignment can obscure meaningful tissue changes and degrade model performance. In this study, we provide insights into various alignment strategies, image-based registration, feature-level (representation space) alignment with and without regularization, and implicit alignment methods, for their effectiveness in longitudinal deep learning-based risk modeling. Using two large-scale mammography datasets, we assess each method across key metrics, including predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and deformation field quality.
  Our results show that image-based registration consistently outperforms the more recently favored feature-based and implicit approaches across all metrics, enabling more accurate, temporally consistent predictions and generating smooth, anatomically plausible deformation fields. Although regularizing the deformation field improves deformation quality, it reduces the risk prediction performance of feature-level alignment. Applying image-based deformation fields within the feature space yields the best risk prediction performance.
  These findings underscore the importance of image-based deformation fields for spatial alignment in longitudinal risk modeling, offering improved prediction accuracy and robustness. This approach has strong potential to enhance personalized screening and enable earlier interventions for high-risk individuals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: sEMG-based gesture recognition systems suffer from limited training data, causing overfitting and poor generalization in deep learning models. Data augmentation can help but faces challenges in balancing faithfulness and diversity.

Method: Proposed SASG-DA with three key components: Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) for faithful generation, Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS) for flexible sampling, and Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling for targeted diversity in underrepresented regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7 datasets show SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods in recognition performance and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively mitigates overfitting and improves gesture recognition by generating both faithful and diverse samples through semantic-guided diffusion augmentation.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG)-based gesture recognition plays a critical role in human-machine interaction (HMI), particularly for rehabilitation and prosthetic control. However, sEMG-based systems often suffer from the scarcity of informative training data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization in deep learning models. Data augmentation offers a promising approach to increasing the size and diversity of training data, where faithfulness and diversity are two critical factors to effectiveness. However, promoting untargeted diversity can result in redundant samples with limited utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based data augmentation approach, Sparse-Aware Semantic-Guided Diffusion Augmentation (SASG-DA). To enhance generation faithfulness, we introduce the Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) mechanism by leveraging fine-grained, task-aware semantic representations as generation conditions. To enable flexible and diverse sample generation, we propose a Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS) strategy, which models the semantic representation distribution and allows stochastic sampling to produce both faithful and diverse samples. To enhance targeted diversity, we further introduce a Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling strategy to explicitly explore underrepresented regions, improving distribution coverage and sample utility. Extensive experiments on benchmark sEMG datasets, Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7, demonstrate that SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods. Overall, our proposed data augmentation approach effectively mitigates overfitting and improves recognition performance and generalization by offering both faithful and diverse samples.

TL;DR: SLOPE combines structured sparsity and low-bit quantization to achieve 20× model size reduction while maintaining ~99% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are too large and computationally expensive for resource-constrained devices. While weight quantization and structured sparsity help individually, their combination severely harms accuracy due to compounded negative effects.

Method: Proposes SLOPE framework with training-time regularization that minimizes discrepancy between full-precision weights and sparse, quantized counterparts by promoting angular alignment rather than direct matching.

Result: Achieves ~20× model size reduction while retaining ~99% of original accuracy on ResNet-18. Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art quantization and structured sparsity methods across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: SLOPE provides a principled way to effectively combine structured sparsity and quantization, enabling significant model compression without substantial accuracy loss.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are used in many applications, but their large size and high computational cost make them hard to run on devices with limited resources. Two widely used techniques to address this challenge are weight quantization, which lowers the precision of all weights, and structured sparsity, which removes unimportant weights while retaining the important ones at full precision. Although both are effective individually, they are typically studied in isolation due to their compounded negative impact on model accuracy when combined. In this work, we introduce SLOPE Structured Sparsity at Low Precision), a unified framework, to effectively combine structured sparsity and low-bit quantization in a principled way. We show that naively combining sparsity and quantization severely harms performance due to the compounded impact of both techniques. To address this, we propose a training-time regularization strategy that minimizes the discrepancy between full-precision weights and their sparse, quantized counterparts by promoting angular alignment rather than direct matching. On ResNet-18, SLOPE achieves $\sim20\times$ model size reduction while retaining $\sim$99% of the original accuracy. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art quantization and structured sparsity methods across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on models such as ResNet-18, ViT-Small, and Mask R-CNN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MRI motion correction methods struggle to generalize across different motion types and body regions, with ML-based approaches often being application-specific.

Method: Hierarchical vector-quantized variational auto-encoder with codebook to capture motion patterns at multiple resolutions, combined with auto-regressive model for motion-free image prior.

Result: Robust correction across varying motion severity on simulated whole-body motion artifacts, effectively disentangling physical motion patterns.

Conclusion: The model improves generalizability of ML-based MRI motion correction and shows potential for application across anatomical regions and motion types.

Abstract: Physiological motion can affect the diagnostic quality of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While various retrospective motion correction methods exist, many struggle to generalize across different motion types and body regions. In particular, machine learning (ML)-based corrections are often tailored to specific applications and datasets. We hypothesize that motion artifacts, though diverse, share underlying patterns that can be disentangled and exploited. To address this, we propose a hierarchical vector-quantized (VQ) variational auto-encoder that learns a disentangled embedding of motion-to-clean image features. A codebook is deployed to capture finite collection of motion patterns at multiple resolutions, enabling coarse-to-fine correction. An auto-regressive model is trained to learn the prior distribution of motion-free images and is used at inference to guide the correction process. Unlike conventional approaches, our method does not require artifact-specific training and can generalize to unseen motion patterns. We demonstrate the approach on simulated whole-body motion artifacts and observe robust correction across varying motion severity. Our results suggest that the model effectively disentangled physical motion of the simulated motion-effective scans, therefore, improving the generalizability of the ML-based MRI motion correction. Our work of disentangling the motion features shed a light on its potential application across anatomical regions and motion types.

Method: Proposed Spherical RoPE, which uses non-commutative generators instead of the commutative generators required for strict equivariance in Mixed RoPE.

Result: Empirical findings show Spherical RoPE has equivalent or better learning behavior compared to equivariant analogues, suggesting relative positional embeddings may not be as important as believed in computer vision.

Conclusion: The discovery should facilitate future positional encoding research in vision by removing the preconception that encodings must be relative, potentially enabling faster and better-generalizing methods.

Abstract: Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE) have emerged as a highly effective technique for one-dimensional sequences in Natural Language Processing spurring recent progress towards generalizing RoPE to higher-dimensional data such as images and videos. The success of RoPE has been thought to be due to its positional equivariance, i.e. its status as a relative positional encoding. In this paper, we mathematically show RoPE to be one of the most general solutions for equivariant positional embedding in one-dimensional data. Moreover, we show Mixed RoPE to be the analogously general solution for M-dimensional data, if we require commutative generators -- a property necessary for RoPE's equivariance. However, we question whether strict equivariance plays a large role in RoPE's performance. We propose Spherical RoPE, a method analogous to Mixed RoPE, but assumes non-commutative generators. Empirically, we find Spherical RoPE to have the equivalent or better learning behavior compared to its equivariant analogues. This suggests that relative positional embeddings are not as important as is commonly believed, at least within computer vision. We expect this discovery to facilitate future work in positional encodings for vision that can be faster and generalize better by removing the preconception that they must be relative.

*Xinyu Zhou,Yu Wu,Jiayao Ma,Wenhao Wang,Min Cao,Mang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Text-based Aerial-Ground Person Retrieval (TAG-PR), a new task that retrieves person images from both aerial and ground views using text descriptions, along with a new dataset TAG-PEDES and TAG-CLIP framework to address view heterogeneity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Text-based Person Retrieval (T-PR) only focuses on ground-view images, but real-world applications often require retrieving persons across heterogeneous aerial and ground views, which introduces significant viewpoint discrepancies.

Method: The authors propose: (1) TAG-PEDES dataset with automatically generated diverse text descriptions, and (2) TAG-CLIP framework featuring a hierarchically-routed mixture of experts module to learn view-specific/agnostic features and viewpoint decoupling strategy for better cross-modal alignment.

Result: The proposed TAG-CLIP framework is evaluated on both the new TAG-PEDES dataset and existing T-PR benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness in handling view heterogeneity.

Conclusion: TAG-PR addresses the practical need for cross-view person retrieval, and the proposed dataset and framework provide effective solutions for this challenging task with significant viewpoint discrepancies.

Abstract: This work introduces Text-based Aerial-Ground Person Retrieval (TAG-PR), which aims to retrieve person images from heterogeneous aerial and ground views with textual descriptions. Unlike traditional Text-based Person Retrieval (T-PR), which focuses solely on ground-view images, TAG-PR introduces greater practical significance and presents unique challenges due to the large viewpoint discrepancy across images. To support this task, we contribute: (1) TAG-PEDES dataset, constructed from public benchmarks with automatically generated textual descriptions, enhanced by a diversified text generation paradigm to ensure robustness under view heterogeneity; and (2) TAG-CLIP, a novel retrieval framework that addresses view heterogeneity through a hierarchically-routed mixture of experts module to learn view-specific and view-agnostic features and a viewpoint decoupling strategy to decouple view-specific features for better cross-modal alignment. We evaluate the effectiveness of TAG-CLIP on both the proposed TAG-PEDES dataset and existing T-PR benchmarks. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Flame-Chasers/TAG-PR.

TL;DR: Anatomy-VLM is a fine-grained vision-language model that incorporates multi-scale anatomical information for improved radiology disease diagnosis by localizing key anatomical features and enriching them with structured knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models treat images holistically and overlook fine-grained details crucial for disease diagnosis, while clinicians analyze images by identifying anatomical structures as important regions of interest using their medical knowledge.

Method: The model localizes key anatomical features from medical images, enriches these regions with structured knowledge for contextual interpretation, and aligns multi-scale medical information to generate clinically-interpretable disease predictions.

Result: Anatomy-VLM achieves outstanding performance on both in- and out-of-distribution datasets, validates well on downstream image segmentation tasks, and facilitates zero-shot anatomy-wise interpretation.

Conclusion: Anatomy-VLM demonstrates strong expert-level clinical interpretation capabilities by capturing fine-grained anatomical and pathology-related knowledge through its multi-scale alignment approach.

Abstract: Accurate disease interpretation from radiology remains challenging due to imaging heterogeneity. Achieving expert-level diagnostic decisions requires integration of subtle image features with clinical knowledge. Yet major vision-language models (VLMs) treat images as holistic entities and overlook fine-grained image details that are vital for disease diagnosis. Clinicians analyze images by utilizing their prior medical knowledge and identify anatomical structures as important region of interests (ROIs). Inspired from this human-centric workflow, we introduce Anatomy-VLM, a fine-grained, vision-language model that incorporates multi-scale information. First, we design a model encoder to localize key anatomical features from entire medical images. Second, these regions are enriched with structured knowledge for contextually-aware interpretation. Finally, the model encoder aligns multi-scale medical information to generate clinically-interpretable disease prediction. Anatomy-VLM achieves outstanding performance on both in- and out-of-distribution datasets. We also validate the performance of Anatomy-VLM on downstream image segmentation tasks, suggesting that its fine-grained alignment captures anatomical and pathology-related knowledge. Furthermore, the Anatomy-VLM's encoder facilitates zero-shot anatomy-wise interpretation, providing its strong expert-level clinical interpretation capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniAID is a novel AIGI detection framework that uses a decoupled Mixture-of-Experts architecture to separate content-specific flaws from universal artifacts, achieving superior generalization across diverse generative models and semantic content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIGI detectors learn entangled forgery representations that conflate content-dependent flaws with content-agnostic artifacts, and are constrained by outdated benchmarks, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes a hybrid expert system with Routable Specialized Semantic Experts for distinct content domains and a Fixed Universal Artifact Expert, trained using a two-stage strategy with domain-specific hard-sampling and lightweight gating network.

Result: Extensive experiments on traditional benchmarks and the new Mirage dataset show OmniAID surpasses existing monolithic detectors, establishing a new robust standard for AIGI authentication.

Conclusion: By explicitly decoupling content-specific flaws from universal artifacts, OmniAID achieves robust generalization against modern, in-the-wild threats in AIGI detection.

Abstract: A truly universal AI-Generated Image (AIGI) detector must simultaneously generalize across diverse generative models and varied semantic content. Current state-of-the-art methods learn a single, entangled forgery representation--conflating content-dependent flaws with content-agnostic artifacts--and are further constrained by outdated benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we propose OmniAID, a novel framework centered on a decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The core of our method is a hybrid expert system engineered to decouple: (1) semantic flaws across distinct content domains, and (2) these content-dependent flaws from content-agnostic universal artifacts. This system employs a set of Routable Specialized Semantic Experts, each for a distinct domain (e.g., human, animal), complemented by a Fixed Universal Artifact Expert. This architecture is trained using a bespoke two-stage strategy: we first train the experts independently with domain-specific hard-sampling to ensure specialization, and subsequently train a lightweight gating network for effective input routing. By explicitly decoupling "what is generated" (content-specific flaws) from "how it is generated" (universal artifacts), OmniAID achieves robust generalization. To address outdated benchmarks and validate real-world applicability, we introduce Mirage, a new large-scale, contemporary dataset. Extensive experiments, using both traditional benchmarks and our Mirage dataset, demonstrate our model surpasses existing monolithic detectors, establishing a new, robust standard for AIGI authentication against modern, in-the-wild threats.

Conclusion: The validated methodology establishes a robust foundation for building high-accuracy, deployable systems for automated hematological diagnosis.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive methodology and comparative performance analysis for the automated classification and object detection of peripheral blood cells (PBCs) in microscopic images. Addressing the critical challenge of data scarcity and heterogeneity, robust data pipeline was first developed to standardize and merge four public datasets (PBC, BCCD, Chula, Sickle Cell) into a unified resource. Then employed a state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN object detection framework, leveraging a ResNet-50-FPN backbone. Comparative training rigorously evaluated a randomly initialized baseline model (Regimen 1) against a Transfer Learning Regimen (Regimen 2), initialized with weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset. The results demonstrate that the Transfer Learning approach achieved significantly faster convergence and superior stability, culminating in a final validation loss of 0.08666, a substantial improvement over the baseline. This validated methodology establishes a robust foundation for building high-accuracy, deployable systems for automated hematological diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To effectively exploit unlabeled data for semi-supervised medical image segmentation by leveraging consistency learning and uncertainty minimization.

Method: Proposes DBPNet with encoder and two slightly different decoders producing pyramid predictions, and CPCR learning strategy combining consistency learning with novel cross-pyramid regularization.

Result: Outperforms five state-of-the-art SSL methods and achieves comparable performance with recent methods on public benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: The hybrid consistency learning approach with cross-pyramid regularization effectively improves semi-supervised medical image segmentation performance.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) enables training of powerful models with the assumption of limited, carefully labelled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to support the learning. In this paper, we propose a hybrid consistency learning approach to effectively exploit unlabeled data for semi-supervised medical image segmentation by leveraging Cross-Pyramid Consistency Regularization (CPCR) between two decoders. First, we design a hybrid Dual Branch Pyramid Network (DBPNet), consisting of an encoder and two decoders that differ slightly, each producing a pyramid of perturbed auxiliary predictions across multiple resolution scales. Second, we present a learning strategy for this network named CPCR that combines existing consistency learning and uncertainty minimization approaches on the main output predictions of decoders with our novel regularization term. More specifically, in this term, we extend the soft-labeling setting to pyramid predictions across decoders to support knowledge distillation in deep hierarchical features. Experimental results show that DBPNet with CPCR outperforms five state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods and has comparable performance with recent ones on a public benchmark dataset.

TL;DR: CIG is a novel attribution method for WSI analysis that computes contrastive gradients in logit space to highlight class-discriminative regions, satisfying theoretical axioms and outperforming existing methods on cancer datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attribution methods like IG capture model decision patterns but may miss class-discriminative signals crucial for distinguishing tumor subtypes in WSI analysis, limiting interpretability in AI-assisted diagnostics.

Method: Contrastive Integrated Gradients (CIG) computes contrastive gradients in logit space by comparing feature importance relative to a reference class, and introduces MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC metrics to evaluate attribution quality under weak supervision.

Result: CIG produces more informative attributions on CAMELYON16, TCGA-RCC, and TCGA-Lung datasets, with quantitative improvements on MIL-AIC/MIL-SIC metrics and qualitative alignment with ground truth tumor regions.

Conclusion: CIG enhances interpretability in WSI-based diagnostics by providing sharper differentiation between tumor subtypes while maintaining theoretical soundness, supporting trustworthy AI-assisted pathology.

Abstract: Interpretability is essential in Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis for computational pathology, where understanding model predictions helps build trust in AI-assisted diagnostics. While Integrated Gradients (IG) and related attribution methods have shown promise, applying them directly to WSIs introduces challenges due to their high-resolution nature. These methods capture model decision patterns but may overlook class-discriminative signals that are crucial for distinguishing between tumor subtypes. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Integrated Gradients (CIG), a novel attribution method that enhances interpretability by computing contrastive gradients in logit space. First, CIG highlights class-discriminative regions by comparing feature importance relative to a reference class, offering sharper differentiation between tumor and non-tumor areas. Second, CIG satisfies the axioms of integrated attribution, ensuring consistency and theoretical soundness. Third, we propose two attribution quality metrics, MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, which measure how predictive information and model confidence evolve with access to salient regions, particularly under weak supervision. We validate CIG across three datasets spanning distinct cancer types: CAMELYON16 (breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes), TCGA-RCC (renal cell carcinoma), and TCGA-Lung (lung cancer). Experimental results demonstrate that CIG yields more informative attributions both quantitatively, using MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, and qualitatively, through visualizations that align closely with ground truth tumor regions, underscoring its potential for interpretable and trustworthy WSI-based diagnostics

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SENCA-st is a novel architecture that integrates histopathology images and spatial transcriptomics data for tumor region segmentation, using cross-attention to preserve features from both modalities and identify structurally similar but functionally different regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods either overemphasize spatial transcriptomics (losing structural information) or histopathology images (losing functional information), leading to loss of essential information in tumor substructure identification.

Method: Proposed SENCA-st (Shared Encoder with Neighborhood Cross Attention) architecture that uses cross-attention to emphasize regions that are structurally similar in histopathology but functionally different in spatial transcriptomics.

Result: The model demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in detecting tumor heterogeneity and tumor micro-environment regions.

Conclusion: SENCA-st effectively integrates both modalities and preserves essential information, making it clinically crucial for identifying tumor substructures associated with cancer drug resistance.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics is an emerging field that enables the identification of functional regions based on the spatial distribution of gene expression. Integrating this functional information present in transcriptomic data with structural data from histopathology images is an active research area with applications in identifying tumor substructures associated with cancer drug resistance. Current histopathology-spatial-transcriptomic region segmentation methods suffer due to either making spatial transcriptomics prominent by using histopathology features just to assist processing spatial transcriptomics data or using vanilla contrastive learning that make histopathology images prominent due to only promoting common features losing functional information. In both extremes, the model gets either lost in the noise of spatial transcriptomics or overly smoothed, losing essential information. Thus, we propose our novel architecture SENCA-st (Shared Encoder with Neighborhood Cross Attention) that preserves the features of both modalities. More importantly, it emphasizes regions that are structurally similar in histopathology but functionally different on spatial transcriptomics using cross-attention. We demonstrate the superior performance of our model that surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting tumor heterogeneity and tumor micro-environment regions, a clinically crucial aspect.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To decouple comprehensive input understanding from discriminative feature learning in VLMs, enabling efficient transformation into embedding models.

Method: Proposes CoMa - a compressed pre-training phase as warm-up for contrastive learning, requiring only small pre-training data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results among comparable-size VLMs on MMEB benchmark, optimizing both efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: CoMa successfully demonstrates that VLMs can be efficiently adapted into high-performance embedding models through compressed pre-training.

Abstract: Vision-language models advance multimodal representation learning by acquiring transferable semantic embeddings, thereby substantially enhancing performance across a range of vision-language tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. An effective embedding is expected to comprehensively preserve the semantic content of the input while simultaneously emphasizing features that are discriminative for downstream tasks. Recent approaches demonstrate that VLMs can be adapted into competitive embedding models via large-scale contrastive learning, enabling the simultaneous optimization of two complementary objectives. We argue that the two aforementioned objectives can be decoupled: a comprehensive understanding of the input facilitates the embedding model in achieving superior performance in downstream tasks via contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose CoMa, a compressed pre-training phase, which serves as a warm-up stage for contrastive learning. Experiments demonstrate that with only a small amount of pre-training data, we can transform a VLM into a competitive embedding model. CoMa achieves new state-of-the-art results among VLMs of comparable size on the MMEB, realizing optimization in both efficiency and effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for 3D medical image segmentation consume significant time and memory when processing entire volumes voxel-by-voxel, creating a trade-off between speed and accuracy.

Method: Proposed hierarchical sparse sampling strategy to reduce computation while preserving hierarchical context, combined with Residual Transformer architecture to extract and combine information from different resolution levels efficiently.

Result: Achieved improved qualitative and quantitative segmentation performance compared to current fast organ classifiers, with processing speed of ~2.24 seconds on CPU hardware using internal dataset of 10,253 CT images and public TotalSegmentator dataset.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for real-time fine organ segmentation with fast speed and maintained accuracy.

Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation of 3D medical images is fundamental with meaningful applications in various clinical automation pipelines. Although deep learning has achieved superior performance, the time and memory consumption of segmenting the entire 3D volume voxel by voxel using neural networks can be huge. Classifiers have been developed as an alternative in cases with certain points of interest, but the trade-off between speed and accuracy remains an issue. Thus, we propose a novel fast multi-organ segmentation framework with the usage of hierarchical sparse sampling and a Residual Transformer. Compared with whole-volume analysis, the hierarchical sparse sampling strategy could successfully reduce computation time while preserving a meaningful hierarchical context utilizing multiple resolution levels. The architecture of the Residual Transformer segmentation network could extract and combine information from different levels of information in the sparse descriptor while maintaining a low computational cost. In an internal data set containing 10,253 CT images and the public dataset TotalSegmentator, the proposed method successfully improved qualitative and quantitative segmentation performance compared to the current fast organ classifier, with fast speed at the level of ~2.24 seconds on CPU hardware. The potential of achieving real-time fine organ segmentation is suggested.

Motivation: Real-world video applications require complex, iterative workflows combining multiple AI capabilities, but current specialized models only excel at isolated tasks, creating a gap for unified video processing systems.

Method: Uses Plan-and-Act dual-agent architecture: planner agent interprets user intentions and decomposes tasks, executor agents execute through modular MCP-based tool servers. Features hierarchical multi-level memory for long-horizon reasoning and contextual continuity.

Result: Enables iterative any-conditioned video workflows (text/image/video-conditioned generation → multi-round editing → object segmentation → compositional synthesis) that were previously cumbersome. Also introduces UniVA-Bench benchmark for evaluation.

Conclusion: UniVA and UniVA-Bench are fully open-sourced to catalyze research on interactive, agentic, and general-purpose video intelligence for next-generation multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: While specialized AI models excel at isolated video tasks like generation or understanding, real-world applications demand complex, iterative workflows that combine these capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce UniVA, an open-source, omni-capable multi-agent framework for next-generation video generalists that unifies video understanding, segmentation, editing, and generation into cohesive workflows. UniVA employs a Plan-and-Act dual-agent architecture that drives a highly automated and proactive workflow: a planner agent interprets user intentions and decomposes them into structured video-processing steps, while executor agents execute these through modular, MCP-based tool servers (for analysis, generation, editing, tracking, etc.). Through a hierarchical multi-level memory (global knowledge, task context, and user-specific preferences), UniVA sustains long-horizon reasoning, contextual continuity, and inter-agent communication, enabling interactive and self-reflective video creation with full traceability. This design enables iterative and any-conditioned video workflows (e.g., text/image/video-conditioned generation $\rightarrow$ multi-round editing $\rightarrow$ object segmentation $\rightarrow$ compositional synthesis) that were previously cumbersome to achieve with single-purpose models or monolithic video-language models. We also introduce UniVA-Bench, a benchmark suite of multi-step video tasks spanning understanding, editing, segmentation, and generation, to rigorously evaluate such agentic video systems. Both UniVA and UniVA-Bench are fully open-sourced, aiming to catalyze research on interactive, agentic, and general-purpose video intelligence for the next generation of multimodal AI systems.

Motivation: To improve digital communication accessibility for hearing-impaired individuals and explore how LLMs can process embodied multimodal languages beyond text-based inputs.

Method: Leverages LLMs as backbone with 3D sign language data, using both direct translation from 3D gesture features to text and instruction-guided translation modulated by external prompts.

Result: Enables more accurate and resilient ASL translation by capturing rich spatial, gestural, and depth information in 3D scenes.

Conclusion: Provides foundational step toward inclusive multimodal intelligent systems capable of understanding diverse forms of language beyond text.

Abstract: We present Large Sign Language Models (LSLM), a novel framework for translating 3D American Sign Language (ASL) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as the backbone, which can benefit hearing-impaired individuals' virtual communication. Unlike existing sign language recognition methods that rely on 2D video, our approach directly utilizes 3D sign language data to capture rich spatial, gestural, and depth information in 3D scenes. This enables more accurate and resilient translation, enhancing digital communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. Beyond the task of ASL translation, our work explores the integration of complex, embodied multimodal languages into the processing capabilities of LLMs, moving beyond purely text-based inputs to broaden their understanding of human communication. We investigate both direct translation from 3D gesture features to text and an instruction-guided setting where translations can be modulated by external prompts, offering greater flexibility. This work provides a foundational step toward inclusive, multimodal intelligent systems capable of understanding diverse forms of language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF-based methods rely on accurate camera poses and produce implicit representations incompatible with standard 3D software, limiting practical robotic applications.

Method: Jointly refines camera poses while learning implicit scene representation, then converts to editable 3D meshes compatible with standard graphics tools.

Result: Achieves accurate and robust 3D reconstruction under pose uncertainty on standard benchmarks, producing high-quality meshes with fine geometric detail.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between neural implicit representations and practical robotic applications by providing editable meshes compatible with common 3D tools.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from multi-view images is essential for downstream robotic tasks such as navigation, manipulation, and environment understanding. However, obtaining precise camera poses in real-world settings remains challenging, even when calibration parameters are known. This limits the practicality of existing NeRF-based methods that rely heavily on accurate extrinsic estimates. Furthermore, their implicit volumetric representations differ significantly from the widely adopted polygonal meshes, making rendering and manipulation inefficient in standard 3D software. In this work, we propose a robust framework that reconstructs high-quality, editable 3D meshes directly from multi-view images with noisy extrinsic parameters. Our approach jointly refines camera poses while learning an implicit scene representation that captures fine geometric detail and photorealistic appearance. The resulting meshes are compatible with common 3D graphics and robotics tools, enabling efficient downstream use. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves accurate and robust 3D reconstruction under pose uncertainty, bridging the gap between neural implicit representations and practical robotic applications.

Result: RMSE of 0.55m indoors, 13.59m outdoors on DeepMIMO; 3.45m on ViWi outdoor blockage scenario; outperforms state-of-the-art by ~38%.

Conclusion: The proposed attention-based ViT scheme significantly improves UE positioning accuracy and error distribution compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Recently, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been used for User Equipment (UE) positioning. However, the key shortcomings of such models is that: i) they weigh the same attention to the entire input; ii) they are not well suited for the non-sequential data e.g., when only instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) is available. In this context, we propose an attention-based Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that focuses on the Angle Delay Profile (ADP) from CSI matrix. Our approach, validated on the `DeepMIMO' and `ViWi' ray-tracing datasets, achieves an Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.55m indoors, 13.59m outdoors in DeepMIMO, and 3.45m in ViWi's outdoor blockage scenario. The proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art schemes by $\sim$ 38\%. It also performs substantially better than other approaches that we have considered in terms of the distribution of error distance.

### [118] [EvoPS: Evolutionary Patch Selection for Whole Slide Image Analysis in Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07560)
*Saya Hashemian,Azam Asilian Bidgoli*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: EvoPS is an evolutionary patch selection framework that optimizes the trade-off between computational cost and diagnostic accuracy in whole-slide image analysis by selecting minimal patch embeddings while maintaining or improving classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current patch selection methods for whole-slide images rely on random sampling or simple heuristics, failing to explicitly manage the crucial trade-off between computational cost (number of patches) and diagnostic accuracy.

Method: Formulates patch selection as a multi-objective optimization problem using evolutionary search to simultaneously minimize the number of selected patch embeddings and maximize downstream similarity search performance, generating a Pareto front of optimal solutions.

Result: Validated on four major cancer cohorts from TCGA using five pretrained models, EvoPS reduced required training patch embeddings by over 90% while maintaining or improving F1-score compared to using all available patches.

Conclusion: EvoPS provides a robust and principled method for creating efficient, accurate, and interpretable WSI representations, enabling optimal balance between computational cost and diagnostic performance.

Abstract: In computational pathology, the gigapixel scale of Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) necessitates their division into thousands of smaller patches. Analyzing these high-dimensional patch embeddings is computationally expensive and risks diluting key diagnostic signals with many uninformative patches. Existing patch selection methods often rely on random sampling or simple clustering heuristics and typically fail to explicitly manage the crucial trade-off between the number of selected patches and the accuracy of the resulting slide representation. To address this gap, we propose EvoPS (Evolutionary Patch Selection), a novel framework that formulates patch selection as a multi-objective optimization problem and leverages an evolutionary search to simultaneously minimize the number of selected patch embeddings and maximize the performance of a downstream similarity search task, generating a Pareto front of optimal trade-off solutions. We validated our framework across four major cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using five pretrained deep learning models to generate patch embeddings, including both supervised CNNs and large self-supervised foundation models. The results demonstrate that EvoPS can reduce the required number of training patch embeddings by over 90% while consistently maintaining or even improving the final classification F1-score compared to a baseline that uses all available patches' embeddings selected through a standard extraction pipeline. The EvoPS framework provides a robust and principled method for creating efficient, accurate, and interpretable WSI representations, empowering users to select an optimal balance between computational cost and diagnostic performance.

### [119] [Deep Learning Analysis of Prenatal Ultrasound for Identification of Ventriculomegaly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07827)
*Youssef Megahed,Inok Lee,Robin Ducharme,Aylin Erman,Olivier X. Miguel,Kevin Dick,Adrian D. C. Chan,Steven Hawken,Mark Walker,Felipe Moretti*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Developed a deep learning model using fine-tuned Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE) for detecting ventriculomegaly on prenatal ultrasound images, achieving high performance with F1-scores over 91% and demonstrating clinical plausibility through attention visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ventriculomegaly is a prenatal condition with dilated cerebral ventricles that requires early diagnosis due to association with increased risk for fetal aneuploidies and genetic syndromes. Current detection methods need improvement for accurate and timely diagnosis.

Method: Fine-tuned USF-MAE (Vision Transformer encoder pretrained on 370,000+ ultrasound images) for binary classification of normal vs ventriculomegaly fetal brain ultrasound images. Used 5-fold cross-validation and independent test cohort evaluation with multiple performance metrics.

Result: USF-MAE achieved F1-scores of 91.76% (cross-validation) and 91.78% (test set), significantly outperforming baseline models (VGG-19, ResNet-50, ViT-B/16). Model showed 94.47% precision and 97.24% accuracy. Eigen-CAM heatmaps confirmed model focused on ventricle area.

Conclusion: The USF-MAE model provides accurate and clinically plausible detection of ventriculomegaly, demonstrating the effectiveness of self-supervised foundation models for medical imaging tasks and offering explainable AI for prenatal diagnosis.

Abstract: The proposed study aimed to develop a deep learning model capable of detecting ventriculomegaly on prenatal ultrasound images. Ventriculomegaly is a prenatal condition characterized by dilated cerebral ventricles of the fetal brain and is important to diagnose early, as it can be associated with an increased risk for fetal aneuploidies and/or underlying genetic syndromes. An Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), recently developed by our group, was fine-tuned for a binary classification task to distinguish fetal brain ultrasound images as either normal or showing ventriculomegaly. The USF-MAE incorporates a Vision Transformer encoder pretrained on more than 370,000 ultrasound images from the OpenUS-46 corpus. For this study, the pretrained encoder was adapted and fine-tuned on a curated dataset of fetal brain ultrasound images to optimize its performance for ventriculomegaly detection. Model evaluation was conducted using 5-fold cross-validation and an independent test cohort, and performance was quantified using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The proposed USF-MAE model reached an F1-score of 91.76% on the 5-fold cross-validation and 91.78% on the independent test set, with much higher scores than those obtained by the baseline models by 19.37% and 16.15% compared to VGG-19, 2.31% and 2.56% compared to ResNet-50, and 5.03% and 11.93% compared to ViT-B/16, respectively. The model also showed a high mean test precision of 94.47% and an accuracy of 97.24%. The Eigen-CAM (Eigen Class Activation Map) heatmaps showed that the model was focusing on the ventricle area for the diagnosis of ventriculomegaly, which has explainability and clinical plausibility.

*Youneng Bao,Yulong Cheng,Yiping Liu,Yichen Yang,Peng Qin,Mu Li,Yongsheng Liang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DynaQuant is a dynamic mixed-precision quantization framework for Learned Image Compression that adapts bit-widths to data distributions and layer sensitivities using content-aware quantization and dynamic bit-width selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static uniform quantization in LIC fails to adapt to diverse data distributions and sensitivity characteristics, leading to suboptimal performance-efficiency trade-offs.

Method: Two-level approach: 1) Content-aware quantization with learnable scaling/offset parameters trained via Distance-aware Gradient Modulator; 2) Dynamic bit-width selector that assigns optimal precision per layer based on input data.

Result: Achieves rate-distortion performance comparable to full-precision models while significantly reducing computational and storage requirements.

Conclusion: Enables practical deployment of advanced LIC on diverse hardware platforms through flexible balancing of performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Prevailing quantization techniques in Learned Image Compression (LIC) typically employ a static, uniform bit-width across all layers, failing to adapt to the highly diverse data distributions and sensitivity characteristics inherent in LIC models. This leads to a suboptimal trade-off between performance and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DynaQuant, a novel framework for dynamic mixed-precision quantization that operates on two complementary levels. First, we propose content-aware quantization, where learnable scaling and offset parameters dynamically adapt to the statistical variations of latent features. This fine-grained adaptation is trained end-to-end using a novel Distance-aware Gradient Modulator (DGM), which provides a more informative learning signal than the standard Straight-Through Estimator. Second, we introduce a data-driven, dynamic bit-width selector that learns to assign an optimal bit precision to each layer, dynamically reconfiguring the network's precision profile based on the input data. Our fully dynamic approach offers substantial flexibility in balancing rate-distortion (R-D) performance and computational cost. Experiments demonstrate that DynaQuant achieves rd performance comparable to full-precision models while significantly reducing computational and storage requirements, thereby enabling the practical deployment of advanced LIC on diverse hardware platforms.

*Chaoyi Lin,Yaojun Wu,Yue Li,Junru Li,Kai Zhang,Li Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel image compression method that generates image-specific latents from Gaussian noise using a shared random seed, eliminating the need to transmit latent codes while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between implicit neural representation methods (which lack expressive latents) and end-to-end methods (which require transmitting complex latent codes), by exploring inverse Gaussian transformation for latent generation.

Method: Uses a Gaussian Parameter Prediction module to estimate distribution parameters from Gaussian noise, enabling one-shot latent generation via reparameterization trick, followed by synthesis network for image reconstruction.

Result: Achieves competitive rate-distortion performance on Kodak and CLIC datasets without transmitting latent codes.

Conclusion: First work to explore Gaussian latent generation for learned image compression, offering a new paradigm that preserves latent-based benefits while eliminating latent transmission.

Abstract: Recent implicit neural representation (INR)-based image compression methods have shown competitive performance by overfitting image-specific latent codes. However, they remain inferior to end-to-end (E2E) compression approaches due to the absence of expressive latent representations. On the other hand, E2E methods rely on transmitting latent codes and requiring complex entropy models, leading to increased decoding complexity. Inspired by the normalization strategy in E2E codecs where latents are transformed into Gaussian noise to demonstrate the removal of spatial redundancy, we explore the inverse direction: generating latents directly from Gaussian noise. In this paper, we propose a novel image compression paradigm that reconstructs image-specific latents from a multi-scale Gaussian noise tensor, deterministically generated using a shared random seed. A Gaussian Parameter Prediction (GPP) module estimates the distribution parameters, enabling one-shot latent generation via reparameterization trick. The predicted latent is then passed through a synthesis network to reconstruct the image. Our method eliminates the need to transmit latent codes while preserving latent-based benefits, achieving competitive rate-distortion performance on Kodak and CLIC dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore Gaussian latent generation for learned image compression.

### [122] [Analysing Environmental Efficiency in AI for X-Ray Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07436)
*Liam Kearns*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Comparison of LLMs vs small discriminative models for COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays, showing smaller models reduce carbon footprint but may have bias, while LLMs perform poorly when restricted to probabilistic outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark AI model performance and environmental impact in medical diagnosis, addressing the trend of using versatile LLMs over specialized smaller models despite potential inefficiencies.

Method: Integrated 14 different model configurations (LLMs and discriminative models) into a Mendix application for COVID-19 detection, using discriminative models as knowledge bases for LLMs to improve accuracy.

Result: Smaller models reduced carbon footprint but showed bias toward positive diagnoses with low confidence. LLMs performed poorly when restricted to probabilistic outputs. Covid-Net achieved highest accuracy (95.5%) with 99.9% lower carbon footprint than GPT-4.5-Preview.

Conclusion: Discriminative models are more efficient than LLMs for classification tasks in medical applications, highlighting environmental risks of using generative tools for such purposes.

Abstract: The integration of AI tools into medical applications has aimed to improve the efficiency of diagnosis. The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, has expanded this integration even further. Because of LLM versatility and ease of use through APIs, these larger models are often utilised even though smaller, custom models can be used instead. In this paper, LLMs and small discriminative models are integrated into a Mendix application to detect Covid-19 in chest X-rays. These discriminative models are also used to provide knowledge bases for LLMs to improve accuracy. This provides a benchmark study of 14 different model configurations for comparison of accuracy and environmental impact. The findings indicated that while smaller models reduced the carbon footprint of the application, the output was biased towards a positive diagnosis and the output probabilities were lacking confidence. Meanwhile, restricting LLMs to only give probabilistic output caused poor performance in both accuracy and carbon footprint, demonstrating the risk of using LLMs as a universal AI solution. While using the smaller LLM GPT-4.1-Nano reduced the carbon footprint by 94.2% compared to the larger models, this was still disproportionate to the discriminative models; the most efficient solution was the Covid-Net model. Although it had a larger carbon footprint than other small models, its carbon footprint was 99.9% less than when using GPT-4.5-Preview, whilst achieving an accuracy of 95.5%, the highest of all models examined. This paper contributes to knowledge by comparing generative and discriminative models in Covid-19 detection as well as highlighting the environmental risk of using generative tools for classification tasks.

### [124] [Beyond Correctness: Confidence-Aware Reward Modeling for Enhancing Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07483)
*Qianxi He,Qingyu Ren,Shanzhe Lei,Xuhong Wang,Yingchun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A confidence-based reward model for STEM reasoning that penalizes low-confidence correct answers to improve reasoning quality in smaller LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based RL rewards often lead to poor reasoning chains and inconsistencies in smaller models, limiting their potential for resource-constrained organizations.

Method: Proposed a confidence-based reward model that penalizes both incorrect answers and low-confidence correct responses, validated through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference, and PPO-based RL training.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art open-source reward models across diverse STEM benchmarks.

Conclusion: The confidence-based approach effectively enhances reasoning robustness and logical consistency in smaller-scale language models for STEM tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted the post-training paradigm from traditional instruction tuning and human preference alignment toward reinforcement learning (RL) focused on reasoning capabilities. However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art open-source reward models across diverse STEM benchmarks. We release our codes and model in https://github.com/qianxiHe147/C2RM.

*Vincent Hsiao,Mark Roberts,Leslie Smith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using hierarchical task networks (HTNs) as procedural knowledge dramatically improves LLM performance on agentic tasks, allowing smaller models to outperform larger baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with agentic tasks without extensive tool support or fine-tuning, and procedural knowledge could potentially improve their planning efficiency.

Method: Implemented an agentic LLM workflow that leverages procedural knowledge in the form of hierarchical task networks (HTNs), testing both hand-coded and LLM-created HTNs.

Result: Hand-coded HTNs dramatically improved LLM performance, boosting 20b/70b parameter models to outperform 120b parameter baseline. LLM-created HTNs also improved performance but less effectively.

Conclusion: Leveraging expertise to curate procedural knowledge will become an important tool for improving LLM workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle when performing agentic tasks without substantial tool support, prom-pt engineering, or fine tuning. Despite research showing that domain-dependent, procedural knowledge can dramatically increase planning efficiency, little work evaluates its potential for improving LLM performance on agentic tasks that may require implicit planning. We formalize, implement, and evaluate an agentic LLM workflow that leverages procedural knowledge in the form of a hierarchical task network (HTN). Empirical results of our implementation show that hand-coded HTNs can dramatically improve LLM performance on agentic tasks, and using HTNs can boost a 20b or 70b parameter LLM to outperform a much larger 120b parameter LLM baseline. Furthermore, LLM-created HTNs improve overall performance, though less so. The results suggest that leveraging expertise--from humans, documents, or LLMs--to curate procedural knowledge will become another important tool for improving LLM workflows.

TL;DR: Orion is a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies, outperforming much larger retrievers on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches fall short: neural retrievers lack reasoning capabilities, LLMs provide semantic depth but at prohibitive cost, and query rewriting/decomposition limits improvement to static transformations. Existing methods fail to capture iterative dynamics of exploration, feedback, and revision that complex queries demand.

Method: Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning for diverse exploration patterns, (2) reinforcement learning that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking behaviors, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms that exploit self-reflection capabilities learned during RL.

Result: The 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% prior), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on FEVER, HotpotQA, and MSMarco. It outperforms retrievers up to 200-400x larger on five of six benchmarks, using only 3% of training data.

Conclusion: Retrieval performance can emerge from learned strategies, not just model scale, when models are trained to search, reflect, and revise.

Abstract: Effective information retrieval requires reasoning over partial evidence and refining strategies as information emerges. Yet current approaches fall short: neural retrievers lack reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide semantic depth but at prohibitive cost, and query rewriting or decomposition limits improvement to static transformations. As a result, existing methods fail to capture the iterative dynamics of exploration, feedback, and revision that complex user queries demand. We introduce Orion, a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies. Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning to encourage diverse exploration patterns in models, (2) reinforcement learning (RL) that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking behaviors, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms that exploit the self-reflection capabilities learned during RL. Despite using only 3% of the training data available, our 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% for prior retrievers), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on FEVER, HotpotQA, and MSMarco. It outperforms retrievers up to 200-400x larger on five of six benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GSW is a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that enables LLMs to reason over evolving situations by building structured, interpretable representations, outperforming RAG baselines by up to 20% on long-context tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long-context reasoning due to finite context windows and performance degradation with sequence length, while current retrieval methods fail to build narrative representations needed for tracking entities through episodic events.

Method: GSW framework with an Operator that maps observations to semantic structures and a Reconciler that integrates them into a persistent workspace enforcing temporal, spatial, and logical coherence.

Result: Outperforms RAG baselines by up to 20% on Episodic Memory Benchmark (100k-1M tokens), reduces query-time context tokens by 51%, and significantly cuts inference time costs.

Conclusion: GSW provides a blueprint for endowing LLMs with human-like episodic memory, enabling more capable agents that can reason over long horizons.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in long-context reasoning: many documents exceed their finite context windows, while performance on texts that do fit degrades with sequence length, necessitating their augmentation with external memory frameworks. Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \textbf{20\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \textbf{51\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably. More broadly, GSW offers a concrete blueprint for endowing LLMs with human-like episodic memory, paving the way for more capable agents that can reason over long horizons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address persistent challenges in equitable assessment of individual contributions in teams, where conflict and workload disparity lead to unfair performance evaluation requiring costly manual intervention.

Method: Organizes heterogeneous artifacts into three dimensions (Contribution, Interaction, Role) with nine benchmarks, normalizes objective measures, aggregates per dimension, uses Gini index for inequality, and employs LLM architecture for validated contextual analysis.

Result: Framework enables identification of conflict markers through inequality measures and generates interpretable, transparent advisory judgments about team contribution disparities.

Conclusion: The proposed AI-enhanced tool is feasible under current policies and addresses practical challenges in team contribution assessment with bias safeguards and transparent analytics.

Abstract: The equitable assessment of individual contribution in teams remains a persistent challenge, where conflict and disparity in workload can result in unfair performance evaluation, often requiring manual intervention - a costly and challenging process. We survey existing tool features and identify a gap in conflict resolution methods and AI integration. To address this, we propose a framework and implementation design for a novel AI-enhanced tool that assists in dispute investigation. The framework organises heterogeneous artefacts - submissions (code, text, media), communications (chat, email), coordination records (meeting logs, tasks), peer assessments, and contextual information - into three dimensions with nine benchmarks: Contribution, Interaction, and Role. Objective measures are normalised, aggregated per dimension, and paired with inequality measures (Gini index) to surface conflict markers. A Large Language Model (LLM) architecture performs validated and contextual analysis over these measures to generate interpretable and transparent advisory judgments. We argue for feasibility under current statutory and institutional policy, and outline practical analytics (sentimental, task fidelity, word/line count, etc.), bias safeguards, limitations, and practical challenges.

*Alejandro R. Jadad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for achieving reliable human-AI partnership in high-stakes strategic decisions, addressing cognitive biases in LLMs through a structured calibration and protection architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs excel in verifiable domains but prove unreliable for high-stakes strategic decisions with uncertain outcomes, threatening defensible valuations and sustainable investments due to cognitive biases in both humans and AI systems.

Method: Systematic qualitative assessment across 7 frontier-grade LLMs and 3 market-facing venture vignettes under time pressure, using detailed prompting and a 7-stage calibration sequence within a 5-layer protection architecture for bias monitoring and partnership verification.

Result: Partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades with architectural drift and context exhaustion; dissolution discipline prevents costly wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.

Conclusion: Human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification is delayed.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel in verifiable domains where outputs can be checked before action but prove less reliable for high-stakes strategic decisions with uncertain outcomes. This gap, driven by mutually reinforcing cognitive biases in both humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, threatens the defensibility of valuations and sustainability of investments in the sector.
  This report describes a framework emerging from systematic qualitative assessment across 7 frontier-grade LLMs and 3 market-facing venture vignettes under time pressure. Detailed prompting specifying decision partnership and explicitly instructing avoidance of sycophancy, confabulation, solution drift, and nihilism achieved initial partnership state but failed to maintain it under operational pressure. Sustaining protective partnership state required an emergent 7-stage calibration sequence, built upon a 4-stage initialization process, within a 5-layer protection architecture enabling bias self-monitoring, human-AI adversarial challenge, partnership state verification, performance degradation detection, and stakeholder protection.
  Three discoveries resulted: partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades when architectural drift and context exhaustion align; and dissolution discipline prevents costly pursuit of fundamentally wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.
  This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late.

The AIA Forecaster approach combines three core elements: agentic search over high-quality news sources, a supervisor agent that reconciles disparate forecasts for the same event, and a set of statistical calibration techniques to counter behavioral biases in large language models. On the ForecastBench benchmark (Karger et al., 2024), the AIA Forecaster achieves performance equal to human superforecasters, surpassing prior LLM baselines. In addition to reporting on ForecastBench, we also introduce a more challenging forecasting benchmark sourced from liquid prediction markets. While the AIA Forecaster underperforms market consensus on this benchmark, an ensemble combining AIA Forecaster with market consensus outperforms consensus alone, demonstrating that our forecaster provides additive information. Our work establishes a new state of the art in AI forecasting and provides practical, transferable recommendations for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that verifiably achieves expert-level forecasting at scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ResearchRubrics is a benchmark for evaluating Deep Research agents using 2,500+ expert-written rubrics across factual grounding, reasoning, and clarity, showing current agents achieve under 68% compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating Deep Research agents is challenging due to lengthy, diverse responses with many valid solutions and dynamic information sources.

Method: Created ResearchRubrics benchmark with 2,800+ human hours, pairing domain-diverse prompts with fine-grained rubrics, plus human and model-based evaluation protocols.

Result: Leading DR agents like Gemini and OpenAI achieve under 68% average rubric compliance, mainly due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information.

Conclusion: There's a need for robust, scalable assessment of deep research capabilities; ResearchRubrics is released to facilitate progress toward well-justified research assistants.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) is an emerging agent application that leverages large language models (LLMs) to address open-ended queries. It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information. Our results highlight the need for robust, scalable assessment of deep research capabilities, to which end we release ResearchRubrics(including all prompts, rubrics, and evaluation code) to facilitate progress toward well-justified research assistants.

*Soham Hans,Volkan Ustun,Benjamin Nye,James Sterrett,Matthew Green*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent LLM framework for generating complex military training scenarios and OPORDs by decomposing the task into hierarchical subproblems with specialized agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scenario generation for military training is labor-intensive, and pre-LLM AI tools failed to produce sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios.

Method: Multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that decomposes scenario generation into hierarchical subproblems, using specialized LLM agents that process both text and visual information sequentially while maintaining logical consistency.

Result: Proof-of-concept successfully generates scheme of maneuver and movement sections of OPORDs while estimating map positions and movements, demonstrating feasibility and accuracy.

Conclusion: LLM-driven multi-agent systems can generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically, advancing automation in military training scenario generation.

Abstract: Achieving expert-level performance in simulation-based training relies on the creation of complex, adaptable scenarios, a traditionally laborious and resource intensive process. Although prior research explored scenario generation for military training, pre-LLM AI tools struggled to generate sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios. This paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate critical training artifacts, such as Operations Orders (OPORDs). We structure our framework by decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems, and for each one, defining the role of the AI tool: (1) generating options for a human author to select from, (2) producing a candidate product for human approval or modification, or (3) generating textual artifacts fully automatically. Our framework employs specialized LLM-based agents to address distinct subproblems. Each agent receives input from preceding subproblem agents, integrating both text-based scenario details and visual information (e.g., map features, unit positions and applies specialized reasoning to produce appropriate outputs. Subsequent agents process these outputs sequentially, preserving logical consistency and ensuring accurate document generation. This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks. We validate our framework through a proof-of-concept that generates the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements as a precursor demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically to changing conditions, advancing automation in scenario generation for military training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Deep learning system deployed in UN's Methane Alert and Response System to automatically detect methane plumes from satellite data, reducing false detections by 74% and enabling rapid verification of 1,351 leaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current satellite-based methane detection methods using matched filters produce too many false positives requiring manual verification, creating operational bottlenecks for global methane monitoring.

Method: Created largest global dataset of annotated methane plumes from three imaging spectrometers, compared deep learning models, used model ensembling, and extended evaluation from tiles to full granules for operational deployment.

Result: System reduced false detections by over 74%, processed 1,351 distinct methane leaks during 7 months of deployment, and enabled 479 stakeholder notifications. Demonstrated utility in verification cases across Libya, Argentina, Oman, and Azerbaijan.

Conclusion: This represents a critical step toward global AI-assisted methane leak detection system needed to handle increasing data volumes from current and future imaging spectrometers.

Abstract: Mitigating anthropogenic methane sources is one the most cost-effective levers to slow down global warming. While satellite-based imaging spectrometers, such as EMIT, PRISMA, and EnMAP, can detect these point sources, current methane retrieval methods based on matched filters still produce a high number of false detections requiring laborious manual verification. This paper describes the operational deployment of a machine learning system for detecting methane emissions within the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) of the United Nations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We created the largest and most diverse global dataset of annotated methane plumes from three imaging spectrometer missions and quantitatively compared different deep learning model configurations. Focusing on the requirements for operational deployment, we extended prior evaluation methodologies from small tiled datasets to full granule evaluation. This revealed that deep learning models still produce a large number of false detections, a problem we address with model ensembling, which reduced false detections by over 74%. Deployed in the MARS pipeline, our system processes scenes and proposes plumes to analysts, accelerating the detection and analysis process. During seven months of operational deployment, it facilitated the verification of 1,351 distinct methane leaks, resulting in 479 stakeholder notifications. We further demonstrate the model's utility in verifying mitigation success through case studies in Libya, Argentina, Oman, and Azerbaijan. Our work represents a critical step towards a global AI-assisted methane leak detection system, which is required to process the dramatically higher data volumes expected from new and current imaging spectrometers.

### [134] [Alignment-Aware Quantization for LLM Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07842)
*Sunghyun Wee,Suyoung Kim,Hyeonjin Kim,Kyomin Hwang,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AAQ addresses safety degradation in quantized LLMs by integrating alignment-preserving contrastive loss into post-training quantization, enabling 4-bit quantization while maintaining safety alignment without specialized datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional PTQ focuses only on perplexity optimization, which can degrade model safety alignment despite low perplexity scores, creating a conflict between efficiency and safety objectives.

Method: Proposes Alignment-Aware Quantization (AAQ) with Alignment-Preserving Contrastive (APC) loss that encourages quantized models to mimic safe instruction-tuned versions while diverging from unaligned pre-trained counterparts.

Result: AAQ enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral models while maintaining safety alignment where previous methods fail, without requiring specialized safety datasets.

Conclusion: AAQ resolves the efficiency-safety trade-off in LLM quantization, paving the way for trustworthy and efficient LLMs through alignment-aware quantization techniques.

Abstract: Safety and efficiency are both important factors when deploying large language models(LLMs). LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, and post training quantization(PTQ) is applied afterward for efficiency. However, these two objectives are often in conflict, revealing a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. Models can demonstrate low perplexity yet exhibit significant degradation in alignment with the safety policy, highlighting that perplexity alone is an insufficient and often misleading proxy for model safety. To address this, we propose Alignment-Aware Quantization(AAQ), a novel approach that integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive(APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline. Compared to simple reconstruction loss, ours explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. Our method achieves this robust safety alignment without resorting to specialized safety-focused calibration datasets, highlighting its practical utility and broad applicability. AAQ is compatible with standard PTQ techniques and enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across diverse model families such as LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral while maintaining safety where previous methods fail. Our work resolves the critical trade-off between efficiency and safety, paving the way toward LLMs that are both efficient and trustworthy.

*Xiangling Chen,Yi Mei,Mengjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAMA is a neural neighborhood search method with Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention for Vehicle Routing Problems that outperforms recent neural baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural approaches for VRPs rely on simplistic state representations and naive information fusion, limiting their ability to capture rich structural and semantic context.

Method: Encodes problem instance and evolving solution as distinct modalities using graph neural networks, models intra- and inter-modal interactions through stacked self- and cross-attention layers, and uses gated fusion to integrate multi-modal representations.

Result: Significantly outperforms recent neural baselines across various synthetic and benchmark instances.

Conclusion: Both the multi-modal attention mechanism and gated fusion design are crucial for achieving the observed performance gains in solving VRPs.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural neighborhood search methods have shown potential in tackling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most existing approaches rely on simplistic state representations and fuse heterogeneous information via naive concatenation, limiting their ability to capture rich structural and semantic context. To address these limitations, we propose GAMA, a neural neighborhood search method with Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention model in VRP. GAMA encodes the problem instance and its evolving solution as distinct modalities using graph neural networks, and models their intra- and inter-modal interactions through stacked self- and cross-attention layers. A gated fusion mechanism further integrates the multi-modal representations into a structured state, enabling the policy to make informed and generalizable operator selection decisions. Extensive experiments conducted across various synthetic and benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm GAMA significantly outperforms the recent neural baselines. Further ablation studies confirm that both the multi-modal attention mechanism and the gated fusion design play a key role in achieving the observed performance gains.

### [136] [WaterMod: Modular Token-Rank Partitioning for Probability-Balanced LLM Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07863)
*Shinwoo Park,Hyejin Park,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WaterMod introduces a probability-aware modular watermarking method that maintains text quality while embedding imperceptible provenance marks in LLM outputs, supporting both binary attribution and multi-bit payloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional logit-based watermarks that can exclude high-probability tokens and degrade fluency, while complying with regulations like the EU AI Act requiring machine-verifiable provenance marks for synthetic content.

Method: Uses modular arithmetic to partition vocabulary by token rank mod k, distributing semantically similar tokens across classes. Applies small bias to selected class, with entropy-adaptive gating for zero-bit setting and payload-based selection for multi-bit embedding.

Result: WaterMod achieves strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality across natural language, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis tasks in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings.

Conclusion: The modular approach provides a unified framework for both binary attribution and rich payload embedding, offering robust watermarking without compromising text fluency.

Abstract: Large language models now draft news, legal analyses, and software code with human-level fluency. At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings. This robustness holds across a range of tasks, including natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/WaterMod.

TL;DR: A confidence-aware brain-computer interface framework that uses deep ensembles of speech-oriented convolutional networks with uncertainty quantification and selective classification for reliable EEG-based speech decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop non-invasive brain-computer interfaces that are both accurate and trustworthy for decoding spoken commands from EEG signals, requiring reliable probability estimates and deployment-oriented behavior.

Method: Deep ensembles of compact, speech-oriented convolutional networks coupled with post-hoc calibration and selective classification. Uncertainty is quantified using ensemble-based predictive entropy, top-two margin, and mutual information, with decisions made using an abstain option governed by accuracy-coverage operating points.

Result: The method yields more reliable probability estimates, improved selective performance across operating points, and balanced per-class acceptance compared to widely used baselines, evaluated on a multi-class overt speech dataset using a leakage-safe, block-stratified split.

Conclusion: Confidence-aware neural decoding can provide robust, deployment-oriented behavior for real-world brain-computer interface communication systems.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces that decode spoken commands from electroencephalogram must be both accurate and trustworthy. We present a confidence-aware decoding framework that couples deep ensembles of compact, speech-oriented convolutional networks with post-hoc calibration and selective classification. Uncertainty is quantified using ensemble-based predictive entropy, top-two margin, and mutual information, and decisions are made with an abstain option governed by an accuracy-coverage operating point. The approach is evaluated on a multi-class overt speech dataset using a leakage-safe, block-stratified split that respects temporal contiguity. Compared with widely used baselines, the proposed method yields more reliable probability estimates, improved selective performance across operating points, and balanced per-class acceptance. These results suggest that confidence-aware neural decoding can provide robust, deployment-oriented behavior for real-world brain-computer interface communication systems.

*Ha-Na Jo,Jung-Sun Lee,Eunyeong Ko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EEG-based communication system for aphasia patients detects speech intention despite articulation errors using delta power features and multitask learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aphasia patients struggle with verbal communication due to frequent misarticulations, but current EEG-based BCI systems are not well-adapted for this population's needs.

Method: Recorded EEG during Korean speech tasks, analyzed spectral patterns, and developed soft multitask learning with MMD regularization focusing on delta features to align distributions between correct and misarticulated trials.

Result: Model achieved 58.6% accuracy for correct trials and 45.5% for misarticulated trials, outperforming baseline by over 45% on misarticulated trials.

Conclusion: EEG-based assistive systems can effectively decode speech intentions even during articulation errors, supporting real-world communication for aphasia patients.

Abstract: Aphasia severely limits verbal communication due to impaired language production, often leading to frequent misarticulations during speech attempts. Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors. These results highlight the feasibility of EEG-based assistive systems capable of supporting real-world, imperfect speech conditions in aphasia patients.

*Dengcan Liu,Jiahao Li,Zheren Fu,Yi Tu,Jiajun Li,Zhendong Mao,Yongdong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SparseRM is a lightweight reward model that uses Sparse Autoencoder to extract preference-relevant features from LLM representations, achieving superior performance with less than 1% trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training reliable reward models under limited resources is challenging due to reliance on large-scale preference annotations and high fine-tuning costs of LLMs.

Method: Uses Sparse Autoencoder to decompose LLM representations into interpretable preference-relevant directions, projects representations onto these directions to compute alignment scores, and aggregates scores with a simple reward head.

Result: Achieves superior performance over most mainstream reward models on three preference modeling tasks while using less than 1% of trainable parameters.

Conclusion: SparseRM provides an efficient and interpretable solution for reward modeling that integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are a core component in the post-training of large language models (LLMs), serving as proxies for human preference evaluation and guiding model alignment. However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines, highlighting its potential for efficient alignment.

TL;DR: A novel approach to explain data using textual descriptions generated by large language models, enhanced by influence estimation and CLIP scores, which improves cross-modal classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand data through language for better human interpretability, moving beyond traditional model-focused XAI approaches.

Method: Pipeline using LLMs with external knowledge bases to generate textual descriptions, then applying influence estimation and CLIP scores to select most informative descriptions for cross-modal transfer classification.

Result: Textual descriptions outperformed baseline descriptions in zero-shot settings and boosted performance across nine image classification datasets when combined with image-only training.

Conclusion: The approach provides insights into model decision-making interpretability and demonstrates effective cross-modal knowledge transfer through carefully curated textual descriptions.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been successful in many areas but understanding their behaviors still remains a black-box. Most prior explainable AI (XAI) approaches have focused on interpreting and explaining how models make predictions. In contrast, we would like to understand how data can be explained with deep learning model training and propose a novel approach to understand the data via one of the most common media - language - so that humans can easily understand. Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets. These results are further supported by evaluation using GPT-4o. Through our approach, we may gain insights into the inherent interpretability of the decision-making process of the model.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on all three evaluation metrics for UMLS and YAGO3-10 datasets, demonstrating effectiveness and generalization across six benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DANS-KGC effectively addresses negative sampling limitations through adaptive difficulty assessment and dynamic training, achieving superior performance in knowledge graph completion tasks.

Abstract: Negative sampling (NS) strategies play a crucial role in knowledge graph representation. In order to overcome the limitations of existing negative sampling strategies, such as vulnerability to false negatives, limited generalization, and lack of control over sample hardness, we propose DANS-KGC (Diffusion-based Adaptive Negative Sampling for Knowledge Graph Completion). DANS-KGC comprises three key components: the Difficulty Assessment Module (DAM), the Adaptive Negative Sampling Module (ANS), and the Dynamic Training Mechanism (DTM). DAM evaluates the learning difficulty of entities by integrating semantic and structural features. Based on this assessment, ANS employs a conditional diffusion model with difficulty-aware noise scheduling, leveraging semantic and neighborhood information during the denoising phase to generate negative samples of diverse hardness. DTM further enhances learning by dynamically adjusting the hardness distribution of negative samples throughout training, enabling a curriculum-style progression from easy to hard examples. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of DANS-KGC, with the method achieving state-of-the-art results on all three evaluation metrics for the UMLS and YAGO3-10 datasets.

Motivation: To understand the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying human adaptive reasoning and compare it with artificial intelligence systems like multimodal large language models.

Method: Used card-sorting paradigm combined with electroencephalography (EEG) to analyze neural dynamics, comparing human performance with multimodal large language model.

Result: Humans showed coordinated delta-theta-alpha dynamics: early delta-theta for exploratory monitoring and rule inference, occipital alpha for confirmatory attention stabilization after successful rule identification. LLMs only exhibited short-term feedback-driven adjustments without hierarchical rule abstraction.

Conclusion: Identified neural signatures of human adaptive reasoning and highlighted the need for brain-inspired AI that incorporates oscillatory feedback coordination for true context-sensitive adaptation.

Abstract: Adaptive reasoning enables humans to flexibly adjust inference strategies when environmental rules or contexts change, yet its underlying neural dynamics remain unclear. This study investigated the neurophysiological mechanisms of adaptive reasoning using a card-sorting paradigm combined with electroencephalography and compared human performance with that of a multimodal large language model. Stimulus- and feedback-locked analyses revealed coordinated delta-theta-alpha dynamics: early delta-theta activity reflected exploratory monitoring and rule inference, whereas occipital alpha engagement indicated confirmatory stabilization of attention after successful rule identification. In contrast, the multimodal large language model exhibited only short-term feedback-driven adjustments without hierarchical rule abstraction or genuine adaptive reasoning. These findings identify the neural signatures of human adaptive reasoning and highlight the need for brain-inspired artificial intelligence that incorporates oscillatory feedback coordination for true context-sensitive adaptation.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of deploying diffusion-based EEG decoding under practical clinical constraints, advancing translation of imagined speech brain-computer interfaces for clinical communication support in aphasia patients.

Abstract: A diffusion-based neural decoding framework optimized for real-time imagined speech classification in individuals with aphasia. The system integrates a lightweight conditional diffusion encoder and convolutional classifier trained using subject-specific EEG data acquired from a Korean-language paradigm. A dual-criterion early stopping strategy enabled rapid convergence under limited calibration data, while dropout regularization and grouped temporal convolutions ensured stable generalization. During online operation, continuous EEG streams were processed in two-second sliding windows to generate class probabilities that dynamically modulated visual and auditory feedback according to decoding confidence. Across twenty real-time trials, the framework achieved 65% top-1 and 70% top-2 accuracy, outperforming offline evaluation (50% top-1). These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying diffusion-based EEG decoding under practical clinical constraints, maintaining reliable performance despite environmental variability and minimal preprocessing. The proposed framework advances the translation of imagined speech brain-computer interfaces toward clinical communication support for individuals with severe expressive language impairment.

Conclusion: CBIT framework successfully bridges the gap between research and practical educational deployment, providing scalable and cost-effective isomorphic math problem generation for personalized learning.

Abstract: Personalized mathematics education is growing rapidly, creating a strong demand for large sets of similar practice problems. Yet existing studies on mathematics problem generation have focused on data augmentation for training neural language models rather than on direct educational deployment. To bridge this gap, we define a new task, Isomorphic Math Problem Generation (IMPG), designed to produce structurally consistent variants of source problems. Subsequently, we explored LLM-based frameworks for automatic IMPG through successive refinements, and established Computational Blueprints for Isomorphic Twins (CBIT). With meta-level generation and template-based selective variation, CBIT achieves high mathematical correctness and structural consistency while reducing the cost of generation. Empirical results across refinements demonstrate that CBIT is superior on generation accuracy and cost-effectiveness at scale. Most importantly, CBIT-generated problems exhibited an error rate 17.8% lower than expert-authored items, with deployment to 6,732 learners on a commercial education platform yielding 186,870 interactions.

Method: Proposes information capacity based on the correlation between compression and intelligence, measuring text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Evaluates 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets.

Result: Models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. The metric enables fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. It also incorporates tokenizer efficiency, revealing consistent influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and mixture-of-experts architecture.

Conclusion: Information capacity serves as an effective unified metric for LLM efficiency evaluation, providing fair comparisons across different model architectures while accounting for important factors like tokenizer efficiency that are often neglected in traditional evaluations.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.

TL;DR: Thinker is a hierarchical thinking model that decomposes complex problems into sub-problems with dual representations (natural language and logical functions) for supervised reasoning and efficient knowledge retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches using end-to-end reinforcement learning for LLM retrieval lack supervision over reasoning processes, making it difficult to ensure logical coherence and rigor in problem-solving.

Method: Thinker uses hierarchical decomposition of problems into sub-problems with dual representations, knowledge boundary determination to avoid unnecessary searches, and logical function parameter passing for dependency management.

Result: With only several hundred training samples, Thinker performs competitively with established baselines, and significantly outperforms them when scaled to full training sets across various datasets and model sizes.

Conclusion: Thinker provides a supervisable and verifiable reasoning framework that enhances logical coherence in LLM problem-solving while efficiently leveraging external knowledge bases through multi-turn interactions.

Abstract: Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

TL;DR: TimeFlow is a novel SDE-based flow matching framework for time series generation that addresses computational inefficiency of diffusion models and limitations of ODE-based flow matching by explicitly capturing stochasticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome computational inefficiency of diffusion models and limitations of conventional ODE-based flow matching in capturing stochasticity for time series generation, while leveraging SDE's natural suitability for modeling randomness.

Method: Proposes TimeFlow - an SDE-based flow matching framework with encoder-only architecture, component-wise decomposed velocity field for multi-faceted time series structure, and augmented optimization with additional stochastic term.

Result: Extensive experiments show TimeFlow consistently outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: TimeFlow provides a flexible, general framework for both unconditional and conditional time series generation that effectively captures stochastic dynamics while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Generating high-quality time series data has emerged as a critical research topic due to its broad utility in supporting downstream time series mining tasks. A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency.

TL;DR: VARS is a graph-based ECG diagnosis method that handles diverse signal configurations and improves risk signal detection through versatile graph structures and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ECG deep learning methods lack versatility for diverse signal configurations and have inadequate risk signal detection due to sample imbalances.

Method: Transform ECG signals into versatile graph structures using denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to capture diagnostic features across different lead counts, sampling frequencies, and durations.

Result: VARS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across three ECG datasets, shows substantial improvement in identifying risk signals, and provides interpretability by pinpointing diagnostic waveforms.

Conclusion: VARS is a promising tool for comprehensive cardiac health assessment that addresses key limitations in current ECG analysis methods.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal diagnosis and analysis methods through deep learning, two major hurdles still limit their clinical adoption: the lack of versatility in processing ECG signals with diverse configurations, and the inadequate detection of risk signals due to sample imbalances. Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions. These findings suggest that our VARS will likely emerge as an invaluable tool for comprehensive cardiac health assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of attribution-based explanations which lack granularity needed for insight in fine-grained tasks and model misclassification scenarios.

Method: Uses non-generative counterfactual generation by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions between correctly classified and misclassified samples, with saliency partition module based on Shapley values.

Result: Extensive experiments show superiority in capturing more granular, intuitively meaningful regions compared to existing fine-grained methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses fine-grained feature contributions to misclassification and local feature influence on counterfactual adjustments, providing enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Attribution-based explanation techniques capture key patterns to enhance visual interpretability; however, these patterns often lack the granularity needed for insight in fine-grained tasks, particularly in cases of model misclassification, where explanations may be insufficiently detailed. To address this limitation, we propose a fine-grained counterfactual explanation framework that generates both object-level and part-level interpretability, addressing two fundamental questions: (1) which fine-grained features contribute to model misclassification, and (2) where dominant local features influence counterfactual adjustments. Our approach yields explainable counterfactuals in a non-generative manner by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples. Furthermore, we introduce a saliency partition module grounded in Shapley value contributions, isolating features with region-specific relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in capturing more granular, intuitively meaningful regions, surpassing fine-grained methods.

Conclusion: MSLR advances LLM reasoning and Chain-of-Thought strategies, providing open resources for future legal reasoning research while demonstrating the difficulty of adapting LLMs to complex legal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across specialized domains, motivating research into their application to legal reasoning. However, existing legal benchmarks often conflate factual recall with genuine inference, fragment the reasoning process, and overlook the quality of reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce MSLR, the first Chinese multi-step legal reasoning dataset grounded in real-world judicial decision making. MSLR adopts the IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) to model structured expert reasoning from official legal documents. In addition, we design a scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline that efficiently produces fine-grained step-level reasoning annotations and provides a reusable methodological framework for multi-step reasoning datasets. Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning. Further experiments demonstrate that Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts generated by models autonomously improve reasoning coherence and quality, outperforming human-designed prompts. MSLR contributes to advancing LLM reasoning and Chain-of-Thought strategies and offers open resources for future research.

TL;DR: ST-SAM is a spatial-temporal self-attention model that captures joint spatial-temporal dependencies for traffic forecasting, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic forecasting methods handle spatial and temporal dependencies separately, failing to capture their joint effects, which limits prediction accuracy.

Method: Uses region embedding for time-specific representations and self-attention mechanism to learn joint spatial-temporal dependencies across both nearby and distant regions.

Result: Achieves 15% RMSE improvement, 17% MAPE improvement, and 32x faster training compared to state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: ST-SAM effectively captures complex spatial-temporal interdependencies through self-attention, making it both accurate and efficient for traffic forecasting.

Abstract: We study the problem of traffic forecasting, aiming to predict the inflow and outflow of a region in the subsequent time slot. The problem is complex due to the intricate spatial and temporal interdependence among regions. Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).

TL;DR: This paper proposes VSPO, a novel approach using fine-tuned LLMs to automatically generate competency questions that validate semantic pitfalls in ontology design, outperforming GPT-4.1 with 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual crafting of competency questions for ontology validation is time-consuming and costly, while existing automated approaches fail to detect semantic pitfalls like "Misusing allValuesFrom" that cannot be reliably identified through rule-based methods.

Method: Fine-tuned LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate semantic discrepancies between natural language definitions and ontology axioms, using simulated misalignments created by removing axioms or altering logical operators.

Result: The fine-tuned model demonstrated superior performance over baselines, achieving 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation, and can detect a broader range of modeling errors than existing datasets.

Conclusion: This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge, representing the first study to target semantic pitfall validation in CQ generation using LLMs.

Abstract: Competency Questions (CQs) play a crucial role in validating ontology design. While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as "Misusing allValuesFrom". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to target semantic pitfall validation in CQ generation using LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN studies focus on simple single-relation graphs, lacking sufficient discussion on logical rule expression in knowledge graphs. Enhancing GNNs' logical expressive power remains a key challenge.

Method: Proposed Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN) that aggregates node-neighbor embeddings on reasoning paths. Analyzed existing GNN methods' limitations and theoretically investigated PN-GNN's logical expressive power.

Result: PN-GNN has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN, with (k+1)-hop expressiveness superior to k-hop. Experiments on 6 synthetic and 2 real-world datasets confirm enhanced logical rule expression without compromising generalization.

Conclusion: PN-GNN successfully enhances GNNs' logical expressive power for knowledge graph reasoning, achieving competitive performance while maintaining generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively model structural information of graphs, making them widely used in knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel MVMLFS method that combines LLM semantic reasoning with GNN structural modeling to jointly leverage statistical and semantic information for feature selection in multi-view multi-label learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVMLFS methods focus mainly on statistical information but neglect semantic information, which is crucial for understanding complex relationships in heterogeneous multi-view data.

Method: Three components: (1) LLM as evaluation agent for semantic relevance assessment, (2) Two-level semantic-aware heterogeneous graph (semantic graph + statistical graph), (3) Lightweight GAT for learning feature saliency scores.

Result: Superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines on multiple benchmark datasets, effective on small-scale datasets, demonstrating robustness, flexibility and generalization ability.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-GNN integration effectively combines semantic and statistical information for MVMLFS, providing a robust and flexible solution that generalizes well across different dataset scales.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-label feature selection aims to identify informative features from heterogeneous views, where each sample is associated with multiple interdependent labels. This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A perturbation framework reveals LLMs' mathematical reasoning limitations - they perform worse with numerical perturbations and may rely on pattern matching rather than true logical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs truly understand mathematics or just perform pattern matching, by testing their robustness against various perturbations.

Method: Proposed a perturbation framework injecting semantically irrelevant sentences and gradually increasing perturbation intensity, plus testing with missing core questioning instructions.

Result: LLMs show stability with non-numerical perturbations but significant performance drops (up to 51.55%) with numerical perturbations. Even advanced models drop 3-10%. Models maintain 20-40% accuracy without core instructions, suggesting pattern matching.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in mathematical reasoning, being sensitive to numerical perturbations and potentially relying on memory templates rather than true logical reasoning.

Abstract: LLMs have made significant progress in the field of mathematical reasoning, but whether they have true the mathematical understanding ability is still controversial. To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning. In general, our work reveals the shortcomings and limitations of current LLMs in their reasoning capabilities, which is of great significance for the further development of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address logical inconsistencies and lack of domain knowledge grounding in LLMs for biomolecular reasoning, where existing approaches fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies and deviate from biological facts.

Method: Integrates LLMs with knowledge graphs via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning to construct mechanistic chains, followed by supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning for improved factual grounding and reasoning reliability.

Result: Outperforms larger closed-source models on multi-hop tasks requiring structured biological knowledge traversal, achieving state-of-the-art performance as reasoning depth increases.

Conclusion: Combining structured knowledge with advanced reasoning strategies enables reliable and interpretable biomolecular reasoning, with clear advantages for complex multi-step reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Understanding complex biomolecular mechanisms requires multi-step reasoning across molecular interactions, signaling cascades, and metabolic pathways. While large language models(LLMs) show promise in such tasks, their application to biomolecular problems is hindered by logical inconsistencies and the lack of grounding in domain knowledge. Existing approaches often exacerbate these issues: reasoning steps may deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains. The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge with advanced reasoning strategies for reliable and interpretable biomolecular reasoning.

*JV Roig*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KAMI v0.1 is an enterprise-focused benchmark that addresses LLM training data contamination and evaluates agentic capabilities like multi-step tool use, showing traditional benchmarks poorly predict practical agentic performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM benchmarks suffer from training data contamination and fail to measure agentic capabilities needed for real-world enterprise deployment scenarios.

Method: Developed Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1 benchmark, processing 170,000 LLM test items over 5.5 billion tokens across 35 model configurations to evaluate contamination resistance and agentic capabilities.

Result: Traditional benchmark rankings poorly predict practical agentic performance; newer generation models don't always outperform older variants on enterprise tasks, contradicting traditional benchmark trends.

Conclusion: KAMI provides critical insights on cost-performance tradeoffs, model-specific behavioral patterns, and reasoning capabilities' impact on token efficiency for enterprise deployment decisions.

Abstract: Enterprise adoption of agentic AI systems requires reliable evaluation methods that reflect real-world deployment scenarios. Traditional LLM benchmarks suffer from training data contamination and fail to measure agentic capabilities such as multi-step tool use and decision-making under uncertainty. We present the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1, an enterprise-focused benchmark that addresses both contamination resistance and agentic evaluation. Through 170,000 LLM test items processing over 5.5 billion tokens across 35 model configurations, we demonstrate that traditional benchmark rankings poorly predict practical agentic performance. Notably, newer generation models like Llama 4 or Qwen 3 do not always outperform their older generation variants on enterprise-relevant tasks, contradicting traditional benchmark trends. We also present insights on cost-performance tradeoffs, model-specific behavioral patterns, and the impact of reasoning capabilities on token efficiency -- findings critical for enterprises making deployment decisions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging using psychological theories, achieving 88.91% pass rate on DebugBench with 5.36s average inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack in-depth exploration of System 2 reasoning, and there's a need to balance reasoning complexity with computational efficiency for code debugging tasks.

Method: Scaffold Reasoning framework with three streams: Scaffold Stream (constructs reference code), Analytic Stream (analyzes buggy code), and Integration Stream (combines both streams).

Result: Achieved 88.91% pass rate on DebugBench with average inference time of 5.36 seconds per problem, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs.

Conclusion: The framework aligns with human cognitive processes and demonstrates advantages across different problem difficulties and bug types, providing insights into optimal cognitive pathways for reasoning.

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated sophisticated problem-solving capabilities on various benchmarks through advanced reasoning algorithms. However, the key research question of identifying reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency remains unsolved. Recent research has increasingly drawn upon psychological theories to explore strategies for optimizing cognitive pathways. The LLM's final outputs and intermediate steps are regarded as System 1 and System 2, respectively. However, an in-depth exploration of the System 2 reasoning is still lacking. Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream. Our framework achieves an 88.91% pass rate and an average inference time of 5.36 seconds per-problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Further analyses elucidate the advantages and limitations of various cognitive pathways across varying problem difficulties and bug types. Our findings also corroborate the alignment of the proposed Scaffold Reasoning framework with human cognitive processes.

*Zhishen Sun,Guang Dai,Haishan Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSCR is an automated adversarial attack method that uses multi-source candidate replacement to test LLM robustness in mathematical reasoning, showing significant accuracy drops from minor perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show human-level performance in mathematical reasoning but their robustness under minor input perturbations lacks systematic investigation, with existing methods having scalability, semantic preservation, and cost limitations.

Method: MSCR combines cosine similarity in LLM embeddings, WordNet dictionary, and masked language model predictions to generate semantically similar word candidates, which are filtered and substituted one by one for adversarial attacks.

Result: Single-word perturbations significantly reduce accuracy (max drops: 49.89% on GSM8K, 35.40% on MATH500) while preserving semantic consistency, and increase response length leading to redundant reasoning and higher computational costs.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant robustness deficiencies and efficiency bottlenecks in mathematical reasoning tasks, as minor perturbations cause substantial performance degradation and computational inefficiency.

Abstract: LLMs demonstrate performance comparable to human abilities in complex tasks such as mathematical reasoning, but their robustness in mathematical reasoning under minor input perturbations still lacks systematic investigation. Existing methods generally suffer from limited scalability, weak semantic preservation, and high costs. Therefore, we propose MSCR, an automated adversarial attack method based on multi-source candidate replacement. By combining three information sources including cosine similarity in the embedding space of LLMs, the WordNet dictionary, and contextual predictions from a masked language model, we generate for each word in the input question a set of semantically similar candidates, which are then filtered and substituted one by one to carry out the attack. We conduct large-scale experiments on LLMs using the GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks. The results show that even a slight perturbation involving only a single word can significantly reduce the accuracy of all models, with the maximum drop reaching 49.89% on GSM8K and 35.40% on MATH500, while preserving the high semantic consistency of the perturbed questions. Further analysis reveals that perturbations not only lead to incorrect outputs but also substantially increase the average response length, which results in more redundant reasoning paths and higher computational resource consumption. These findings highlight the robustness deficiencies and efficiency bottlenecks of current LLMs in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a clustering-based approach using extended fuzzy clustering and Particle Swarm Optimization to detect anomalies in multivariate time series by analyzing amplitude and shape patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is challenging due to the need to consider temporal and variable relationships simultaneously, with applications in science and engineering.

Method: Uses sliding window to generate multivariate subsequences, applies extended fuzzy clustering to reveal structure, employs reconstruction criterion with cluster centers, and uses Particle Swarm Optimization for optimization.

Result: Experimental studies on synthetic and real-world datasets show the method can effectively detect anomalies in multivariate time series.

Conclusion: The framework successfully detects anomalies in multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various domains like healthcare, weather analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.

Abstract: Multivariate time series data come as a collection of time series describing different aspects of a certain temporal phenomenon. Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To translate supervisory expectations from insurance regulations (Solvency II, SR 11-7, EIOPA, NAIC, IAIS) into measurable controls for reliable AI in reinsurance, addressing informational frictions in risk transfer.

Method: Five-pillar architecture (governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, regulatory alignment) implemented through RAIRAB benchmark evaluating governance-embedded LLMs across six task families.

Result: Retrieval-grounded configurations achieved 0.90 grounding accuracy, reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by ~40%, and nearly doubled transparency compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable, lowering informational frictions in reinsurance operations.

Abstract: This paper develops a prudential framework for assessing the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in reinsurance. A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency. These mechanisms lower informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation, showing that existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pearl's Causal Hierarchy satisfiability is computationally intractable in most classical settings, motivating the search for tractable cases through parameterized complexity.

Method: Uses parameterized complexity approach with parameters like primal treewidth and number of variables, departing from dynamic programming to exploit structural characterizations of causal models.

Result: Provides first fixed-parameter and XP-algorithms for satisfiability in key probabilistic and counterfactual fragments, with matching hardness results establishing tractability boundaries.

Conclusion: Establishes new algorithmic toolkit for causal reasoning by identifying structural parameters that enable tractable satisfiability checking in Pearl's Causal Hierarchy.

Abstract: Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) is a central framework for reasoning about probabilistic, interventional, and counterfactual statements, yet the satisfiability problem for PCH formulas is computationally intractable in almost all classical settings. We revisit this challenge through the lens of parameterized complexity and identify the first gateways to tractability. Our results include fixed-parameter and XP-algorithms for satisfiability in key probabilistic and counterfactual fragments, using parameters such as primal treewidth and the number of variables, together with matching hardness results that map the limits of tractability. Technically, we depart from the dynamic programming paradigm typically employed for treewidth-based algorithms and instead exploit structural characterizations of well-formed causal models, providing a new algorithmic toolkit for causal reasoning.

TL;DR: Feature reduction using XAI techniques (SHAP, Grad-CAM, LIME) improves generalization and maintains high classification performance for injection-molded parts quality control, while slightly increasing inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models lack interpretability and industrial machines often have limited sensor technology, making data acquisition challenging. XAI can provide insights into model decisions and identify relevant features.

Method: Applied SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in an LSTM model trained on real production data. Reduced original 19 input features to 9 and 6 features to evaluate trade-offs between accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability.

Result: Feature reduction improved generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with a small increase in inference speed.

Conclusion: This approach enhances feasibility of AI-driven quality control for industrial settings with limited sensor capabilities and enables more efficient and interpretable machine learning applications in manufacturing.

Abstract: Machine learning is an essential tool for optimizing industrial quality control processes. However, the complexity of machine learning models often limits their practical applicability due to a lack of interpretability. Additionally, many industrial machines lack comprehensive sensor technology, making data acquisition incomplete and challenging. Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers a solution by providing insights into model decision-making and identifying the most relevant features for classification. In this paper, we investigate the impact of feature reduction using XAI techniques on the quality classification of injection-molded parts. We apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data. By reducing the original 19 input features to 9 and 6, we evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability. Our results show that reducing features can improve generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with an small increase in inference speed. This approach enhances the feasibility of AI-driven quality control, particularly for industrial settings with limited sensor capabilities, and paves the way for more efficient and interpretable machine learning applications in manufacturing.

Motivation: Data acquisition for machine learning in industrial processes is time-consuming and costly, while synthetic data offers a solution to augment insufficient datasets.

Result: Inclusion of synthetic data improves model's ability to handle different scenarios, potentially reducing manual labor, machine use, and material waste.

Conclusion: Synthetic data provides a valuable alternative for situations where extensive data collection is impractical, contributing to more efficient manufacturing processes.

Abstract: Machine learning has significant potential for optimizing various industrial processes. However, data acquisition remains a major challenge as it is both time-consuming and costly. Synthetic data offers a promising solution to augment insufficient data sets and improve the robustness of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of incorporating synthetic data into the training process of the injection molding process using an existing Long Short-Term Memory architecture. Our approach is to generate synthetic data by simulating production cycles and incorporating them into the training data set. Through iterative experimentation with different proportions of synthetic data, we attempt to find an optimal balance that maximizes the benefits of synthetic data while preserving the authenticity and relevance of real data. Our results suggest that the inclusion of synthetic data improves the model's ability to handle different scenarios, with potential practical industrial applications to reduce manual labor, machine use, and material waste. This approach provides a valuable alternative for situations where extensive data collection and maintenance has been impractical or costly and thus could contribute to more efficient manufacturing processes in the future.

TL;DR: SpeechCARE is a multimodal speech processing pipeline that uses pretrained transformer models to detect Alzheimer's disease and related dementias through acoustic, linguistic, and demographic analysis, achieving strong performance with AUC=0.88 for classification and minimal bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over 50% of individuals with cognitive decline remain undiagnosed, and conventional speech-processing methods show limited performance and generalizability for early ADRD detection.

Method: Uses pretrained multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformers with dynamic fusion architecture inspired by Mixture of Experts, incorporating robust preprocessing (automatic transcription, LLM-based anomaly detection) and SHAP-based explainability.

Result: Achieved AUC=0.88 and F1=0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals; AUC=0.90 and F1=0.62 for MCI detection; minimal bias except for adults over 80.

Conclusion: SpeechCARE shows promise for early ADRD detection and will be deployed in real-world care settings with EHR integration for underrepresented populations.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect one in five adults over 60, yet more than half of individuals with cognitive decline remain undiagnosed. Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss. Future work includes deployment in real-world care settings (e.g., VNS Health, Columbia ADRC) and EHR-integrated explainability for underrepresented populations in New York City.

Conclusion: Principled data curation and robust adaptation can rival large-scale training, enabling compact yet capable multimodal reasoning agents.

Abstract: Visual grounding is the task of localising image regions from natural language queries and is critical for reasoning capable Graphical User Interface agents. Many existing methods rely on massive, noisy synthetic datasets.This work introduces an efficient training pipeline that combines model-based data filtering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. From 4.8M synthetic examples, 12K clean and diverse instances are curated by first identifying challenging cases, removing misaligned and then selecting a diverse set of multimodal instances. On this data, a 3B-parameter Vision-Language Model is trained under three regimes: supervised fine-tuning, chain-of-thought- augmented fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. Models trained with the filtered data and lightweight training strategies match or surpass larger baselines on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and AndroidControl. These results demonstrate that principled data curation and robust adaptation can rival large-scale training, enabling compact yet capable multimodal reasoning agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in machine learning by preventing models from learning from user data without consent, overcoming limitations of existing heuristic methods.

Method: Optimization-based approach using projected gradient ascent to systematically maximize Bayes error for constructing unlearnable examples.

Result: Method provably increases Bayes error and remains effective when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean samples across multiple datasets and model architectures.

Conclusion: The approach successfully restricts data learnability with formal guarantees, offering a practical solution for privacy protection in machine learning.

Abstract: The recent success of machine learning models, especially large-scale classifiers and language models, relies heavily on training with massive data. These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice.

Abstract: Structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data stores patient information in relational tables and plays a central role in clinical decision-making. Recent advances have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to process such data, showing promise across various clinical tasks.However, the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks and clearly defined tasks makes it difficult to systematically assess and compare LLM performance on structured EHR data.To address these evaluation challenges, we introduce EHRStruct, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on structured EHR tasks.EHRStruct defines 11 representative tasks spanning diverse clinical needs and includes 2,200 task-specific evaluation samples derived from two widely used EHR datasets.We use EHRStruct to evaluate 20 advanced and representative LLMs, covering both general and medical models.We further analyze key factors influencing model performance, including input formats, few-shot generalisation, and finetuning strategies, and compare results with 11 state-of-the-art LLM-based enhancement methods for structured data reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAC introduces a geometric action control method that preserves spherical distribution benefits while simplifying computation, achieving better performance than Gaussian policies in continuous control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian policies have fundamental mismatch with bounded action spaces requiring ad-hoc squashing functions, while vMF distributions are theoretically better but computationally impractical.

Method: GAC decomposes action generation into direction vector and learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise with O(d) complexity.

Result: GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and best results on 4 out of 6 tasks.

Conclusion: Robust and efficient continuous control requires principled respect for action space geometry rather than complex distributions, with spherical normalization and adaptive concentration control being essential.

Abstract: Gaussian policies have dominated continuous control in deep reinforcement learning (RL), yet they suffer from a fundamental mismatch: their unbounded support requires ad-hoc squashing functions that distort the geometry of bounded action spaces. While von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions offer a theoretically grounded alternative on the sphere, their reliance on Bessel functions and rejection sampling hinders practical adoption. We propose \textbf{Geometric Action Control (GAC)}, a novel action generation paradigm that preserves the geometric benefits of spherical distributions while \textit{simplifying computation}. GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and a learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. This design reduces parameter count from \(2d\) to \(d+1\), and avoids the \(O(dk)\) complexity of vMF rejection sampling, achieving simple \(O(d)\) operations. Empirically, GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6\% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and the best results on 4 out of 6 tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that both \textbf{spherical normalization} and \textbf{adaptive concentration control} are essential to GAC's success. These findings suggest that robust and efficient continuous control does not require complex distributions, but a principled respect for the geometry of action spaces. Code and pretrained models are available in supplementary materials.

### [176] [Towards Outcome-Oriented, Task-Agnostic Evaluation of AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08242)
*Waseem AlShikh,Muayad Sayed Ali,Brian Kennedy,Dmytro Mozolevskyi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes 11 outcome-based metrics for evaluating AI agents beyond infrastructure metrics, tested across 4 architectures and 5 domains, showing Hybrid Agents perform best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agent evaluation focuses on infrastructure metrics (latency, throughput) which don't capture decision quality, autonomy, or business value.

Method: Large-scale simulated experiment with 4 agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across 5 domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, Customer Service) using 11 proposed metrics.

Result: Hybrid Agent performed best across most metrics with 88.8% Goal Completion Rate and highest ROI, revealing significant performance trade-offs between architectures.

Conclusion: Provides standardized methodology for holistic AI agent evaluation, enabling better development, deployment, and governance.

Abstract: As AI agents proliferate across industries and applications, evaluating their performance based solely on infrastructural metrics such as latency, time-to-first-token, or token throughput is proving insufficient. These metrics fail to capture the quality of an agent's decisions, its operational autonomy, or its ultimate business value. This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI). This work provides a robust, standardized methodology for the holistic evaluation of AI agents, paving the way for more effective development, deployment, and governance.

### [177] [Where and What Matters: Sensitivity-Aware Task Vectors for Many-Shot Multimodal In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08246)
*Ziyu Ma,Chenhui Gou,Yiming Hu,Yong Wang,Xiangxiang Chu,Bohan Zhuang,Jianfei Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STV is a sensitivity-aware task vector insertion framework that determines where and what to insert for many-shot in-context learning in Large Multimodal Models, improving over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Multimodal Models struggle with many-shot in-context learning due to limited context length and high inference costs, while existing task-vector methods fail to properly determine insertion locations and values.

Method: STV identifies sensitive locations using consistent structural patterns in activation deltas, constructs pre-clustered activation banks for each location, and uses reinforcement learning to select optimal insertion values.

Result: STV demonstrates effectiveness across various multimodal models (Qwen-VL, Idefics-2) and tasks (VizWiz, OK-VQA), showing consistent improvements over previous task-vector methods with strong generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed STV framework successfully addresses the challenges of many-shot in-context learning in Large Multimodal Models by systematically determining where and what to insert task vectors.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promising in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, but scaling to many-shot settings remains difficult due to limited context length and high inference cost. To address these challenges, task-vector-based methods have been explored by inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into model activations. However, existing task-vector-based methods either overlook the importance of where to insert task vectors or struggle to determine suitable values for each location. To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert. We evaluate STV across a range of multimodal models (e.g., Qwen-VL, Idefics-2) and tasks (e.g., VizWiz, OK-VQA), demonstrating its effectiveness and showing consistent improvements over previous task-vector-based methods with strong generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation that serves as natural language interface to Labeled Property Graph databases, addressing the gap in leveraging Cypher and LPG databases for GraphRAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GraphRAG efforts focus mainly on RDF knowledge graphs using triple representations and SPARQL queries, while the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph databases as scalable reasoning engines in GraphRAG pipelines remains underexplored.

Method: A modular LLM agentic system with automated Cypher query generation and execution using Memgraph as backend, featuring iterative content-aware correction and normalization with aggregated feedback loop for semantic and syntactic refinement.

Result: Evaluated on CypherBench graph dataset across general domains and demonstrated on property graph derived from IFC data representing building digital twin, showing the approach can bridge AI with real-world applications at scale.

Conclusion: The proposed Multi-Agent GraphRAG system effectively leverages Cypher and LPG databases for GraphRAG, enabling industrial digital automation use cases through scalable natural language interfaces to structured graph data.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods commonly draw information from unstructured documents, the emerging paradigm of GraphRAG aims to leverage structured data such as knowledge graphs. Most existing GraphRAG efforts focus on Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge graphs, relying on triple representations and SPARQL queries. However, the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph (LPG) databases to serve as scalable and effective reasoning engines within GraphRAG pipelines remains underexplored in current research literature. To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation serving as a natural language interface to LPG-based graph data. Our proof-of-concept system features an LLM-based workflow for automated Cypher queries generation and execution, using Memgraph as the graph database backend. Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries. We evaluate our system on the CypherBench graph dataset covering several general domains with diverse types of queries. In addition, we demonstrate performance of the proposed workflow on a property graph derived from the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) data, representing a digital twin of a building. This highlights how such an approach can bridge AI with real-world applications at scale, enabling industrial digital automation use cases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiagramIR: An automatic evaluation pipeline for geometric figures generated by LLMs using intermediate representations of LaTeX TikZ code, achieving higher human agreement than LLM-as-a-Judge and enabling cost-effective deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for learning but most tools are text-only, limiting usefulness in visualization-dependent domains like mathematics. Current methods face scalability bottlenecks in evaluating generated diagrams.

Method: Proposed DiagramIR pipeline using intermediate representations (IRs) of LaTeX TikZ code to automatically evaluate geometric figures generated by LLMs.

Result: DiagramIR achieves higher agreement with human raters compared to LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. Enables smaller models (GPT-4.1-Mini) to perform comparably to larger models (GPT-5) at 10x lower inference cost.

Conclusion: DiagramIR provides scalable evaluation for educational figures, making LLM-based educational technologies more accessible and cost-effective for deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as tools for learning; however, most tools remain text-only, limiting their usefulness for domains where visualizations are essential, such as mathematics. Recent work shows that LLMs are capable of generating code that compiles to educational figures, but a major bottleneck remains: scalable evaluation of these diagrams. We address this by proposing DiagramIR: an automatic and scalable evaluation pipeline for geometric figures. Our method relies on intermediate representations (IRs) of LaTeX TikZ code. We compare our pipeline to other evaluation baselines such as LLM-as-a-Judge, showing that our approach has higher agreement with human raters. This evaluation approach also enables smaller models like GPT-4.1-Mini to perform comparably to larger models such as GPT-5 at a 10x lower inference cost, which is important for deploying accessible and scalable education technologies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Spark is a shared agentic memory architecture that enables AI coding agents to collectively learn and share knowledge, improving code quality and matching larger models' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional developer knowledge sharing platforms are declining while AI agents lack shared learning repositories, creating a gap in collective intelligence for coding agents.

Method: Introduces Spark - a shared agentic memory architecture where AI coding agents contribute to and draw from a persistent experiential memory for collective continual learning.

Result: Spark improved code quality across various model sizes, enabling a 30B parameter model to match state-of-the-art larger models. Recommendations achieved 98.2% helpfulness in top qualitative bands.

Conclusion: Spark successfully emulates human developer communities' collective intelligence, providing an effective shared memory system for AI coding agents to achieve better performance through knowledge sharing.

Abstract: The transition from human-centric to agent-centric software development practices is disrupting existing knowledge sharing environments for software developers. Traditional peer-to-peer repositories and developer communities for shared technical knowledge and best practice have witnessed dramatic drops in participation in a short period of time. At the same time, agentic functional equivalents are yet to emerge leaving AI agents, which already generate a significant proportion of all new software code produced, without access to repositories of valuable shared learning.
  In this paper, we introduce Spark, a novel shared agentic memory architecture which is designed to emulate the collective intelligence and know-how of human developer communities. Spark enables AI coding agents to both contribute to and draw from a persistent and continuously evolving experiential memory. Agents operating in the same general problem space use the Spark shared memory as a repository of new knowledge to achieve collective continual learning. We evaluate Spark as a coach for AI coding agents performing software development tasks. We demonstrate that recommendations made by Spark improve the quality of code generated by generic code generation models at varying sizes and capability tiers. Boosted by Spark, a small open-weights model with 30 billion parameters was able to match the code quality afforded by a much larger state-of-the-art model. Separately, we measure the intrinsic quality of recommendations generated by Spark against a wide range of criteria inspired by software development best practice, and achieve helpfulness levels of up to 98.2% in the top two (out of five) qualitative helpfulness bands.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate time-consuming manual data analysis and establish automated AI-based analysis in data-driven environments.

Method: Combines Python Flask backend with React frontend, uses Firebase Cloud Storage, employs ML algorithms for data cleaning (imputation, outlier detection), feature selection (4 algorithms), and intelligent visualization selection.

Result: Successfully processed datasets up to 100,000 rows in real-time, scaled to handle multiple users simultaneously, and maintained high-quality visual outputs with reduced manual inputs.

Conclusion: The cloud-based platform significantly reduces manual effort in data analysis while delivering high-quality visualizations and user experiences.

Abstract: An AI-powered data visualization platform that automates the entire data analysis process, from uploading a dataset to generating an interactive visualization. Advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to clean and preprocess the data, analyse its features, and automatically select appropriate visualizations. The system establishes the process of automating AI-based analysis and visualization from the context of data-driven environments, and eliminates the challenge of time-consuming manual data analysis. The combination of a Python Flask backend to access the dataset, paired with a React frontend, provides a robust platform that automatically interacts with Firebase Cloud Storage for numerous data processing and data analysis solutions and real-time sources. Key contributions include automatic and intelligent data cleaning, with imputation for missing values, and detection of outliers, via analysis of the data set. AI solutions to intelligently select features, using four different algorithms, and intelligent title generation and visualization are determined by the attributes of the dataset. These contributions were evaluated using two separate datasets to assess the platform's performance. In the process evaluation, the initial analysis was performed in real-time on datasets as large as 100000 rows, while the cloud-based demand platform scales to meet requests from multiple users and processes them simultaneously. In conclusion, the cloud-based data visualization application allowed for a significant reduction of manual inputs to the data analysis process while maintaining a high quality, impactful visual outputs, and user experiences

*Giorgio Piras,Raffaele Mura,Fabio Brau,Luca Oneto,Fabio Roli,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Self-Organizing Maps to extract multiple refusal directions from language models, showing this multi-direction approach outperforms single-direction methods and jailbreak algorithms in suppressing refusal behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction, but evidence suggests concepts in LLMs are encoded as low-dimensional manifolds rather than single directions. The authors aim to capture this multi-faceted nature of refusal.

Method: Use Self-Organizing Maps trained on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons, then subtract the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron to derive multiple refusal directions.

Result: Ablating multiple directions outperforms single-direction baseline and specialized jailbreak algorithms, effectively suppressing refusal behavior in models.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that refusal is encoded as a manifold rather than a single direction, with mechanistic implications for understanding safety alignment in language models.

Abstract: Refusal refers to the functional behavior enabling safety-aligned language models to reject harmful or unethical prompts. Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal. Finally, we conclude by analyzing the mechanistic implications of our approach.

TL;DR: FaithEval framework for quantifying faithfulness in LLM reasoning, and FaithAct framework for enforcing evidential grounding at each reasoning step to improve perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address persistent unfaithfulness in LLMs where models produce plausible but ungrounded reasoning chains that diverge from perceptual evidence or final conclusions.

Method: Introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating visual support for claimed objects, and propose FaithAct framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step.

Result: FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines across multiple reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but leads to more stable reasoning trajectories, establishing a unified framework for evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Unfaithfulness remains a persistent challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often produce plausible yet ungrounded reasoning chains that diverge from perceptual evidence or final conclusions. We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can be patched like software using lightweight prefix patches to address safety vulnerabilities without full model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Major LLM releases are costly and infrequent, leaving deployed models with known safety gaps that need rapid remediation.

Method: Prepend a compact, learnable prefix (0.003% additional parameters) to existing models to steer behavior toward safer reference models.

Result: Patches achieve safety improvements comparable to next-generation safety-aligned models across toxicity mitigation, bias reduction, and harmfulness refusal while preserving fluency.

Conclusion: LLM patching provides a practical mechanism for distributing scalable, efficient, and composable safety updates between major releases.

Abstract: We propose patching for large language models (LLMs) like software versions, a lightweight and modular approach for addressing safety vulnerabilities. While vendors release improved LLM versions, major releases are costly, infrequent, and difficult to tailor to customer needs, leaving released models with known safety gaps. Unlike full-model fine-tuning or major version updates, our method enables rapid remediation by prepending a compact, learnable prefix to an existing model. This "patch" introduces only 0.003% additional parameters, yet reliably steers model behavior toward that of a safer reference model. Across three critical domains (toxicity mitigation, bias reduction, and harmfulness refusal) policy patches achieve safety improvements comparable to next-generation safety-aligned models while preserving fluency. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can be "patched" much like software, offering vendors and practitioners a practical mechanism for distributing scalable, efficient, and composable safety updates between major model releases.

TL;DR: LLMs show partial alignment with human judgments of mathematical interestingness but fail to fully capture human reasoning patterns and judgment distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how well AI systems like LLMs align with human judgments of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, as LLMs increasingly participate in mathematics with humans for research and education.

Method: Conducted two empirical studies comparing human and LLM assessments of mathematical interestingness and difficulty across two groups: crowdsourcing platform participants and International Math Olympiad competitors.

Result: LLMs broadly agree with human notions of interestingness but don't capture the full distribution of human judgments. They show weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have both promises and limitations in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI partnerships, showing partial alignment but incomplete understanding of human reasoning.

Abstract: The evolution of mathematics has been guided in part by interestingness. From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.

Motivation: To create a decoding method with high accuracy, high noise robustness, low latency and low energy usage for spiking neural networks.

Method: Combines spiking neural networks (SNNs) with hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to create a hybrid SNN-HDC decoding model.

Result: Achieved better classification accuracy, lower latency and 1.24x-3.67x energy reduction on DvsGesture dataset and 1.38x-2.27x on SL-Animals-DVS dataset. Can identify 100% of unknown class samples.

Conclusion: SNN-HDC represents a compelling alternative to both rate and latency decoding methods due to its numerous benefits.

Abstract: This work presents a novel spiking neural network (SNN) decoding method, combining SNNs with Hyperdimensional computing (HDC). The goal is to create a decoding method with high accuracy, high noise robustness, low latency and low energy usage. Compared to analogous architectures decoded with existing approaches, the presented SNN-HDC model attains generally better classification accuracy, lower classification latency and lower estimated energy consumption on multiple test cases from literature. The SNN-HDC achieved estimated energy consumption reductions ranging from 1.24x to 3.67x on the DvsGesture dataset and from 1.38x to 2.27x on the SL-Animals-DVS dataset. The presented decoding method can also efficiently identify unknown classes it has not been trained on. In the DvsGesture dataset the SNN-HDC model can identify 100% of samples from an unseen/untrained class. Given the numerous benefits shown and discussed in this paper, this decoding method represents a very compelling alternative to both rate and latency decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability limitations in neurosymbolic AI systems while maintaining accuracy, interpretability, and generalization capabilities.

Method: Parameterizes derivation steps with neural networks and establishes formal mapping between resolution process and Markov Decision Processes for dynamic programming and reinforcement learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art neurosymbolic systems on standard benchmarks and knowledge graph reasoning tasks, achieving scalability to larger and more complex settings.

Conclusion: DPrL successfully addresses scalability challenges in neurosymbolic AI while maintaining desirable properties like accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) AI aims to combine the strengths of neural architectures and symbolic reasoning to improve the accuracy, interpretability, and generalization capability of AI models. While logic inference on top of subsymbolic modules has been shown to effectively guarantee these properties, this often comes at the cost of reduced scalability, which can severely limit the usability of NeSy models. This paper introduces DeepProofLog (DPrL), a novel NeSy system based on stochastic logic programs, which addresses the scalability limitations of previous methods. DPrL parameterizes all derivation steps with neural networks, allowing efficient neural guidance over the proving system. Additionally, we establish a formal mapping between the resolution process of our deep stochastic logic programs and Markov Decision Processes, enabling the application of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques for efficient inference and learning. This theoretical connection improves scalability for complex proof spaces and large knowledge bases.

Motivation: The shift from purely visual video generation to interactive virtual environments that maintain physical plausibility and support agent-environment interactions, pointing toward video foundation models as implicit world models.

Method: Systematic survey conceptualizing modern video foundation models as two core components: implicit world model (encoding physical laws, interaction dynamics, agent behavior) and video renderer (transforming latent simulation into realistic visual observations).

Result: Traces progression through four generations of video generation, culminating in world models with intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and multi-scale planning capabilities, with applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and gaming.

Conclusion: Discusses open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, emphasizing the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems, with ongoing maintenance of related works.

Abstract: The landscape of video generation is shifting, from a focus on generating visually appealing clips to building virtual environments that support interaction and maintain physical plausibility. These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a "window" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes movable antenna architecture with hierarchical sub-connected hybrid beamforming to suppress beam squint in wideband near-field arrays without needing complex TTD circuits, achieving up to 140% sum rate improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frequency-dependent array responses in wideband near-field arrays cause beam squint that degrades multi-user performance, while existing TTD solutions require large delay ranges and intricate calibration limiting scalability.

Method: Hierarchical sub-connected hybrid beamforming with movable antennas grouped into tiles, where only tile centers are repositioned to provide geometric degrees of freedom that emulate TTD-like broadband focusing while keeping complexity low.

Result: Simulations show robust squint suppression and consistent gains over fixed-layout arrays, achieving up to 5% higher sum rate with maximum improvement exceeding 140% across wideband near-field scenarios.

Conclusion: Reconfiguring tile locations in movable antenna architecture enables effective broadband focusing and enhances multi-user performance without the complexity of TTD networks.

Abstract: In wideband near-field arrays, frequency-dependent array responses cause wavefronts at different frequencies to deviate from that at the center frequency, producing beam squint and degrading multi-user performance. True-time-delay (TTD) circuits can realign the frequency dependence but require large delay ranges and intricate calibration, limiting scalability. Another line of work explores one- and two-dimensional array geometries, including linear, circular, and concentric circular, that exhibit distinct broadband behaviors such as different beam-squint sensitivities and focusing characteristics. These observations motivate adapting the array layout to enable wideband-friendly focusing and enhance multi-user performance without TTD networks. We propose a movable antenna (MA) aided architecture based on hierarchical sub-connected hybrid beamforming (HSC-HBF) in which antennas are grouped into tiles and only the tile centers are repositioned, providing slow geometric degrees of freedom that emulate TTD-like broadband focusing while keeping hardware and optimization complexity low. We show that the steering vector is inherently frequency dependent and that reconfiguring tile locations improves broadband focusing. Simulations across wideband near-field scenarios demonstrate robust squint suppression and consistent gains over fixed-layout arrays, achieving up to 5\% higher sum rate, with the maximum improvement exceeding 140\%.

*Ehsan Alamdari,Rouhollah Amiri*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A unified framework for 3D source localization using 1D linear arrays that maintains optimal performance in both near-field and far-field scenarios, overcoming the thresholding effect that plagues existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing localization methods using 1D linear arrays suffer from significant performance degradation in far-field scenarios due to the thresholding effect, limiting their practical utility despite cost and size advantages.

Method: Reformulate localization in modified polar representation (MPR) coordinates (azimuth, elevation, inverse-range), develop constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) estimator, transform into tight semidefinite programming (SDP) via semidefinite relaxation with additional constraints.

Result: Proposed estimator attains Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for both angle and inverse-range estimation in near-field scenarios and maintains optimal performance in far-field, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Provides a reliable, unified localization system effective regardless of source range, overcoming fundamental limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for robust three-dimensional (3-D) source localization using a network of sensors equipped with one-dimensional (1-D) linear arrays. While such arrays offer practical advantages in terms of cost and size, existing localization methods suffer from a fundamental limitation: their performance degrades significantly as the source moves into the far-field, a common challenge known as the thresholding effect. To address this issue, we reformulate the localization problem in the modified polar representation (MPR) coordinate system, which parameterizes the source location using its azimuth, elevation, and inverse-range. We have developed a constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) estimator, which is subsequently transformed into a tight semidefinite programming (SDP) problem via semidefinite relaxation, enhanced with additional constraints to improve accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimator attains the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for both angle and inverse-range estimation in near-field scenarios. More importantly, it maintains this optimal performance in the far-field, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, which exhibit significant error at large ranges. The proposed solution thus provides a reliable, unified localization system that is effective irrespective of the source range.

*Yeon-Woo Choi,Hye-Bin Shin,Dan Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A user state-aware EEG filtering framework that improves BCI robustness by estimating cognitive states and adaptively filtering unreliable EEG segments based on attention levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BCIs suffer from limited robustness and poor long-term adaptability due to user attention fluctuations, brain state shifts, and irregular artifacts that degrade model performance.

Method: Continuously estimates user's cognitive state from EEG features and applies adaptive weighting to filter unreliable segments based on estimated attention level, suppressing noisy or out-of-focus epochs.

Result: Experiments on multiple EEG datasets show enhanced classification accuracy and stability across different user states and sessions compared to conventional preprocessing pipelines.

Conclusion: Leveraging brain-derived state information without additional user labels can substantially improve the reliability of practical EEG-based BCIs.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) often suffer from limited robustness and poor long-term adaptability. Model performance rapidly degrades when user attention fluctuates, brain states shift over time, or irregular artifacts appear during interaction. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a user state-aware electroencephalogram (EEG) filtering framework that refines neural representations before decoding user intentions. The proposed method continuously estimates the user's cognitive state (e.g., focus or distraction) from EEG features and filters unreliable segments by applying adaptive weighting based on the estimated attention level. This filtering stage suppresses noisy or out-of-focus epochs, thereby reducing distributional drift and improving the consistency of subsequent decoding. Experiments on multiple EEG datasets that emulate real BCI scenarios demonstrate that the proposed state-aware filtering enhances classification accuracy and stability across different user states and sessions compared with conventional preprocessing pipelines. These findings highlight that leveraging brain-derived state information--even without additional user labels--can substantially improve the reliability of practical EEG-based BCIs.

TL;DR: Proposes an ML-based decoder-only solution for compressed CSI in massive MIMO systems, using standardized encoder and site-specific generative decoder with digital twin for synthetic training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Massive MIMO systems require accurate CSI but face high feedback overhead. ML autoencoders help but create standardization and data collection challenges.

Method: Uses standardized encoder for CSI compression on user side and site-specific generative decoder at base station with goal-oriented loss function. Two training schemes: end-to-end and two-stage, plus digital twin for synthetic CSI data generation.

Result: Simulations show effective performance across various feedback overhead regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed solution addresses standardization, interoperability, and data collection challenges in ML-based CSI reconstruction for massive MIMO systems.

Abstract: Massive MIMO systems can enhance spectral and energy efficiency, but they require accurate channel state information (CSI), which becomes costly as the number of antennas increases. While machine learning (ML) autoencoders show promise for CSI reconstruction and reducing feedback overhead, they introduce new challenges with standardization, interoperability, and backward compatibility. Also, the significant data collection needed for training makes real-world deployment difficult. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an ML-based, decoder-only solution for compressed CSI. Our approach uses a standardized encoder for CSI compression on the user side and a site-specific generative decoder at the base station to refine the compressed CSI using environmental knowledge. We introduce two training schemes for the generative decoder: An end-to-end method and a two-stage method, both utilizing a goal-oriented loss function. Furthermore, we reduce the data collection overhead by using a site-specific digital twin to generate synthetic CSI data for training. Our simulations highlight the effectiveness of this solution across various feedback overhead regimes.

*Chao Zhou,Changsheng You,Cong Zhou,Hai Lin,Yi Gong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes movable XL-arrays for covert communications in mixed-field scenarios, showing improved sum-rate and covertness through flexible subarray movement and channel correlation control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing covert communication works mostly consider either far-field or near-field scenarios separately, but practical systems often have mixed-field scenarios with users at different distances. Fixed-position XL-arrays suffer from energy-spread effect and strict covertness requirements.

Method: Uses modular movable XL-arrays that can adjust subarray positions. Formulates sum-rate maximization under covertness constraint, decomposes into beamforming optimization and subarray movement subproblems, solved using successive convex approximation and customized differential evolution algorithm.

Result: Movable XL-arrays significantly improve sum-rate performance compared to fixed arrays by mitigating energy-spread effect. They also relax covertness requirements by enabling flexible control of channel correlations between legitimate users and eavesdroppers.

Conclusion: Movable XL-arrays effectively balance sum-rate performance and covert communication requirements in mixed-field scenarios, demonstrating superior performance over conventional fixed-position arrays through flexible subarray movement and optimized beamforming.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose to employ a modular-based movable extremely large-scale array (XL-array) at Alice for enhancing covert communication performance. Compared with existing work that mostly considered either far-field or near-field covert communications, we consider in this paper a more general and practical mixed-field scenario, where multiple Bobs are located in either the near-field or far-field of Alice, in the presence of multiple near-field Willies. Specifically, we first consider a two-Bob-one-Willie system and show that conventional fixed-position XL-arrays suffer degraded sum-rate performance due to the energy-spread effect in mixed-field systems, which, however, can be greatly improved by subarray movement. On the other hand, for transmission covertness, it is revealed that sufficient angle difference between far-field Bob and Willie as well as adequate range difference between near-field Bob and Willie are necessary for ensuring covertness in fixed-position XL-array systems, while this requirement can be relaxed in movable XL-array systems thanks to flexible channel correlation control between Bobs and Willie. Next, for general system setups, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable sum-rate under covertness constraint. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two subproblems, corresponding to an inner problem for beamforming optimization given positions of subarrays and an outer problem for subarray movement optimization. Although these two subproblems are still non-convex, we obtain their high-quality solutions by using the successive convex approximation technique and devising a customized differential evolution algorithm, respectively. Last, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed movable XL-array in balancing sum-rate and covert communication requirements.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Optimal power splitting and beamforming design for SWIPT users in DMA-aided MISO systems to minimize transmit power while meeting SINR and EH requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional beamforming architectures by leveraging DMA to reduce RF chains and phase shifters, while handling Lorentzian constraints on amplitude and phase optimizations.

Method: Alternating optimization framework based on semidefinite programming (SDP) with Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH) schemes, including adaptive-radius LCH (ARLCH), considering nonlinear EH models and circuit noise effects.

Result: Proposed design significantly reduces transmit power compared to baseline methods, demonstrating efficiency of ARLCH and optimal power splitting in DMA-assisted SWIPT systems.

Conclusion: The integration of ARLCH and optimal power splitting in DMA-assisted architectures provides an efficient solution for SWIPT systems with reduced hardware complexity and improved performance.

Abstract: This paper presents an optimal power splitting and beamforming design for co-located simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) users in Dynamic Metasurface Antenna (DMA)-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. The objective is to minimize transmit power while meeting users signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and energy harvesting (EH) requirements. The problem is solved via an alternating optimization framework based on semidefinite programming (SDP), where metasurface tunability follows Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH). In contrast to traditional beamforming architectures, DMA-assisted architectures reduce the need for RF chains and phase shifters but require optimization under the Lorentzian constraint limiting the amplitude and phase optimizations. Hence, the proposed method integrates several LCH schemes, including the recently proposed adaptive-radius LCH (ARLCH), and evaluates nonlinear EH models and circuit noise effects. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly reduces transmit power compared with baseline methods, highlighting the efficiency of ARLCH and optimal power splitting in DMA-assisted SWIPT systems.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Three-stage uplink channel estimation protocol for RIS-aided mmWave MISO systems that accounts for mutual coupling effects, using dimension-reduced subspace methods and compressed sensing to improve estimation accuracy and pilot efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of channel estimation in RIS-aided mmWave systems while explicitly accounting for mutual coupling effects between antenna elements, which are often neglected in existing approaches.

Method: Three-stage protocol: Stage I estimates common AoA at BS using dimension-reduced subspace method; Stage II performs MC-aware cascaded channel estimation using CS-based approach; Stage III leverages common AoD to reduce pilot overhead for other users. RIS phase shift training matrix is optimized for MC conditions.

Result: Simulation results show better performance than MC-unaware and existing approaches in terms of estimation accuracy and pilot efficiency, with the designed phase shift training outperforming random phase schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed three-stage MC-aware channel estimation protocol effectively handles mutual coupling effects in RIS-aided mmWave systems, achieving improved accuracy and efficiency while reducing computational complexity through structural exploitation of the cascaded channel.

Abstract: This paper proposes a three-stage uplink channel estimation protocol for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multi-user (MU) millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, where both the base station (BS) and the RIS are equipped with uniform planar arrays (UPAs). The proposed approach explicitly accounts for the mutual coupling (MC) effect, modeled via scattering parameter multiport network theory. In Stage~I, a dimension-reduced subspace-based method is proposed to estimate the common angle of arrival (AoA) at the BS using the received signals across all users. In Stage~II, MC-aware cascaded channel estimation is performed for a typical user. The equivalent measurement vectors for each cascaded path are extracted and the reference column is reconstructed using a compressed sensing (CS)-based approach. By leveraging the structure of the cascaded channel, the reference column is rearranged to estimate the AoA at the RIS, thereby reducing the computational complexity associated with estimating other columns. Additionally, the common angle of departure (AoD) at the RIS is also obtained in this stage, which significantly reduces the pilot overhead for estimating the cascaded channels of other users in Stage~III. The RIS phase shift training matrix is designed to optimize performance in the presence of MC and outperforms random phase scheme. Simulation results validate that the proposed method yields better performance than the MC-unaware and existing approaches in terms of estimation accuracy and pilot efficiency.

Abstract: Semantic communications mark a paradigm shift from bit-accurate transmission toward meaning-centric communication, essential as wireless systems approach theoretical capacity limits. The emergence of generative AI has catalyzed generative semantic communications, where receivers reconstruct content from minimal semantic cues by leveraging learned priors. Among generative approaches, diffusion models stand out for their superior generation quality, stable training dynamics, and rigorous theoretical foundations.

When combined with LDPC coding, enables efficient synergistic interaction between analog modulation and digital code. With analog LDGM for both source coding and modulation, creates harmonious joint source-channel-modulation structure.

Conclusion: NSMs establish promising physical-layer directions for future 6G communication systems, offering high flexibility and complexity-efficient operation through dual graph-based architectures suited to message passing.

Abstract: Nyquist Signaling Modulations (NSMs) are a new signaling paradigm inspired by faster-than-Nyquist principles but based on a distinct approach that enables controlled inter-symbol interference through carefully designed finite-impulse-response filters. NSMs can operate in any number of dimensions, including mixed-dimensional configurations, offering wide flexibility in filter design, optional energy balancing, and preservation of the 2-ASK minimum squared Euclidean distance (MSED). Both real and rational tapped filters are investigated, and closed-form expressions are derived for the optimal real-tap filters in the one-dimensional case (MS-PRS), providing analytical insight and strong agreement with simulated bit-error behavior across wide SNR ranges. The paradigm is conceptually expanded through an analog Low-Density Generator Matrix (LDGM) formulation, which broadens the NSM family and unifies modulation and coding within a single, structurally coherent framework. When combined with LDPC coding, it enables efficient and naturally synergistic interaction between the analog modulation and the digital LDPC code. Alternatively, when analog LDGM is employed for both source coding and modulation, a simple and harmonious joint source-channel-modulation structure emerges. In both configurations, the constituent blocks exhibit dual graph-based architectures suited to message passing, achieving high flexibility and complexity-efficient operation. Collectively, these results establish promising physical-layer directions for future 6G communication systems.

Motivation: To address the challenges of meeting diverse QoS requirements for heterogeneous 5G service classes (eMBB, URLLC, mMTC) under limited spectrum and power resources, overcoming limitations of existing RAN slicing schemes that lack physical-layer realism, slot-level adaptability, and interpretable performance metrics.

Method: Developed a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that jointly allocates bandwidth, power, and MCS indices per slice, incorporating finite blocklength effects, channel misreporting, and correlated fading.

Abstract: The coexistence of heterogeneous service classes in 5G Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC), and Massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC) poses major challenges for meeting diverse Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements under limited spectrum and power resources. Existing radio access network (RAN) slicing schemes typically optimise isolated layers or objectives, lacking physical-layer realism, slot-level adaptability, and interpretable per-slice performance metrics. This paper presents a joint optimisation framework that integrates Dynamic Hybrid Resource Utilisation with MCS-Based Intelligent Layering, formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that jointly allocates bandwidth, power, and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) indices per slice. The model incorporates finite blocklength effects, channel misreporting, and correlated fading to ensure realistic operation. Two modes are implemented: a Baseline Mode that ensures resource-efficient QoS feasibility, and an Ideal-Chaser Mode that minimises deviation from ideal per-slice rates. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves energy efficiencies above $10^7$~kb/J in Baseline Mode and sub-millisecond latency with near-ideal throughput in Ideal-Chaser Mode, outperforming recent optimisation and learning-based methods in delay, fairness, and reliability. The framework provides a unified, interpretable, and computationally tractable solution for dynamic cross-layer resource management in 5G and beyond networks.

*Jialiang Zhu,Hamza Haif,Abdelali Arous,Huseyin Arslan,Arman Farhang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper analyzes waveform-domain NOMA (WD-NOMA) for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, comparing AFDM/OTFS uplink with OFDM downlink against power-domain NOMA using only OFDM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With 3GPP selecting OFDM-based waveforms for 6G ISAC systems, there's a need to address the power imbalance between uplink and echo signals, leading to NOMA scenarios that require efficient waveform design.

Method: Proposes WD-NOMA using AFDM or OTFS for uplink with OFDM for downlink/sensing. Develops AFDM frame design, noise power estimation method, and applies 2D-OMP algorithm for target sensing in delay-Doppler domain.

Result: WD-NOMA ISAC systems with AFDM/OTFS outperform PD-NOMA with only OFDM in BER performance. The proposed NPE method provides additional BER improvements.

Conclusion: Waveform-domain NOMA using AFDM or OTFS for uplink with OFDM for downlink/sensing offers superior performance over power-domain NOMA approaches for future 6G ISAC systems.

Abstract: According to the recent 3GPP decisions on 6G air interface, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based waveforms are the primary candidates for future integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. In this paper, we consider a monostatic sensing scenario in which OFDM is used for the downlink and its reflected echo signal is used for sensing. OFDM and discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) are the options for uplink transmission. When OFDM is used in the uplink, the power difference between this signal and the echo signal leads to a power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) scenario. In contrast, adopting DFT-s-OFDM as uplink signal enables a waveform-domain NOMA(WD-NOMA). Affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) have been proven to be DFT-s-OFDM based waveforms. This work focuses on such a WD-NOMA system, where AFDM or OTFS is used as uplink waveform and OFDM is employed for downlink transmission and sensing. We show that the OFDM signal exhibits additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)-like behavior in the affine domain, allowing it to be modeled as white noise in uplink symbol detection. To enable accurate data detection performance, an AFDM frame design and a noise power estimation (NPE) method are developed. Furthermore, a two-dimensional orthogonal matching pursuit (2D-OMP) algorithm is applied for sensing by iteratively identifying delay-Doppler components of each target. Simulation results demonstrate that the WD-NOMA ISAC system, employing either AFDM or OTFS, outperforms the PD-NOMA ISAC system that uses only the OFDM waveform in terms of bit error rate (BER) performance. Furthermore, the proposed NPE method yields additional improvements in BER.

*Kailong Wang,Athina Petropulu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A novel pilot-aided channel estimation method for MIMO OTFS systems that achieves low overhead and high performance by embedding pilots in the Time-Frequency domain and using sparse signal recovery techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OTFS channel estimation methods either sacrifice communication rate with non-overlapped pilots or increase receiver complexity with sophisticated algorithms for overlapped pilots.

Method: Embed pilots in TF domain with novel guard bins, obtain coarse channel estimates, construct virtual array, formulate sparse signal recovery problem using low-dimensional dictionary matrix from coarse estimates.

Result: Achieves good performance with small number of pilots and guard bins, overhead independent of transmit antenna count, scalable for large MIMO arrays, handles practical pulse-shaping and fractional Doppler effects.

Conclusion: Proposed method provides bandwidth-efficient channel estimation for MIMO OTFS with low overhead, high performance, and good scalability for large antenna arrays.

Abstract: Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has recently garnered attention due to its robustness in high-mobility wireless communication environments. In OTFS, the data symbols are mapped to the Doppler-Delay (DD) domain. In this paper, we address bandwidth-efficient estimation of channel state information (CSI) for MIMO OTFS systems. Existing channel estimation techniques either require non-overlapped DD-domain pilots and associated guard regions across multiple antennas, sacrificing significant communication rate as the number of transmit antennas increases, or sophisticated algorithms to handle overlapped pilots, escalating the cost and complexity of receivers. We introduce a novel pilot-aided channel estimation method that enjoys low overhead while achieving high performance. Our approach embeds pilots within each OTFS burst in the Time-Frequency (TF) domain. We propose a novel use of TF and DD guard bins, aiming to preserve waveform orthogonality on the pilot bins and DD data integrity, respectively. The receiver first obtains low-complexity coarse estimates of the channel parameters. Leveraging the orthogonality, a virtual array (VA) is constructed. This enables the formulation of a sparse signal recovery (SSR) problem, in which the coarse estimates are used to build a low-dimensional dictionary matrix. The SSR solution yields high-resolution estimates of channel parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves good performance with only a small number of pilots and guard bins. Furthermore, the required overhead is independent of the number of transmit antennas, ensuring good scalability of the proposed method for large MIMO arrays. The proposed approach considers practical rectangular transmit pulse-shaping and receiver matched filtering, and also accounts for fractional Doppler effects.

*Panagiotis Gavriilidis,Kyriakos Stylianopoulos,George C. Alexandropoulos*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Asymptotic analysis of MIMO systems with 1-bit RIS under Ricean fading shows that dominant singular values/vectors converge to LoS components, enabling efficient phase configuration using only LoS information via Sign Alignment rule.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient RIS configuration methods that eliminate the need for full channel knowledge and complex optimization, reducing computational complexity while maintaining performance.

Method: Uses random matrix theory for asymptotic analysis, proposes Sign Alignment rule for RIS phase configuration based on LoS components, and develops waterfilling-inspired SA algorithm for RIS element allocation to spatial streams.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows RIS can asymptotically diagonalize MIMO channel, eliminating inter-stream interference. Proposed schemes achieve performance comparable to Riemannian manifold optimization with orders of magnitude lower runtime.

Conclusion: LoS-based RIS configuration is sufficient for near-optimal performance in large systems, enabling efficient OTA spatial multiplexing without transmitter channel knowledge.

Abstract: This paper presents an asymptotic analysis of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems assisted by a 1-bit Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) under Ricean fading conditions. Using random matrix theory, we show that, in the asymptotic regime, the dominant singular values and vectors of the transmitter-RIS and RIS-receiver channels converge to their deterministic Line-of-Sight (LoS) components, almost irrespective of the Ricean factors. This enables RIS phase configuration using only LoS information through a closed-form Sign Alignment (SA) rule that maximizes the channel gain. Furthermore, when the RIS is asymptotically larger than the transceiver arrays, proper RIS configuration can render the end-to-end MIMO channel in the capacity formula asymptotically diagonal, thereby eliminating inter-stream interference and enabling Over-The-Air (OTA) spatial multiplexing without channel knowledge at the transmitter. Building on this result, a waterfilling-inspired SA algorithm that allocates RIS elements to spatial streams, based on the asymptotic singular values and statistical channel parameters, is proposed. Simulation results validate the theoretical analyses, demonstrating that the proposed schemes achieve performance comparable to conventional Riemannian manifold optimization, but with orders of magnitude lower runtime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic communication approaches that map content directly to transmission symbols are difficult to deploy practically, limiting the development of semantic communication technology.

Method: Design a hybrid system where encoded semantic information is inserted into bit information for transmission via conventional digital communication systems using the same spectrum resources, with semantic insertion and extraction schemes.

Result: Experimental validation on a pluto-based SDR platform in real wireless channels demonstrates simultaneous transmission of semantic and bit information.

Conclusion: HybridBSC enables practical deployment of semantic communication using existing infrastructure while achieving efficient transmission of both semantic and bit information.

Abstract: Semantic communication technology is regarded as a method surpassing the Shannon limit of bit transmission, capable of effectively enhancing transmission efficiency. However, current approaches that directly map content to transmission symbols are challenging to deploy in practice, imposing significant limitations on the development of semantic communication. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid bit and semantic communication system, named HybridBSC, in which encoded semantic information is inserted into bit information for transmission via conventional digital communication systems utilizing same spectrum resources. The system can be easily deployed using existing communication architecture to achieve bit and semantic information transmission. Particularly, we design a semantic insertion and extraction scheme to implement this strategy. Furthermore, we conduct experimental validation based on the pluto-based software defined radio (SDR) platform in a real wireless channel, demonstrating that the proposed strategy can simultaneously transmit semantic and bit information.

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end coding framework to enable joint source-channel coding in digital semantic communication systems by addressing the incompatibility between continuous JSCC representations and discrete digital codewords.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing JSCC schemes produce continuous representations incompatible with digital systems using discrete variable-length codewords, creating feasibility issues for physical bit-level rate control in semantic transmission.

Method: Extends information bottleneck theory over noisy channels, uses structural decomposition of encoding for code length and content, creates end-to-end trainable encoder with finite codebook, and employs policy gradient for optimization across non-differentiable operations.

Result: E2EC achieves high inference quality with low bit rates, outperforming representative baselines compatible with digital SemCom systems.

Conclusion: The proposed E2EC framework successfully bridges the gap between continuous JSCC representations and discrete digital systems, enabling efficient semantic transmission with physical bit-level rate control.

Abstract: This paper investigates a key challenge faced by joint source-channel coding (JSCC) in digital semantic communication (SemCom): the incompatibility between existing JSCC schemes that yield continuous encoded representations and digital systems that employ discrete variable-length codewords. It further results in feasibility issues in achieving physical bit-level rate control via such JSCC approaches for efficient semantic transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end coding (E2EC) framework to tackle it. The semantic coding problem is formed by extending the information bottleneck (IB) theory over noisy channels, which is a tradeoff between bit-level communication rate and semantic distortion. With a structural decomposition of encoding to handle code length and content respectively, we can construct an end-to-end trainable encoder that supports the direct compression of a data source into a finite codebook. To optimize our E2EC across non-differentiable operations, e.g., sampling, we use the powerful policy gradient to support gradient-based updates. Experimental results illustrate that E2EC achieves high inference quality with low bit rates, outperforming representative baselines compatible with digital SemCom systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust and efficient read/update operations in distributed storage systems where some servers have limited storage capacity, while addressing server dropout resilience.

Method: Developed new converse arguments and coding designs building on prior work by Jia et al., focusing on systems with S out of N servers having limited storage (1/K_c of message size).

Result: Completely characterized fundamental limits: minimum number of available servers required for feasible update operations and minimum communication costs for read/update operations across different server dropout scenarios.

Conclusion: The work provides comprehensive theoretical foundations for RDCDS with partial storage constraints, establishing optimal performance bounds for robust distributed storage systems.

Abstract: We consider the problem of Robust Dynamic Coded Distributed Storage (RDCDS) with partially storage constrained servers where the goal is to enable robust (resilient to server dropouts) and efficient (as measured by the communication costs) read and update operations, subject to the constraint that the storage at $S$ out of $N$ servers is limited by $1/K_c$ the size of the message. Building upon previously established converse arguments and achievability schemes by Jia et al., in this work we develop a set of new converse arguments and coding designs that enable us to completely characterize the fundamental limits of RDCDS with partially storage constrained servers, i.e., the minimum number of available servers for feasible update operation and the minimum communication costs for read and update operations across various server dropout scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the concept of minimum distance to higher-dimensional subspaces through generalized Hamming weights, and to study these weights for a new family of codes generated by square-free monomials over Cartesian sets.

Method: Defines Cartesian square-free codes generated by evaluating square-free monomials over Cartesian sets, and applies commutative algebraic tools (footprint bound) to derive explicit formulas for some generalized Hamming weights.

Result: Obtains explicit formulas for certain generalized Hamming weights of Cartesian square-free codes and shows how these results extend to evaluation codes over projective spaces.

Conclusion: The commutative algebraic approach using footprint bound successfully computes generalized Hamming weights for Cartesian square-free codes and their projective variants, providing new insights into code structure.

Abstract: The generalized Hamming weights (GHWs) of a linear code C extend the concept of minimum distance, which is the minimum cardinality of the support of all one-dimensional subspaces of C, to the minimum cardinality of the support of all r-dimensional subspaces of the code. In this work, we introduce Cartesian square-free codes, which are linear codes generated by evaluating square-free monomials over a Cartesian set. We use commutative algebraic tools, specifically the footprint bound, to provide explicit formulas for some of the GHWs of this family of codes, and we show how we can translate these results to evaluation codes over the projective space.

TL;DR: Derives Ziv-Zakai Bound for DoA estimation in MIMO radar with closed-form expressions for multi-target scenarios, showing tighter performance than CRB especially at low SNR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical bounds don't account for general input covariance, target statistics, and multiple snapshots in MIMO radar systems, limiting accurate performance analysis.

Method: Developed ZZB that explicitly incorporates input covariance matrix, target RCS statistics, multiple snapshots, and provides compact expressions showing MSE dependence on system parameters.

Result: Numerical simulations validate ZZB tightness in a priori region, show antenna count compresses threshold SNR, and target count shifts bound behavior across SNR regimes.

Conclusion: ZZB provides tighter performance bound than CRB, particularly in low SNR regime, enabling better analysis of MIMO radar DoA estimation performance.

Abstract: This paper derives a Ziv-Zakai Bound (ZZB) on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation in co-located Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar systems and provides closed-form expressions that hold for multi-target scenarios. Unlike classical results that address single-input multiple-output systems with complex Gaussian input signals, the developed ZZB in this paper explicitly accounts for a general input covariance matrix, target radar cross-section statistics and multiple snapshot effects, and admits a compact expression that reveals the dependence of the MSE on the number of transmit antennas, number of targets, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and the transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulations validate the tightness of the ZZB in the a priori dominated region and show how the increase of the number of transmit antennas compresses the threshold SNR for the transition to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) while the variation of the number of targets shifts the bound's behavior across SNR regimes. The analytical results and numerical simulations demonstrate that the ZZB is tighter than the CRB, particularly in the low SNR regime.

TL;DR: Dynamic FDD band assignment in 6G satellite networks improves interference management and achieves up to 94% throughput gain in dense deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G networks with dense satellite constellations face severe interference due to fixed FDD band allocation, requiring more flexible spectrum management.

Method: Joint optimization of dynamic band assignment, user scheduling, and power allocation using equivalence transforms, alternating optimization, and industrial-grade solvers.

Result: Dynamic FDD band assignment significantly outperforms conventional FDD, achieving up to 94% throughput improvement in dense satellite deployments.

Conclusion: Dynamic FDD band assignment is an effective approach for interference management in dense 6G satellite networks, offering substantial performance gains over traditional fixed allocation.

Abstract: 6G networks are expected to integrate low Earth orbit satellites to ensure global connectivity by extending coverage to underserved and remote regions. However, the deployment of dense mega-constellations introduces severe interference among satellites operating over shared frequency bands. This is, in part, due to the limited flexibility of conventional frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, where fixed bands for downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions are employed. In this work, we propose dynamic re-assignment of FDD bands for improved interference management in dense deployments and evaluate the performance gain of this approach. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem that incorporates dynamic band assignment, user scheduling, and power allocation in both directions. This non-convex mixed integer problem is solved using a combination of equivalence transforms, alternating optimization, and state-of-the-art industrial-grade mixed integer solvers. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach of dynamic FDD band assignment significantly enhances system performance over conventional FDD, achieving up to 94\% improvement in throughput in dense deployments.

TL;DR: PQFL is a personalized quantum federated learning framework for anomaly detection that addresses client heterogeneity in quantum hardware, data encoding, and noise levels, achieving significant performance improvements over standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection faces challenges with context-dependent anomalies and limited labeled data. Quantum federated learning helps but struggles with client heterogeneity in hardware capabilities, circuit designs, noise levels, and data encoding methods, making single global models ineffective for non-IID data.

Method: Proposes personalized quantum federated learning (PQFL) that enhances local model training using parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimizers, with a quantum-centric personalization strategy that adapts each client's model to its specific hardware characteristics and data representation.

Result: PQFL significantly improves anomaly detection accuracy, reducing false errors by up to 23%, and achieving gains of 24.2% in AUROC and 20.5% in AUPR compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PQFL demonstrates effectiveness and scalability in practical quantum federated settings by addressing client heterogeneity through personalized model adaptation, making it suitable for real-world quantum network applications.

Abstract: Anomaly detection has a significant impact on applications such as video surveillance, medical diagnostics, and industrial monitoring, where anomalies frequently depend on context and anomaly-labeled data are limited. Quantum federated learning (QFL) overcomes these concerns by distributing model training among several quantum clients, consequently eliminating the requirement for centralized quantum storage and processing. However, in real-life quantum networks, clients frequently differ in terms of hardware capabilities, circuit designs, noise levels, and how classical data is encoded or preprocessed into quantum states. These differences create inherent heterogeneity across clients - not just in their data distributions, but also in their quantum processing behaviors. As a result, training a single global model becomes ineffective, especially when clients handle imbalanced or non-identically distributed (non-IID) data. To address this, we propose a new framework called personalized quantum federated learning (PQFL) for anomaly detection. PQFL enhances local model training at quantum clients using parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimizers, while introducing a quantum-centric personalization strategy that adapts each client's model to its own hardware characteristics and data representation. Extensive experiments show that PQFL significantly improves anomaly detection accuracy under diverse and realistic conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PQFL reduces false errors by up to 23%, and achieves gains of 24.2% in AUROC and 20.5% in AUPR, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability in practical quantum federated settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electronic health record phenotyping often relies on noisy proxy labels that undermine risk prediction reliability. Traditional active learning methods use fixed heuristics and don't ensure phenotype refinement improves prediction performance.

Method: RELEAP adaptively integrates multiple querying strategies and updates its policy based on feedback from downstream models. Evaluated on Duke University Health System cohort for lung cancer risk prediction using logistic regression and penalized Cox survival models.

Result: RELEAP consistently outperformed all baselines - logistic AUC increased from 0.774 to 0.805 and survival C-index from 0.718 to 0.752. Produced smoother, more stable gains than heuristic methods under same labeling budget.

Conclusion: RELEAP optimizes phenotype correction through downstream feedback, offering a scalable, label-efficient paradigm that reduces manual chart review and enhances EHR-based risk prediction reliability.

Abstract: Objective: Electronic health record (EHR) phenotyping often relies on noisy proxy labels, which undermine the reliability of downstream risk prediction. Active learning can reduce annotation costs, but most rely on fixed heuristics and do not ensure that phenotype refinement improves prediction performance. Our goal was to develop a framework that directly uses downstream prediction performance as feedback to guide phenotype correction and sample selection under constrained labeling budgets.
  Materials and Methods: We propose Reinforcement-Enhanced Label-Efficient Active Phenotyping (RELEAP), a reinforcement learning-based active learning framework. RELEAP adaptively integrates multiple querying strategies and, unlike prior methods, updates its policy based on feedback from downstream models. We evaluated RELEAP on a de-identified Duke University Health System (DUHS) cohort (2014-2024) for incident lung cancer risk prediction, using logistic regression and penalized Cox survival models. Performance was benchmarked against noisy-label baselines and single-strategy active learning.
  Results: RELEAP consistently outperformed all baselines. Logistic AUC increased from 0.774 to 0.805 and survival C-index from 0.718 to 0.752. Using downstream performance as feedback, RELEAP produced smoother and more stable gains than heuristic methods under the same labeling budget.
  Discussion: By linking phenotype refinement to prediction outcomes, RELEAP learns which samples most improve downstream discrimination and calibration, offering a more principled alternative to fixed active learning rules.
  Conclusion: RELEAP optimizes phenotype correction through downstream feedback, offering a scalable, label-efficient paradigm that reduces manual chart review and enhances the reliability of EHR-based risk prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how fine-tuning affects privacy vulnerabilities in LLMs processing genomic sequences, building on previous work showing embedding leakage risks.

Method: Applied reconstruction attack pipeline to pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings, implemented DNA-specific tokenization, and conducted comparative analysis of position-specific, nucleotide-type, and privacy changes.

Result: Fine-tuning strengthens resistance to reconstruction attacks across all tested architectures, with XLNet showing the most improvement at 19.8%.

Conclusion: Task-specific optimization through fine-tuning can serve as a privacy enhancement mechanism for LLMs processing sensitive genomic data.

Abstract: This study investigates embedding reconstruction attacks in large language models (LLMs) applied to genomic sequences, with a specific focus on how fine-tuning affects vulnerability to these attacks. Building upon Pan et al.'s seminal work demonstrating that embeddings from pretrained language models can leak sensitive information, we conduct a comprehensive analysis using the HS3D genomic dataset to determine whether task-specific optimization strengthens or weakens privacy protections. Our research extends Pan et al.'s work in three significant dimensions. First, we apply their reconstruction attack pipeline to pretrained and fine-tuned model embeddings, addressing a critical gap in their methodology that did not specify embedding types. Second, we implement specialized tokenization mechanisms tailored specifically for DNA sequences, enhancing the model's ability to process genomic data, as these models are pretrained on natural language and not DNA. Third, we perform a detailed comparative analysis examining position-specific, nucleotide-type, and privacy changes between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. We assess embeddings vulnerabilities across different types and dimensions, providing deeper insights into how task adaptation shifts privacy risks throughout genomic sequences. Our findings show a clear distinction in reconstruction vulnerability between pretrained and fine-tuned embeddings. Notably, fine-tuning strengthens resistance to reconstruction attacks in multiple architectures -- XLNet (+19.8\%), GPT-2 (+9.8\%), and BERT (+7.8\%) -- pointing to task-specific optimization as a potential privacy enhancement mechanism. These results highlight the need for advanced protective mechanisms for language models processing sensitive genomic data, while highlighting fine-tuning as a potential privacy-enhancing technique worth further exploration.

Tested on datasets from web interactions, mobile applications, and e-commerce, the methodology outperforms conventional forecasting and uplift modeling techniques. Product teams can effectively simulate and assess possible interventions prior to deployment thanks to the framework improved interpretability through causal path visualization.

### [220] [When Are Learning Biases Equivalent? A Unifying Framework for Fairness, Robustness, and Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07485)
*Sushant Mehta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a unifying theoretical framework showing that different machine learning bias mechanisms (unfairness, spurious correlations, poor minority performance) produce quantitatively equivalent effects on model performance under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge isolated research communities studying different ML failure modes (fairness, robustness, distribution shifts) by showing these biases are fundamentally related and can be studied under a common framework.

Method: Formalizes biases as violations of conditional independence using information-theoretic measures, proves equivalence conditions between spurious correlations, subpopulation shift, class imbalance, and fairness violations.

Result: Shows that spurious correlation strength α produces equivalent worst-group accuracy degradation as sub-population imbalance ratio r ≈ (1+α)/(1-α). Empirical validation across 6 datasets and 3 architectures confirms predicted equivalences hold within 3% accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework enables principled transfer of debiasing methods across problem domains and unifies literature on fairness, robustness, and distribution shifts under a common perspective.

Abstract: Machine learning systems exhibit diverse failure modes: unfairness toward protected groups, brittleness to spurious correlations, poor performance on minority sub-populations, which are typically studied in isolation by distinct research communities. We propose a unifying theoretical framework that characterizes when different bias mechanisms produce quantitatively equivalent effects on model performance. By formalizing biases as violations of conditional independence through information-theoretic measures, we prove formal equivalence conditions relating spurious correlations, subpopulation shift, class imbalance, and fairness violations. Our theory predicts that a spurious correlation of strength $α$ produces equivalent worst-group accuracy degradation as a sub-population imbalance ratio $r \approx (1+α)/(1-α)$ under feature overlap assumptions. Empirical validation in six datasets and three architectures confirms that predicted equivalences hold within the accuracy of the worst group 3\%, enabling the principled transfer of debiasing methods across problem domains. This work bridges the literature on fairness, robustness, and distribution shifts under a common perspective.

### [221] [Provably Efficient Sample Complexity for Robust CMDP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07486)
*Sourav Ganguly,Arnob Ghosh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First sample complexity guarantee for Robust Constrained MDPs (RCMDPs) with a novel algorithm achieving ε-violation using O(|S||A|H^5/ε²) samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works provide finite-time iteration complexity for RCMDPs but lack sample complexity guarantees, and Markovian policies may fail to be optimal under uncertainty sets.

Method: Proposed Robust constrained Value iteration (RCVI) algorithm using an augmented state space that incorporates remaining utility budget into state representation.

Result: Achieved sample complexity of O(|S||A|H^5/ε²) with at most ε violation using a generative model, and empirical validation shows effectiveness.

Conclusion: First sample complexity guarantee for RCMDPs with practical algorithm that handles worst-case dynamics while satisfying safety constraints.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning policies that maximize cumulative reward while satisfying safety constraints, even when the real environment differs from a simulator or nominal model. We focus on robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), where the agent must maximize reward while ensuring cumulative utility exceeds a threshold under the worst-case dynamics within an uncertainty set. While recent works have established finite-time iteration complexity guarantees for RCMDPs using policy optimization, their sample complexity guarantees remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we first show that Markovian policies may fail to be optimal even under rectangular uncertainty sets unlike the {\em unconstrained} robust MDP. To address this, we introduce an augmented state space that incorporates the remaining utility budget into the state representation. Building on this formulation, we propose a novel Robust constrained Value iteration (RCVI) algorithm with a sample complexity of $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(|S||A|H^5/ε^2)$ achieving at most $ε$ violation using a generative model where $|S|$ and $|A|$ denote the sizes of the state and action spaces, respectively, and $H$ is the episode length. To the best of our knowledge, this is the {\em first sample complexity guarantee} for RCMDP. Empirical results further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [222] [On the Role of Calibration in Benchmarking Algorithmic Fairness for Skin Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07700)
*Brandon Dominique,Prudence Lam,Nicholas Kurtansky,Jochen Weber,Kivanc Kose,Veronica Rotemberg,Jennifer Dy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI models for melanoma detection show performance disparities across demographic subgroups. This paper introduces calibration as a complementary metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics to better assess subgroup biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical adoption of AI models for melanoma detection is hindered by performance disparities across demographic subgroups (gender, race, age). Existing benchmarking focuses on AUROC-based fairness metrics, which don't assess model calibration - the alignment between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes.

Method: Assessed leading skin cancer detection algorithms from ISIC 2020 Challenge on ISIC 2020 and PROVE-AI datasets, comparing models across subgroups defined by sex, race (Fitzpatrick Skin Tone), and age. Used calibration as complementary metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics.

Result: Existing models enhance discriminative accuracy but often over-diagnose risk and exhibit calibration issues when applied to new datasets. Models show performance disparities across demographic subgroups despite good overall accuracy.

Conclusion: Comprehensive model auditing strategies and extensive metadata collection are necessary to achieve equitable AI-driven healthcare solutions. Calibration should be used alongside traditional fairness metrics for more complete model assessment.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have demonstrated expert-level performance in melanoma detection, yet their clinical adoption is hindered by performance disparities across demographic subgroups such as gender, race, and age. Previous efforts to benchmark the performance of AI models have primarily focused on assessing model performance using group fairness metrics that rely on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), which does not provide insights into a model's ability to provide accurate estimates. In line with clinical assessments, this paper addresses this gap by incorporating calibration as a complementary benchmarking metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics. Calibration evaluates the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, offering deeper insights into subgroup biases. We assess the performance of the leading skin cancer detection algorithm of the ISIC 2020 Challenge on the ISIC 2020 Challenge dataset and the PROVE-AI dataset, and compare it with the second and third place models, focusing on subgroups defined by sex, race (Fitzpatrick Skin Tone), and age. Our findings reveal that while existing models enhance discriminative accuracy, they often over-diagnose risk and exhibit calibration issues when applied to new datasets. This study underscores the necessity for comprehensive model auditing strategies and extensive metadata collection to achieve equitable AI-driven healthcare solutions.

### [223] [Methodological Precedence in Health Tech: Why ML/Big Data Analysis Must Follow Basic Epidemiological Consistency. A Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07500)
*Marco Roccetti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Advanced ML and big data analyses amplify methodological flaws rather than correct them. A case study shows that uncorrected selection bias in cohort construction leads to invalid hazard ratios and misleading conclusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that sophisticated analytical methods depend on basic methodological rigor and that advanced analyses cannot compensate for fundamental design flaws in health research.

Method: Applied simple descriptive statistics and national epidemiological benchmarks to a published cohort study on vaccine outcomes and psychiatric events to identify statistical paradoxes and selection bias.

Result: Exposed multiple irreconcilable statistical paradoxes, including implausible risk reductions and contradictory incidence rates, showing reported hazard ratios are mathematical artifacts of selection bias.

Conclusion: Complex health studies must first pass basic epidemiological consistency tests before advanced analyses can be considered valid; robust methods like Propensity Score Matching are essential for causal inference from administrative data.

Abstract: The integration of advanced analytical tools, including Machine Learning (ML) and massive data processing, has revolutionized health research, promising unprecedented accuracy in diagnosis and risk prediction. However, the rigor of these complex methods is fundamentally dependent on the quality and integrity of the underlying datasets and the validity of their statistical design. We propose an emblematic case where advanced analysis (ML/Big Data) must necessarily be subsequent to the verification of basic methodological coherence. This study highlights a crucial cautionary principle: sophisticated analyses amplify, rather than correct, severe methodological flaws rooted in basic design choices, leading to misleading or contradictory findings. By applying simple, standard descriptive statistical methods and established national epidemiological benchmarks to a recently published cohort study on vaccine outcomes and psychiatric events, we expose multiple, statistically irreconcilable paradoxes. These paradoxes, including an implausible risk reduction for a chronic disorder in a high-risk group and contradictory incidence rate comparisons, definitively invalidate the reported hazard ratios (HRs). We demonstrate that the observed effects are mathematical artifacts stemming from an uncorrected selection bias in the cohort construction. This analysis serves as a robust reminder that even the most complex health studies must first pass the test of basic epidemiological consistency before any conclusion drawn from subsequent advanced ML or statistical modeling can be considered valid or publishable. We conclude that robust methods, such as Propensity Score Matching, are essential for achieving valid causal inference from administrative data in the absence of randomization

*Md Motaleb Hossen Manik,Md Zabirul Islam,Ge Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: N-ReLU is a stochastic activation function that replaces ReLU's negative activations with zero-mean Gaussian noise, maintaining expected output while preventing dead neurons and improving optimization robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of dead neurons in standard ReLU caused by its hard zero cutoff, which leads to inactive regions and impaired gradient flow during training.

Method: Replace negative activations in ReLU with Gaussian noise while preserving the same expected output, creating a zero-mean stochastic extension that maintains gradient flow and acts as an annealing-style regularizer.

Result: On MNIST dataset with MLP and CNN architectures, N-ReLU achieved comparable or slightly better accuracy than ReLU, LeakyReLU, PReLU, GELU, and RReLU at moderate noise levels (sigma = 0.05-0.10), with stable convergence and no dead neurons observed.

Conclusion: Lightweight Gaussian noise injection provides a simple yet effective mechanism to enhance optimization robustness without modifying network structures or introducing additional parameters.

Abstract: Activation functions are fundamental for enabling nonlinear representations in deep neural networks. However, the standard rectified linear unit (ReLU) often suffers from inactive or "dead" neurons caused by its hard zero cutoff. To address this issue, we introduce N-ReLU (Noise-ReLU), a zero-mean stochastic extension of ReLU that replaces negative activations with Gaussian noise while preserving the same expected output. This expectation-aligned formulation maintains gradient flow in inactive regions and acts as an annealing-style regularizer during training. Experiments on the MNIST dataset using both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures show that N-ReLU achieves accuracy comparable to or slightly exceeding that of ReLU, LeakyReLU, PReLU, GELU, and RReLU at moderate noise levels (sigma = 0.05-0.10), with stable convergence and no dead neurons observed. These results demonstrate that lightweight Gaussian noise injection offers a simple yet effective mechanism to enhance optimization robustness without modifying network structures or introducing additional parameters.

### [225] [SCALAR: Benchmarking SAE Interaction Sparsity in Toy LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07572)
*Sean P. Fillingham,Andrew Gordon,Peter Lai,Xavier Poncini,David Quarel,Stefan Heimersheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCALAR benchmark measures interaction sparsity between SAE features, and Staircase SAEs with weight-sharing improve sparsity over existing methods while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAEs trained in isolation don't encourage sparse cross-layer connections, inflating extracted circuits and leaving interaction sparsity unexamined.

Method: Introduces SCALAR benchmark and proposes Staircase SAEs using weight-sharing to limit upstream feature duplication across downstream features.

Result: Staircase SAEs improve relative sparsity by 59.67% (feedforward) and 63.15% (transformer blocks) over TopK SAEs, validated on toy model and GPT-2 Small.

Conclusion: Interaction sparsity is crucial for SAEs, and Staircase SAEs provide effective architecture for maintaining sparsity while preserving feature interpretability.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to decompose neural networks into interpretable features and map their connecting circuits. The standard approach trains sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on each layer's activations. However, SAEs trained in isolation don't encourage sparse cross-layer connections, inflating extracted circuits where upstream features needlessly affect multiple downstream features. Current evaluations focus on individual SAE performance, leaving interaction sparsity unexamined. We introduce SCALAR (Sparse Connectivity Assessment of Latent Activation Relationships), a benchmark measuring interaction sparsity between SAE features. We also propose "Staircase SAEs", using weight-sharing to limit upstream feature duplication across downstream features. Using SCALAR, we compare TopK SAEs, Jacobian SAEs (JSAEs), and Staircase SAEs. Staircase SAEs improve relative sparsity over TopK SAEs by $59.67\% \pm 1.83\%$ (feedforward) and $63.15\% \pm 1.35\%$ (transformer blocks). JSAEs provide $8.54\% \pm 0.38\%$ improvement over TopK for feedforward layers but cannot train effectively across transformer blocks, unlike Staircase and TopK SAEs which work anywhere in the residual stream. We validate on a $216$K-parameter toy model and GPT-$2$ Small ($124$M), where Staircase SAEs maintain interaction sparsity improvements while preserving feature interpretability. Our work highlights the importance of interaction sparsity in SAEs through benchmarking and comparing promising architectures.

*Raffi Khatchadourian,Rolando Franco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Smaller LLMs (7B-8B parameters) achieve 100% output consistency in financial tasks, while larger models (120B parameters) show only 12.5% consistency, challenging assumptions that bigger models are always better for production deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial institutions need deterministic LLM outputs for auditability and trust in regulated tasks like reconciliations and regulatory reporting, but nondeterministic outputs (output drift) undermine these requirements.

Method: Developed a finance-calibrated deterministic test harness with greedy decoding, fixed seeds, and SEC structure-aware retrieval; used task-specific invariant checking with finance-calibrated materiality thresholds; evaluated five models across three regulated financial tasks with 480 total runs.

Result: Smaller models (Granite-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B) achieved 100% output consistency at T=0.0, while GPT-OSS-120B showed only 12.5% consistency. Structured tasks (SQL) remained stable even at T=0.2, while RAG tasks showed 25-75% drift.

Conclusion: Output consistency has an inverse relationship with model size, challenging conventional assumptions about model superiority. The framework enables risk-appropriate deployment decisions and compliance-ready AI deployments mapped to financial regulatory requirements.

Abstract: Financial institutions deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) for reconciliations, regulatory reporting, and client communications, but nondeterministic outputs (output drift) undermine auditability and trust. We quantify drift across five model architectures (7B-120B parameters) on regulated financial tasks, revealing a stark inverse relationship: smaller models (Granite-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B) achieve 100% output consistency at T=0.0, while GPT-OSS-120B exhibits only 12.5% consistency (95% CI: 3.5-36.0%) regardless of configuration (p<0.0001, Fisher's exact test). This finding challenges conventional assumptions that larger models are universally superior for production deployment.
  Our contributions include: (i) a finance-calibrated deterministic test harness combining greedy decoding (T=0.0), fixed seeds, and SEC 10-K structure-aware retrieval ordering; (ii) task-specific invariant checking for RAG, JSON, and SQL outputs using finance-calibrated materiality thresholds (plus or minus 5%) and SEC citation validation; (iii) a three-tier model classification system enabling risk-appropriate deployment decisions; and (iv) an audit-ready attestation system with dual-provider validation.
  We evaluated five models (Qwen2.5-7B via Ollama, Granite-3-8B via IBM watsonx.ai, Llama-3.3-70B, Mistral-Medium-2505, and GPT-OSS-120B) across three regulated financial tasks. Across 480 runs (n=16 per condition), structured tasks (SQL) remain stable even at T=0.2, while RAG tasks show drift (25-75%), revealing task-dependent sensitivity. Cross-provider validation confirms deterministic behavior transfers between local and cloud deployments. We map our framework to Financial Stability Board (FSB), Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) requirements, demonstrating practical pathways for compliance-ready AI deployments.

*Georgiy Shakirov,Albert Arakelov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER) for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers, using stochastic type masking to encourage type-agnostic expert specialization rather than type-specific routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HGNNs overrely on node/edge type labels, limiting cross-type knowledge transfer and causing surface-level dependency on semantic roles.

Method: Integrates Mixture-of-Experts into HGT with stochastic masking of type embeddings during routing to promote type-agnostic expert specialization based on latent semantics.

Result: HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and type-separated MoE baseline on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP datasets for link prediction, with experts specializing by semantic patterns rather than node types.

Conclusion: Regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations, establishing a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning.

Abstract: A common practice in heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) is to condition parameters on node/edge types, assuming types reflect semantic roles. However, this can cause overreliance on surface-level labels and impede cross-type knowledge transfer. We explore integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into HGNNs--a direction underexplored despite MoE's success in homogeneous settings. Crucially, we question the need for type-specific experts. We propose Homogeneous Expert Routing (HER), an MoE layer for Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) that stochastically masks type embeddings during routing to encourage type-agnostic specialization. Evaluated on IMDB, ACM, and DBLP for link prediction, HER consistently outperforms standard HGT and a type-separated MoE baseline. Analysis on IMDB shows HER experts specialize by semantic patterns (e.g., movie genres) rather than node types, confirming routing is driven by latent semantics. Our work demonstrates that regularizing type dependence in expert routing yields more generalizable, efficient, and interpretable representations--a new design principle for heterogeneous graph learning.

### [229] [Partial Action Replacement: Tackling Distribution Shift in Offline MARL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07629)
*Yue Jin,Giovanni Montana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPaCQL addresses offline MARL's OOD problem using partial action replacement (PAR) for factorized behavior policies, with theoretical guarantees and empirical superiority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline MARL struggles with evaluating OOD joint actions, especially when behavior policies are factorized (agents act independently during data collection).

Method: Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL) uses partial action replacement (PAR) to update only some agents' actions while keeping others fixed, and dynamically weights PAR strategies based on value estimation uncertainty.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows distribution shift scales linearly with deviating agents rather than exponentially with joint-action space. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance over baselines when offline data has independence structure.

Conclusion: SPaCQL effectively mitigates OOD issues in offline MARL for factorized behavior policies through PAR and uncertainty-aware weighting, with provable theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is severely hampered by the challenge of evaluating out-of-distribution (OOD) joint actions. Our core finding is that when the behavior policy is factorized - a common scenario where agents act fully or partially independently during data collection - a strategy of partial action replacement (PAR) can significantly mitigate this challenge. PAR updates a single or part of agents' actions while the others remain fixed to the behavioral data, reducing distribution shift compared to full joint-action updates. Based on this insight, we develop Soft-Partial Conservative Q-Learning (SPaCQL), using PAR to mitigate OOD issue and dynamically weighting different PAR strategies based on the uncertainty of value estimation. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving that under factorized behavior policies, the induced distribution shift scales linearly with the number of deviating agents rather than exponentially with the joint-action space. This yields a provably tighter value error bound for this important class of offline MARL problems. Our theoretical results also indicate that SPaCQL adaptively addresses distribution shift using uncertainty-informed weights. Our empirical results demonstrate SPaCQL enables more effective policy learning, and manifest its remarkable superiority over baseline algorithms when the offline dataset exhibits the independence structure.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of discriminative MI estimators by reframing the approach from classification to transformation between distributions.

Conclusion: The flow-based approach provides a fundamentally different and effective framework for mutual information estimation with superior scalability and precision.

Abstract: We introduce a novel Mutual Information (MI) estimator that fundamentally reframes the discriminative approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes two differentially private RAG algorithms (MURAG and MURAG-ADA) for multi-query settings that protect sensitive documents while maintaining utility across hundreds of queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG systems risk leaking private information when external corpora contain sensitive data, and existing DP-RAG approaches only work for single queries, which is unrealistic for practical usage.

Method: Two algorithms: MURAG uses individual privacy filters to limit privacy loss based on document retrieval frequency, and MURAG-ADA improves utility by privately releasing query-specific thresholds for more precise document selection.

Result: Experiments show both methods scale to hundreds of queries within practical DP budgets (ε≈10) while preserving meaningful utility across multiple LLMs and datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-query DP-RAG algorithms provide practical privacy protection for realistic RAG usage scenarios without significant utility degradation.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving documents from an external corpus at inference time. When this corpus contains sensitive information, however, unprotected RAG systems are at risk of leaking private information. Prior work has introduced differential privacy (DP) guarantees for RAG, but only in single-query settings, which fall short of realistic usage. In this paper, we study the more practical multi-query setting and propose two DP-RAG algorithms. The first, MURAG, leverages an individual privacy filter so that the accumulated privacy loss only depends on how frequently each document is retrieved rather than the total number of queries. The second, MURAG-ADA, further improves utility by privately releasing query-specific thresholds, enabling more precise selection of relevant documents. Our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods scale to hundreds of queries within a practical DP budget ($\varepsilon\approx10$), while preserving meaningful utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional crime linkage methods struggle with high-dimensional, sparse, and heterogeneous data, limiting their effectiveness in identifying serial offenders and enhancing public safety.

Method: Proposed a Siamese Autoencoder framework that integrates geographic-temporal features at the decoder stage to mitigate signal dilution in sparse feature spaces, using ViCLAS data from UK's National Crime Agency.

Result: The approach yields consistent improvements across multiple evaluation metrics, improving AUC by up to 9% over traditional methods while providing interpretable insights for investigative decision-making.

Conclusion: Advanced machine learning approaches like Siamese Autoencoders can substantially enhance crime linkage accuracy and offer practical guidance for preprocessing in crime linkage contexts.

Abstract: Effective crime linkage analysis is crucial for identifying serial offenders and enhancing public safety. To address limitations of traditional crime linkage methods in handling high-dimensional, sparse, and heterogeneous data, we propose a Siamese Autoencoder framework that learns meaningful latent representations and uncovers correlations in complex crime data. Using data from the Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System (ViCLAS), maintained by the Serious Crime Analysis Section of the UK's National Crime Agency, our approach mitigates signal dilution in sparse feature spaces by integrating geographic-temporal features at the decoder stage. This design amplifies behavioral representations rather than allowing them to be overshadowed at the input level, yielding consistent improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. We further analyze how different domain-informed data reduction strategies influence model performance, providing practical guidance for preprocessing in crime linkage contexts. Our results show that advanced machine learning approaches can substantially enhance linkage accuracy, improving AUC by up to 9% over traditional methods while offering interpretable insights to support investigative decision-making.

Method: Uses character-level autoencoder with fixed dictionary constraints to encode text representations of non-semantic columns and extract high-dimensional feature embeddings for data grouping, reducing memory requirements and training time.

Result: Achieved 80.95% accuracy in top 5 column matching tasks, substantially outperforming traditional NLP approaches like Bag of Words (47.62%).

Conclusion: Bridges gap between character-level neural architectures and enterprise data management, providing automated solution for schema understanding and data profiling of non-semantic datasets at scale.

Abstract: Enterprise relational databases increasingly contain vast amounts of non-semantic data - IP addresses, product identifiers, encoded keys, and timestamps - that challenge traditional semantic analysis. This paper introduces a novel Character-Level Autoencoder (CAE) approach that automatically identifies and groups semantically identical columns in non-semantic relational datasets by detecting column similarities based on data patterns and structures. Unlike conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models that struggle with limitations in semantic interpretability and out-of-vocabulary tokens, our approach operates at the character level with fixed dictionary constraints, enabling scalable processing of large-scale data lakes and warehouses. The CAE architecture encodes text representations of non-semantic relational table columns and extracts high-dimensional feature embeddings for data grouping. By maintaining a fixed dictionary size, our method significantly reduces both memory requirements and training time, enabling efficient processing of large-scale industrial data environments. Experimental evaluation demonstrates substantial performance gains: our CAE approach achieved 80.95% accuracy in top 5 column matching tasks across relational datasets, substantially outperforming traditional NLP approaches such as Bag of Words (47.62%). These results demonstrate its effectiveness for identifying and clustering identical columns in relational datasets. This work bridges the gap between theoretical advances in character-level neural architectures and practical enterprise data management challenges, providing an automated solution for schema understanding and data profiling of non-semantic industrial datasets at scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZeroSim is a transformer-based performance modeling framework for analog circuits that achieves robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without fine-tuning, significantly outperforming baseline models and enabling 13x speedup in circuit optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SPICE simulations are time-consuming for analog circuit performance evaluation, and existing machine learning methods require topology-specific retraining or manual substructure segmentation, which hinders scalability and adaptability in circuit design automation.

Method: Three key strategies: (1) diverse training corpus of 3.6M instances across 60+ amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings using global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention, (3) topology-conditioned parameter mapping that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations.

Result: ZeroSim significantly outperforms baseline models (MLPs, GNNs, transformers) and delivers accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies. When integrated into RL-based parameter optimization, it achieves 13x speedup compared to conventional SPICE simulations.

Conclusion: ZeroSim demonstrates practical value for analog circuit design automation by enabling efficient performance evaluation with robust generalization capabilities, eliminating the need for topology-specific retraining while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Although recent advancements in learning-based analog circuit design automation have tackled tasks such as topology generation, device sizing, and layout synthesis, efficient performance evaluation remains a major bottleneck. Traditional SPICE simulations are time-consuming, while existing machine learning methods often require topology-specific retraining or manual substructure segmentation for fine-tuning, hindering scalability and adaptability. In this work, we propose ZeroSim, a transformer-based performance modeling framework designed to achieve robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies under novel parameter configurations and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without any fine-tuning. We apply three key enabling strategies: (1) a diverse training corpus of 3.6 million instances covering over 60 amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings leveraging global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention to robustly generalize to novel circuits, and (3) a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations. Our experimental results demonstrate that ZeroSim significantly outperforms baseline models such as multilayer perceptrons, graph neural networks and transformers, delivering accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies. Additionally, when integrated into a reinforcement learning-based parameter optimization pipeline, ZeroSim achieves a remarkable speedup (13x) compared to conventional SPICE simulations, underscoring its practical value for a wide range of analog circuit design automation tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient, training-free uncertainty estimation method for LLMs that uses top-K probabilities with adaptive K selection to detect hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations but existing uncertainty estimation methods require multiple samples or extra computation, making them inefficient.

Method: Uses predictive entropy approximation with top-K probabilities and adaptive K selection mechanism to filter low-confidence probabilities without training.

Result: Outperforms expensive state-of-the-art baselines on three free-form question-answering datasets across multiple LLMs.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances LLM trustworthiness by providing efficient uncertainty estimation to detect hallucinations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks but remain vulnerable to hallucinations, generating factually incorrect or misleading outputs. Uncertainty estimation, often using predictive entropy estimation, is key to addressing this issue. However, existing methods often require multiple samples or extra computation to assess semantic entropy. This paper proposes an efficient, training-free uncertainty estimation method that approximates predictive entropy using the responses' top-$K$ probabilities. Moreover, we employ an adaptive mechanism to determine $K$ to enhance flexibility and filter out low-confidence probabilities. Experimental results on three free-form question-answering datasets across several LLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms expensive state-of-the-art baselines, contributing to the broader goal of enhancing LLM trustworthiness.

*Xiaolin Sun,Feidi Liu,Zhengming Ding,ZiZhan Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHIFT is a novel diffusion-based state perturbation attack that breaks existing RL defenses by generating semantically different yet realistic adversarial states, exposing vulnerabilities in current robust RL policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL defenses appear effective but this is due to limitations of existing Lp norm-constrained attacks that can't meaningfully alter image semantics even with large perturbation budgets.

Method: Proposed SHIFT, a policy-agnostic diffusion-based state perturbation attack that generates perturbed states that are semantically different from true states while remaining realistic and history-aligned to avoid detection.

Result: SHIFT effectively breaks all existing RL defenses, including the most sophisticated ones, significantly outperforming existing attacks while being more perceptually stealthy.

Conclusion: RL agents are vulnerable to semantics-aware adversarial perturbations, highlighting the need for developing more robust policies that can withstand such sophisticated attacks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) systems, while achieving remarkable success across various domains, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This is especially a concern in vision-based environments where minor manipulations of high-dimensional image inputs can easily mislead the agent's behavior. To this end, various defenses have been proposed recently, with state-of-the-art approaches achieving robust performance even under large state perturbations. However, after closer investigation, we found that the effectiveness of the current defenses is due to a fundamental weakness of the existing $l_p$ norm-constrained attacks, which can barely alter the semantics of image input even under a relatively large perturbation budget. In this work, we propose SHIFT, a novel policy-agnostic diffusion-based state perturbation attack to go beyond this limitation. Our attack is able to generate perturbed states that are semantically different from the true states while remaining realistic and history-aligned to avoid detection. Evaluations show that our attack effectively breaks existing defenses, including the most sophisticated ones, significantly outperforming existing attacks while being more perceptually stealthy. The results highlight the vulnerability of RL agents to semantics-aware adversarial perturbations, indicating the importance of developing more robust policies.

*Shu Hong,Yongsheng Mei,Mahdi Imani,Tian Lan*

TL;DR: A scalable Bayesian optimization framework for graph-structured domains using low-rank spectral representations and Gaussian process surrogates from sparse observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian optimization struggles with graph-structured domains due to discrete/combinatorial nature; existing methods are impractical for large graphs or have slow convergence.

Method: Uses low-rank spectral representations to build GP surrogates from sparse structural observations, jointly infers graph structure and node representations through learnable embeddings.

Result: Achieves faster convergence and improved optimization performance compared to prior methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient global search and principled uncertainty estimation for graph optimization even with limited data, with theoretical guarantees for structure recovery.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework for optimizing expensive black-box objectives, yet extending it to graph-structured domains remains challenging due to the discrete and combinatorial nature of graphs. Existing approaches often rely on either full graph topology-impractical for large or partially observed graphs-or incremental exploration, which can lead to slow convergence. We introduce a scalable framework for global optimization over graphs that employs low-rank spectral representations to build Gaussian process (GP) surrogates from sparse structural observations. The method jointly infers graph structure and node representations through learnable embeddings, enabling efficient global search and principled uncertainty estimation even with limited data. We also provide theoretical analysis establishing conditions for accurate recovery of underlying graph structure under different sampling regimes. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence and improved optimization performance compared to prior methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of traditional simulation-based optimization methods that are slow, single-problem focused, and computationally intensive.

Method: Deep Reinforcement Learning agent interacts with Physics-Informed Neural Network environment to explore parameter relationships and optimize geometric/physical parameters for micromixer efficiency.

Result: Consistent efficiency improvements across Schmidt number spectrum, with maximum 32% improvement at Schmidt number 13.3 compared to baseline.

Conclusion: Proposed Sci-ML framework outperforms traditional methods and Genetic Algorithm, providing fast, effective multidimensional optimization solutions.

Abstract: Multidimensional optimization has consistently been a critical challenge in engineering. However, traditional simulation-based optimization methods have long been plagued by significant limitations: they are typically capable of optimizing only a single problem at a time and require substantial computational time for meshing and numerical simulation. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging cutting-edge Scientific Machine Learning (Sci-ML) methodologies to overcome these inherent drawbacks of conventional approaches. The proposed method provides instantaneous solutions to a spectrum of complex, multidimensional optimization problems. A micromixer case study is employed to demonstrate this methodology. An agent, operating on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture, serves as the optimizer to explore the relationships between key problem parameters. This optimizer interacts with an environment constituted by a parametric Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which responds to the agent's actions at a significantly higher speed than traditional numerical methods. The agent's objective, conditioned on the Schmidt number is to discover the optimal geometric and physical parameters that maximize the micromixer's efficiency. After training the agent across a wide range of Schmidt numbers, we analyzed the resulting optimal designs. Across this entire spectrum, the achieved efficiency was consistently greater than the baseline, normalized value. The maximum efficiency occurred at a Schmidt number of 13.3, demonstrating an improvement of approximately 32%. Finally, a comparative analysis with a Genetic Algorithm was conducted under equivalent conditions to underscore the advantages of the proposed method.

TL;DR: Proposes a ranking-based algorithm for vehicle relocation in free-floating car-sharing using zone-based optimization and scooter-based personnel transfers, achieving 8.44% improvement over baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the Vehicle Relocation Problem in free-floating car-sharing services to optimize vehicle distribution and improve service efficiency.

Method: Divides service area into zones with similar patterns, then applies ranking-based algorithm using car availability, demand probability density, and trip duration estimates.

Result: Achieved 8.44% average improvement over baseline in total travel time, with MIP solver achieving 19.6% improvement but requiring business rule modifications.

Conclusion: The proposed solution can improve performance metrics by 3%-10% depending on workforce size, offering practical optimization for car-sharing services.

Abstract: The paper addresses the Vehicle Relocation Problem in free-floating car-sharing services by presenting a solution focused on strategies for repositioning vehicles and transferring personnel with the use of scooters. Our method begins by dividing the service area into zones that group regions with similar temporal patterns of vehicle presence and service demand, allowing the application of discrete optimization methods. In the next stage, we propose a fast ranking-based algorithm that makes its decisions on the basis of the number of cars available in each zone, the projected probability density of demand, and estimated trip durations. The experiments were carried out on the basis of real-world data originating from a major car-sharing service operator in Poland. The results of this algorithm are evaluated against scenarios without optimization that constitute a baseline and compared with the results of an exact algorithm to solve the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model. As performance metrics, the total travel time was used. Under identical conditions (number of vehicles, staff, and demand distribution), the average improvements with respect to the baseline of our algorithm and MIP solver were equal to 8.44\% and 19.6\% correspondingly. However, it should be noted that the MIP model also mimicked decisions on trip selection, which are excluded by current services business rules. The analysis of results suggests that, depending on the size of the workforce, the application of the proposed solution allows for improving performance metrics by roughly 3%-10%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) method that integrates temporal difference and Monte Carlo approaches to estimate temporal distances for long-horizon tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on simulated tasks and real-world robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with long-horizon reasoning in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. Temporal difference methods have optimality guarantees but perform worse than Monte Carlo methods, which lack such guarantees but use global updates.

Method: The authors integrate temporal difference and Monte Carlo approaches into a practical GCRL method that fits a quasimetric distance using multistep Monte-Carlo returns.

Result: The method outperforms existing GCRL methods on long-horizon simulated tasks (up to 4000 steps) with visual observations, and enables stitching in real-world robotic manipulation (Bridge setup).

Conclusion: This is the first end-to-end GCRL method that enables multistep stitching in real-world manipulation from unlabeled offline datasets of visual observations.

Abstract: Learning how to reach goals in an environment is a longstanding challenge in AI, yet reasoning over long horizons remains a challenge for modern methods. The key question is how to estimate the temporal distance between pairs of observations. While temporal difference methods leverage local updates to provide optimality guarantees, they often perform worse than Monte Carlo methods that perform global updates (e.g., with multi-step returns), which lack such guarantees. We show how these approaches can be integrated into a practical GCRL method that fits a quasimetric distance using a multistep Monte-Carlo return. We show our method outperforms existing GCRL methods on long-horizon simulated tasks with up to 4000 steps, even with visual observations. We also demonstrate that our method can enable stitching in the real-world robotic manipulation domain (Bridge setup). Our approach is the first end-to-end GCRL method that enables multistep stitching in this real-world manipulation domain from an unlabeled offline dataset of visual observations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a two-stage token-level entropy optimization method for RLVR in MLLMs that transitions from entropy maximization (exploration) to minimization (exploitation) to handle noisy labels and improve reward ranking for GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR for MLLMs relies on high-quality labeled data, but real-world scenarios often have scarce and noisy annotations. Existing unsupervised methods can overfit to incorrect labels and limit reward ranking signals for GRPO.

Method: Two-stage token-level entropy optimization: exploration phase with entropy maximization for diverse outputs and regularization, followed by exploitation phase with entropy minimization for confident predictions.

Result: Consistently outperforms prior approaches across three MLLM backbones (Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B) in diverse noise settings and multiple tasks, unifying external, internal, and entropy-based methods.

Conclusion: The phased entropy optimization strategy enhances noise tolerance in RLVR, delivering robust and superior performance by dynamically guiding models from exploration to exploitation during training.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is highly dependent on high-quality labeled data, which is often scarce and prone to substantial annotation noise in real-world scenarios. Existing unsupervised RLVR methods, including pure entropy minimization, can overfit to incorrect labels and limit the crucial reward ranking signal for Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). To address these challenges and enhance noise tolerance, we propose a novel two-stage, token-level entropy optimization method for RLVR. This approach dynamically guides the model from exploration to exploitation during training. In the initial exploration phase, token-level entropy maximization promotes diverse and stochastic output generation, serving as a strong regularizer that prevents premature convergence to noisy labels and ensures sufficient intra-group variation, which enables more reliable reward gradient estimation in GRPO. As training progresses, the method transitions into the exploitation phase, where token-level entropy minimization encourages the model to produce confident and deterministic outputs, thereby consolidating acquired knowledge and refining prediction accuracy. Empirically, across three MLLM backbones - Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen2.5-VL-3B - spanning diverse noise settings and multiple tasks, our phased strategy consistently outperforms prior approaches by unifying and enhancing external, internal, and entropy-based methods, delivering robust and superior performance across the board.

TL;DR: Extends schedule-free optimization theory to support learning rate schedulers, provides convergence analysis for warmup-stable-decay schedule, and proposes a new adaptive Polyak learning rate schedule with optimal convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current schedule-free theory only supports constant learning rates, while practical implementations use warm-up schedules. There's a gap between theory and practice that needs to be addressed.

Method: Extend last-iterate convergence theory to allow any scheduler, update averaging parameter as function of learning rate, and design new adaptive Polyak learning rate schedule using convexity principles.

Result: Theory shows O(1/√T) convergence rate for warmup-stable-decay schedule. New Polyak schedule achieves optimal anytime last-iterate convergence and performs well on black-box model distillation tasks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The extended theory bridges gap between schedule-free optimization theory and practice, enabling use of schedulers while maintaining convergence guarantees. The proposed Polyak schedule provides optimal convergence with practical performance benefits.

Abstract: The recently proposed schedule-free method has been shown to achieve strong performance when hyperparameter tuning is limited. The current theory for schedule-free only supports a constant learning rate, where-as the implementation used in practice uses a warm-up schedule. We show how to extend the last-iterate convergence theory of schedule-free to allow for any scheduler, and how the averaging parameter has to be updated as a function of the learning rate. We then perform experiments showing how our convergence theory has some predictive power with regards to practical executions on deep neural networks, despite that this theory relies on assuming convexity. When applied to the warmup-stable-decay (wsd) schedule, our theory shows the optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$. We then use convexity to design a new adaptive Polyak learning rate schedule for schedule-free. We prove an optimal anytime last-iterate convergence for our new Polyak schedule, and show that it performs well compared to a number of baselines on a black-box model distillation task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale weather forecasting models like Aurora are accurate but lack transparency, hindering adoption in high-stakes operational settings due to their 'black box' nature.

Method: Used large-scale dataset of embeddings to train linear classifiers that identify three physical concepts: land-sea boundary, extreme temperature events, and atmospheric instability.

Result: Quantitative evidence shows Aurora learns physically consistent features but has limitations in capturing the rarest events.

Conclusion: Interpretability methods are critically needed to validate and build trust in next-generation AI-driven weather models.

Abstract: The high accuracy of large-scale weather forecasting models like Aurora is often accompanied by a lack of transparency, as their internal representations remain largely opaque. This "black box" nature hinders their adoption in high-stakes operational settings. In this work, we probe the physical consistency of Aurora's encoder by investigating whether its latent representations align with known physical and meteorological concepts. Using a large-scale dataset of embeddings, we train linear classifiers to identify three distinct concepts: the fundamental land-sea boundary, high-impact extreme temperature events, and atmospheric instability. Our findings provide quantitative evidence that Aurora learns physically consistent features, while also highlighting its limitations in capturing the rarest events. This work underscores the critical need for interpretability methods to validate and build trust in the next generation of Al-driven weather models.

Motivation: Existing topic modeling methods don't scale to billion-document datasets needed for real-time analysis of massive social media conversations about important social and political issues.

Method: Tensor Latent Dirichlet Allocation (TLDA) with identifiable parameter guarantees, GPU-based implementation, and linear scaling algorithms.

Result: Achieves 3-4x speedup over parallel LDA, scales to billion-document datasets, and enables first large-scale analysis of #MeToo movement and election fraud conversations on Twitter.

Conclusion: TLDA provides social scientists with near real-time analysis capabilities for massive text corpora to study important social and political phenomena at unprecedented scale.

Abstract: This paper proposes a topic modeling method that scales linearly to billions of documents. We make three core contributions: i) we present a topic modeling method, Tensor Latent Dirichlet Allocation (TLDA), that has identifiable and recoverable parameter guarantees and sample complexity guarantees for large data; ii) we show that this method is computationally and memory efficient (achieving speeds over 3-4x those of prior parallelized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) methods), and that it scales linearly to text datasets with over a billion documents; iii) we provide an open-source, GPU-based implementation, of this method. This scaling enables previously prohibitive analyses, and we perform two real-world, large-scale new studies of interest to political scientists: we provide the first thorough analysis of the evolution of the #MeToo movement through the lens of over two years of Twitter conversation and a detailed study of social media conversations about election fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Thus this method provides social scientists with the ability to study very large corpora at scale and to answer important theoretically-relevant questions about salient issues in near real-time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern ML frameworks need to handle multiple conflicting objectives with coupled decision variables across layers, creating a need for multi-objective bilevel learning (MOBL), which remains under-explored.

Method: Proposed weighted-Chebyshev multi-hyper-gradient-descent (WC-MHGD) framework for both deterministic and stochastic settings, with finite-time Pareto-stationarity convergence rate guarantees.

Result: The framework achieves low oracle complexity and enables systematic Pareto front exploration, with extensive experiments confirming theoretical results.

Conclusion: WC-MHGD provides an effective solution for multi-objective bilevel learning problems, addressing both theoretical foundations and practical algorithmic development.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) applications grow increasingly complex in recent years, modern ML frameworks often need to address multiple potentially conflicting objectives with coupled decision variables across different layers. This creates a compelling need for multi-objective bilevel learning (MOBL). So far, however, the field of MOBL remains in its infancy and many important problems remain under-explored. This motivates us to fill this gap and systematically investigate the theoretical and algorithmic foundation of MOBL. Specifically, we consider MOBL problems with multiple conflicting objectives guided by preferences at the upper-level subproblem, where part of the inputs depend on the optimal solution of the lower-level subproblem. Our goal is to develop efficient MOBL optimization algorithms to (1) identify a preference-guided Pareto-stationary solution with low oracle complexity; and (2) enable systematic Pareto front exploration. To this end, we propose a unifying algorithmic framework called weighted-Chebyshev multi-hyper-gradient-descent (WC-MHGD) for both deterministic and stochastic settings with finite-time Pareto-stationarity convergence rate guarantees, which not only implies low oracle complexity but also induces systematic Pareto front exploration. We further conduct extensive experiments to confirm our theoretical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for efficient differentially private optimizers that maintain strong performance while protecting sensitive data during deep learning model training.

Method: Developed DP-AdamW and DP-AdamW-BC (with bias correction), providing theoretical privacy and convergence guarantees, then empirically tested across privacy budgets ε=1,3,7 on text classification, image classification, and graph node classification tasks.

Result: DP-AdamW outperforms DP-SGD, DP-Adam, and DP-AdamBC by over 15% on text classification, up to 5% on image classification, and consistently 1% on graph node classification. DP-AdamW-BC with bias correction consistently decreases accuracy.

Conclusion: DP-AdamW is an effective differentially private optimizer, but bias correction in this context negatively impacts performance, contrary to expectations from non-private settings.

Abstract: As deep learning methods increasingly utilize sensitive data on a widespread scale, differential privacy (DP) offers formal guarantees to protect against information leakage during model training. A significant challenge remains in implementing DP optimizers that retain strong performance while preserving privacy. Recent advances introduced ever more efficient optimizers, with AdamW being a popular choice for training deep learning models because of strong empirical performance. We study \emph{DP-AdamW} and introduce \emph{DP-AdamW-BC}, a differentially private variant of the AdamW optimizer with DP bias correction for the second moment estimator. We start by showing theoretical results for privacy and convergence guarantees of DP-AdamW and DP-AdamW-BC. Then, we empirically analyze the behavior of both optimizers across multiple privacy budgets ($ε= 1, 3, 7$). We find that DP-AdamW outperforms existing state-of-the-art differentially private optimizers like DP-SGD, DP-Adam, and DP-AdamBC, scoring over 15\% higher on text classification, up to 5\% higher on image classification, and consistently 1\% higher on graph node classification. Moreover, we empirically show that incorporating bias correction in DP-AdamW (DP-AdamW-BC) consistently decreases accuracy, in contrast to the improvement of DP-AdamBC improvement over DP-Adam.

*Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A general framework using Universal Approximation Modules (UAMs) to prove universal approximation properties across diverse deep learning architectures, eliminating the need for architecture-specific proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing universal approximation proofs are model-specific, requiring new proofs for each architecture and lacking unified theoretical understanding across different network families.

Method: Define basic building blocks with universal approximation property as UAMs, then show that any network composed of such modules retains universal approximation through progressive refinement.

Result: Provides a unified framework that can prove universal approximation for diverse architectures without requiring architecture-specific proofs.

Conclusion: The UAM framework enables modular analysis of universal approximation across different network architectures and provides insights into how expressive power evolves through networks.

Abstract: Deep learning architectures are highly diverse. To prove their universal approximation properties, existing works typically rely on model-specific proofs. Generally, they construct a dedicated mathematical formulation for each architecture (e.g., fully connected networks, CNNs, or Transformers) and then prove their universal approximability. However, this approach suffers from two major limitations: first, every newly proposed architecture often requires a completely new proof from scratch; second, these proofs are largely isolated from one another, lacking a common analytical foundation. This not only incurs significant redundancy but also hinders unified theoretical understanding across different network families. To address these issues, this paper proposes a general and modular framework for proving universal approximation. We define a basic building block (comprising one or multiple layers) that possesses the universal approximation property as a Universal Approximation Module (UAM). Under this condition, we show that any deep network composed of such modules inherently retains the universal approximation property. Moreover, the overall approximation process can be interpreted as a progressive refinement across modules. This perspective not only unifies the analysis of diverse architectures but also enables a step-by-step understanding of how expressive power evolves through the network.

*Shihao Li,Jiachen Li,Jiamin Xu,Christopher Martin,Wei Li,Dongmei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Trajectory value in policy-gradient control depends on the learning algorithm. Vanilla REINFORCE shows negative correlation between Persistence of Excitation and marginal value due to variance effects, while stabilized methods show positive correlation as information dominates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how trajectory value depends on the learning algorithm in policy-gradient control and investigate the mechanisms behind different correlations between Persistence of Excitation and marginal value.

Method: Used Trajectory Shapley in uncertain LQR, analyzed variance-mediated mechanism, compared vanilla REINFORCE with stabilized methods (state whitening/Fisher preconditioning), and conducted experiments with Leave-One-Out scores.

Result: Found negative correlation (r≈-0.38) between PE and marginal value under vanilla REINFORCE due to variance effects, but positive correlation (r≈+0.29) under stabilized methods where information dominates. Decision-aligned scores complement Shapley for pruning.

Conclusion: Trajectory value is algorithm-relative, with variance effects driving negative correlation in vanilla methods and information effects driving positive correlation in stabilized methods. Shapley identifies toxic subsets while complementary methods aid pruning.

Abstract: We study how trajectory value depends on the learning algorithm in policy-gradient control. Using Trajectory Shapley in an uncertain LQR, we find a negative correlation between Persistence of Excitation (PE) and marginal value under vanilla REINFORCE ($r\approx-0.38$). We prove a variance-mediated mechanism: (i) for fixed energy, higher PE yields lower gradient variance; (ii) near saddles, higher variance increases escape probability, raising marginal contribution. When stabilized (state whitening or Fisher preconditioning), this variance channel is neutralized and information content dominates, flipping the correlation positive ($r\approx+0.29$). Hence, trajectory value is algorithm-relative. Experiments validate the mechanism and show decision-aligned scores (Leave-One-Out) complement Shapley for pruning, while Shapley identifies toxic subsets.

TL;DR: A hierarchical meta-cognitive framework improves four-class motor imagery EEG classification by combining multi-scale temporal processing with uncertainty estimation, enhancing robustness to subject variability and noisy signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical deployment of motor imagery BCIs is limited by noise and variability in EEG signals, requiring more robust decoding methods that can handle subject heterogeneity and unreliable trials.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical framework with multi-scale signal processing module that reorganizes backbone features into temporal representations, plus an introspective uncertainty module that assigns per-cycle reliability scores for iterative refinement. Tested on three EEG backbones (EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, DeepConvNet) using BCI Competition IV-2a dataset.

Result: Across all backbones, the framework improved average classification accuracy and reduced inter-subject variance compared to baselines, indicating increased robustness to subject heterogeneity and noisy trials.

Conclusion: Combining hierarchical multi-scale processing with introspective confidence estimation enhances reliability of motor imagery-based BCI systems.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) aims to decode motor intent from noninvasive neural signals to enable control of external devices, but practical deployment remains limited by noise and variability in motor imagery (MI)-based electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. This work investigates a hierarchical and meta-cognitive decoding framework for four-class MI classification. We introduce a multi-scale hierarchical signal processing module that reorganizes backbone features into temporal multi-scale representations, together with an introspective uncertainty estimation module that assigns per-cycle reliability scores and guides iterative refinement. We instantiate this framework on three standard EEG backbones (EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet) and evaluate four-class MI decoding using the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset under a subject-independent setting. Across all backbones, the proposed components improve average classification accuracy and reduce inter-subject variance compared to the corresponding baselines, indicating increased robustness to subject heterogeneity and noisy trials. These results suggest that combining hierarchical multi-scale processing with introspective confidence estimation can enhance the reliability of MI-based BCI systems.

TL;DR: A generalized spectral framework unifies learning dynamics and compression phenomena using an asymptotically polynomial spectral evolution function, recovering existing theories as special cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile apparently distinct scaling behaviors reported for model training and compression by developing a unified theoretical framework.

Method: Developed a generalized spectral framework with an asymptotically polynomial spectral evolution function g(λ,t;β) characterized by effective spectral-temporal elasticity ρ(β).

Result: The framework recovers existing lazy and feature-learning theories as special cases and yields an invariant relation between learning and compression.

Conclusion: The generalized spectral framework provides a unified theoretical foundation that connects learning dynamics and compression phenomena through a common functional ansatz.

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws describe how test loss and other performance metrics depend on model size, dataset size, and compute. While such laws are consistent within specific regimes, apparently distinct scaling behaviors have been reported for related settings such as model compression. Motivated by recent progress in spectral analyses of neural representations, this paper develops a \emph{generalized spectral framework} that unifies learning dynamics and compression phenomena under a common functional ansatz. We generalize the spectral evolution function from the linear kernel form $g(λt)=λt$ to an asymptotically polynomial function $g(λ,t;β)$, characterized by an effective spectral--temporal elasticity $ρ(β)$. This framework recovers existing lazy and feature-learning theories as special cases and yields an invariant relation between learning and compression

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A conformal prediction framework provides probabilistic safety guarantees for learned Hamilton-Jacobi value functions and policies in autonomous systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis is computationally expensive for high-dimensional systems, and learned value functions/policies lack formal safety guarantees.

Method: Use conformal prediction to calibrate switching between unsafe nominal controllers and learned HJ-based safe policies, and investigate ensemble methods for safety filtering.

Result: The framework provides probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent reaching failure states.

Conclusion: Conformal prediction enables practical safety assurance for learning-enabled autonomous systems by bounding uncertainty in learned value functions.

Abstract: Safety assurance is a fundamental requirement for deploying learning-enabled autonomous systems. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental method for formally verifying safety and generating safe controllers. However, computing the HJ value function that characterizes the backward reachable set (BRS) of a set of user-defined failure states is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional systems, motivating the use of reinforcement learning approaches to approximate the value function. Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone.

TL;DR: Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) replaces single reward functions with multiple test functions to simplify task definition and improve policy learning, outperforming handcrafted reward methods on DeepMind Control Suite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL reward functions are challenging to design manually and often result in suboptimal task representation because they serve dual purposes of defining goals and guiding learning.

Method: Proposed TdRL framework uses pass-fail tests for defining optimal objectives and indicative tests for guiding learning. Uses lexicographic heuristic to compare trajectory distances to optimal set and maximum entropy policy optimization.

Result: Experimental results on DeepMind Control Suite show TdRL matches or outperforms handcrafted reward methods in policy training, with greater design simplicity and inherent multi-objective optimization support.

Conclusion: TdRL provides a novel perspective for representing task objectives that helps address reward design challenges in RL applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been recognized as a powerful tool for robot control tasks. RL typically employs reward functions to define task objectives and guide agent learning. However, since the reward function serves the dual purpose of defining the optimal goal and guiding learning, it is challenging to design the reward function manually, which often results in a suboptimal task representation. To tackle the reward design challenge in RL, inspired by the satisficing theory, we propose a Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) framework. In the TdRL framework, multiple test functions are used to represent the task objective rather than a single reward function. Test functions can be categorized as pass-fail tests and indicative tests, each dedicated to defining the optimal objective and guiding the learning process, respectively, thereby making defining tasks easier. Building upon such a task definition, we first prove that if a trajectory return function assigns higher returns to trajectories closer to the optimal trajectory set, maximum entropy policy optimization based on this return function will yield a policy that is closer to the optimal policy set. Then, we introduce a lexicographic heuristic approach to compare the relative distance relationship between trajectories and the optimal trajectory set for learning the trajectory return function. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm implementation of TdRL. Experimental results on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark demonstrate that TdRL matches or outperforms handcrafted reward methods in policy training, with greater design simplicity and inherent support for multi-objective optimization. We argue that TdRL offers a novel perspective for representing task objectives, which could be helpful in addressing the reward design challenges in RL applications.

Abstract: We introduce CellARC, a synthetic benchmark for abstraction and reasoning built from multicolor 1D cellular automata (CA). Each episode has five support pairs and one query serialized in 256 tokens, enabling rapid iteration with small models while exposing a controllable task space with explicit knobs for alphabet size k, radius r, rule family, Langton's lambda, query coverage, and cell entropy. We release 95k training episodes plus two 1k test splits (interpolation/extrapolation) and evaluate symbolic, recurrent, convolutional, transformer, recursive, and LLM baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified Flow models primarily use ODEs, but recent research shows that noise injection through SDEs can enhance generative performance. This paper aims to leverage positive-incentive noise to improve existing RF models.

Method: Proposed Rectified Noise (ΔRN) algorithm that trains π-noise generators to inject positive-incentive noise into the velocity field of pre-trained Rectified Flow models, transforming them into π-noise generators.

Result: RF models using Rectified Noise reduced FID from 10.16 to 9.05 on ImageNet-1k, achieving improved performance with only 0.39% additional training parameters across various model architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: Rectified Noise provides an efficient way to enhance pre-trained Rectified Flow models by injecting positive-incentive noise, significantly improving generative performance with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Rectified Flow (RF) has been widely used as an effective generative model. Although RF is primarily based on probability flow Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), recent studies have shown that injecting noise through reverse-time Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) for sampling can achieve superior generative performance. Inspired by Positive-incentive Noise ($π$-noise), we propose an innovative generative algorithm to train $π$-noise generators, namely Rectified Noise ($Δ$RN), which improves the generative performance by injecting $π$-noise into the velocity field of pre-trained RF models. After introducing the Rectified Noise pipeline, pre-trained RF models can be efficiently transformed into $π$-noise generators. We validate Rectified Noise by conducting extensive experiments across various model architectures on different datasets. Notably, we find that: (1) RF models using Rectified Noise reduce FID from \textbf{10.16 to 9.05} on ImageNet-1k. (2) The models of $π$-noise generators achieve improved performance with only \textbf{0.39\%} additional training parameters.

TL;DR: Feedback Descent is a framework that optimizes text artifacts using structured textual feedback instead of scalar rewards, enabling directed optimization in text space without modifying model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the information bottleneck in preference learning by preserving detailed critiques rather than compressing them to binary preferences, enabling more effective optimization of text artifacts.

Method: Uses in-context learning to transform structured feedback into gradient-like directional information for targeted edits, with evaluators providing textual feedback paired with comparisons as high-bandwidth supervision.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods across three domains, including identifying novel drug-like molecules surpassing the 99.9th percentile of a 260,000+ compound database across six protein targets.

Conclusion: Feedback Descent provides an effective framework for optimizing text artifacts through structured feedback, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods while operating purely at inference time without weight modification.

Abstract: We introduce \textit{Feedback Descent}, a framework that optimizes text artifacts -- prompts, code, and molecules -- through structured textual feedback, rather than relying solely on scalar rewards. By preserving detailed critiques instead of compressing them to binary preferences, Feedback Descent widens the information bottleneck in preference learning, enabling directed optimization in text space rather than weight space. We show that in-context learning can transform structured feedback into gradient-like directional information, enabling targeted edits. Unlike prior approaches that collapse judgments into single bits, our evaluators pair each comparison with textual feedback, which functions as high-bandwidth supervision. The iteration loop is done purely at inference time, without modifying any model weights, and is task-agnostic. We evaluate Feedback Descent on three diverse domains and find that it outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization (GEPA), reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, REINVENT), and even specialized graph-based molecular optimizers. In the DOCKSTRING molecule discovery benchmark, Feedback Descent identifies novel drug-like molecules surpassing the $99.9$th percentile of a database with more than $260{,}000$ compounds across six protein targets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SERL is a self-improving RL framework where LLMs act as both Actor and Judge, using internal pairwise comparisons and self-consistency rewards to improve without external signals, achieving state-of-the-art performance on open-domain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of RLVR (requires verifiable rewards) and RLHF (relies on external rewards) for open-domain tasks where rewards are subjective and external mechanisms are unavailable.

Method: Proposes Self-Examining Reinforcement Learning (SERL) with two internal reward mechanisms: Copeland-style pairwise comparison judgments for Actor improvement and self-consistency rewards for Judge reliability enhancement.

Result: Improves Qwen3-8B's LC win rate on AlpacaEval 2 from 52.37% to 59.90%, achieving state-of-the-art performance among self-improving approaches and comparable performance to much larger models like Qwen3-32B.

Conclusion: SERL demonstrates superior effectiveness and robustness for open-domain tasks by enabling self-improvement without external reward signals, making it a practical solution for RL in subjective domains.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to improve the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, applying RL to open-domain tasks faces two key challenges: (1) the inherent subjectivity of these tasks prevents the verifiable rewards as required by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR); (2) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) relies on external reward mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Self-Examining Reinforcement Learning (SERL), a novel self-improving framework where the LLM serves as both Actor and Judge. SERL introduces two synergistic reward mechanisms without any external signals. On the one hand, to improve the Actor's capability, we derive rewards from Copeland-style pairwise comparison judgments across a group of generated responses. On the other hand, a self-consistency reward that encourages coherent judgments is proposed to improve the Judge's reliability. This process refines the Judge's capability, which in turn provides a more robust reward for Actor. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing self-improvement training methods. SERL improves the LC win rate of Qwen3-8B on AlpacaEval 2 from 52.37% to 59.90%. To the best of our knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-improving approaches. Furthermore, it achieves a performance comparable to significantly larger models like Qwen3-32B, demonstrating superior effectiveness and robustness on open-domain tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting has limited augmentation strategies compared to other fields, with advanced techniques like Mixup rarely being used, creating a need for more effective data augmentation methods.

Method: IBMA combines Imputation-Augmented data with Mixup augmentation, evaluated on DLinear (MLP), TimesNet (CNN), and iTrainformer (Transformer) models across four ETT datasets.

Result: IBMA consistently enhanced performance, achieving 22 improvements out of 24 instances, with 10 being the best performances, particularly with iTrainformer imputation.

Conclusion: IBMA is an effective data augmentation method that significantly improves time series forecasting performance across various models and datasets.

Abstract: Data augmentation in time series forecasting plays a crucial role in enhancing model performance by introducing variability while maintaining the underlying temporal patterns. However, time series data offers fewer augmentation strategies compared to fields such as image or text, with advanced techniques like Mixup rarely being used. In this work, we propose a novel approach, Imputation-Based Mixup Augmentation (IBMA), which combines Imputation-Augmented data with Mixup augmentation to bolster model generalization and improve forecasting performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of this method across several forecasting models, including DLinear (MLP), TimesNet (CNN), and iTrainformer (Transformer), these models represent some of the most recent advances in time series forecasting. Our experiments, conducted on four datasets (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2) and compared against eight other augmentation techniques, demonstrate that IBMA consistently enhances performance, achieving 22 improvements out of 24 instances, with 10 of those being the best performances, particularly with iTrainformer imputation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional predict-then-optimize pipelines assume fixed task configurations and generalize poorly to evolving scheduling tasks caused by varying seaport vessel arrivals.

Method: Fisher information based regularization to preserve parameters critical to prior tasks, plus a differentiable convex surrogate for stable gradient backpropagation in end-to-end training.

Result: Superior decision performance and generalization over existing methods with reduced computational cost, demonstrated through experiments calibrated to Jurong Port.

Conclusion: The framework enables learning decision-aligned forecasting models for new scheduling tasks while retaining generalization on earlier tasks, addressing the gap in handling evolving task structures.

Abstract: Power-logistics scheduling in modern seaports typically follow a predict-then-optimize pipeline. To enhance decision quality, decision-focused learning has been proposed to align forecasting and optimization via end-to-end training. However, most formulations assume a fixed task configuration in downstream optimization, and thus generalize poorly to evolving task structures induced by varying seaport vessel arrivals. We address this gap with a decision-focused continual learning framework that adapts online to a stream of scheduling tasks. Specifically, we introduce Fisher information based regularization to enhance cross-task generalization by preserving parameters critical to prior tasks. A differentiable convex surrogate is also developed to stabilize gradient backpropagation. The proposed approach enables learning a decision-aligned forecasting model for new scheduling tasks while retaining generalization on earlier tasks. Experiments calibrated to the Jurong Port demonstrate superior decision performance and generalization over existing methods with reduced computational cost.

*Rishabh Agrawal,Yusuf Alvi,Rahul Jain,Ashutosh Nayyar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distributionally robust offline imitation learning framework that learns policies robust to environment dynamics shifts using only expert demonstrations from nominal conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard imitation learning assumes fixed environment dynamics, but real-world scenarios often have modeling errors, parameter variations, and adversarial perturbations that cause performance degradation when dynamics shift.

Method: Formulates the problem as distributionally robust optimization over transition model uncertainty sets, minimizing imitation loss under worst-case transitions. Shows this can be reformulated using only nominal data distribution for tractable offline learning.

Result: Empirical evaluations on continuous-control benchmarks show superior robustness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art offline IL baselines, especially under perturbed or shifted environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables learning robust policies from expert demonstrations without additional environment interaction, effectively handling dynamics shifts that commonly occur in real-world applications.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) has proven highly effective for robotic and control tasks where manually designing reward functions or explicit controllers is infeasible. However, standard IL methods implicitly assume that the environment dynamics remain fixed between training and deployment. In practice, this assumption rarely holds where modeling inaccuracies, real-world parameter variations, and adversarial perturbations can all induce shifts in transition dynamics, leading to severe performance degradation. We address this challenge through Balance Equation-based Distributionally Robust Offline Imitation Learning, a framework that learns robust policies solely from expert demonstrations collected under nominal dynamics, without requiring further environment interaction. We formulate the problem as a distributionally robust optimization over an uncertainty set of transition models, seeking a policy that minimizes the imitation loss under the worst-case transition distribution. Importantly, we show that this robust objective can be reformulated entirely in terms of the nominal data distribution, enabling tractable offline learning. Empirical evaluations on continuous-control benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior robustness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art offline IL baselines, particularly under perturbed or shifted environments.

TL;DR: First systematic study of continual unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models, showing existing methods fail due to cumulative parameter drift and proposing regularization techniques to address this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods assume all requests arrive at once, but in practice they arrive sequentially, leading to rapid utility collapse where models forget retained knowledge after few requests.

Method: Study add-on regularizers to mitigate parameter drift, including a gradient-projection method that constrains drift orthogonal to semantic subspaces, compatible with existing unlearning methods.

Result: Regularization substantially improves continual unlearning performance, with semantic-aware gradient-projection providing complementary gains to other regularizers.

Conclusion: Establishes continual unlearning as a fundamental challenge in text-to-image generation and provides insights and baselines for advancing safe and accountable generative AI.

Abstract: Machine unlearning--the ability to remove designated concepts from a pre-trained model--has advanced rapidly, particularly for text-to-image diffusion models. However, existing methods typically assume that unlearning requests arrive all at once, whereas in practice they often arrive sequentially. We present the first systematic study of continual unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models and show that popular unlearning methods suffer from rapid utility collapse: after only a few requests, models forget retained knowledge and generate degraded images. We trace this failure to cumulative parameter drift from the pre-training weights and argue that regularization is crucial to addressing it. To this end, we study a suite of add-on regularizers that (1) mitigate drift and (2) remain compatible with existing unlearning methods. Beyond generic regularizers, we show that semantic awareness is essential for preserving concepts close to the unlearning target, and propose a gradient-projection method that constrains parameter drift orthogonal to their subspace. This substantially improves continual unlearning performance and is complementary to other regularizers for further gains. Taken together, our study establishes continual unlearning as a fundamental challenge in text-to-image generation and provides insights, baselines, and open directions for advancing safe and accountable generative AI.

Motivation: Existing zeroth-order methods for fine-tuning LLMs suffer from high variance and suboptimal search directions due to random gradient estimation, leading to inefficient optimization.

Method: LOREN reformulates gradient preconditioning as adaptive anisotropic perturbation distribution estimation, uses natural evolution strategies for low-rank block diagonal preconditioning to capture curvature, and applies REINFORCE leave-one-out estimator to reduce variance.

Result: LOREN outperforms state-of-the-art ZO methods with higher accuracy and faster convergence, while reducing peak memory usage by up to 27.3% compared to MeZO-Adam on standard LLM benchmarks.

Conclusion: LOREN provides an effective curvature-aware zeroth-order optimization approach for LLM fine-tuning that addresses key limitations of existing methods through improved gradient estimation and preconditioning.

Abstract: We introduce LOREN, a curvature-aware zeroth-order (ZO) optimization method for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Existing ZO methods, which estimate gradients via finite differences using random perturbations, often suffer from high variance and suboptimal search directions. Our approach addresses these challenges by: (i) reformulating the problem of gradient preconditioning as that of adaptively estimating an anisotropic perturbation distribution for gradient estimation, (ii) capturing curvature through a low-rank block diagonal preconditioner using the framework of natural evolution strategies, and (iii) applying a REINFORCE leave-one-out (RLOO) gradient estimator to reduce variance. Experiments on standard LLM benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art ZO methods by achieving higher accuracy and faster convergence, while cutting peak memory usage by up to 27.3% compared with MeZO-Adam.

Conclusion: Distilled generalizable insights about effective graph transformer design, training, and inference based on comprehensive theoretical analysis and large-scale empirical validation across diverse domains.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have shown strong empirical performance, yet current architectures vary widely in their use of attention mechanisms, positional embeddings (PEs), and expressivity. Existing expressivity results are often tied to specific design choices and lack comprehensive empirical validation on large-scale data. This leaves a gap between theory and practice, preventing generalizable insights that exceed particular application domains. Here, we propose the Generalized-Distance Transformer (GDT), a GT architecture using standard attention that incorporates many advancements for GTs from recent years, and develop a fine-grained understanding of the GDT's representation power in terms of attention and PEs. Through extensive experiments, we identify design choices that consistently perform well across various applications, tasks, and model scales, demonstrating strong performance in a few-shot transfer setting without fine-tuning. Our evaluation covers over eight million graphs with roughly 270M tokens across diverse domains, including image-based object detection, molecular property prediction, code summarization, and out-of-distribution algorithmic reasoning. We distill our theoretical and practical findings into several generalizable insights about effective GT design, training, and inference.

Method: Introduces R-DFL with bidirectional feedback and extends two differentiation methods: explicit unrolling via automatic differentiation and implicit differentiation based on fixed-point methods.

Result: R-DFL substantially enhances final decision quality over sequential baselines and exhibits robust adaptability across diverse scenarios in closed-loop decision-making problems.

Conclusion: R-DFL provides a more effective framework for decision-focused learning by enabling bidirectional feedback between prediction and optimization, with both differentiation methods achieving comparable gradient accuracy.

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) has emerged as a powerful end-to-end alternative to conventional predict-then-optimize (PTO) pipelines by directly optimizing predictive models through downstream decision losses. Existing DFL frameworks are limited by their strictly sequential structure, referred to as sequential DFL (S-DFL). However, S-DFL fails to capture the bidirectional feedback between prediction and optimization in complex interaction scenarios. In view of this, we first time propose recursive decision-focused learning (R-DFL), a novel framework that introduces bidirectional feedback between downstream optimization and upstream prediction. We further extend two distinct differentiation methods: explicit unrolling via automatic differentiation and implicit differentiation based on fixed-point methods, to facilitate efficient gradient propagation in R-DFL. We rigorously prove that both methods achieve comparable gradient accuracy, with the implicit method offering superior computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the newsvendor problem and the bipartite matching problem, demonstrate that R-DFL not only substantially enhances the final decision quality over sequential baselines but also exhibits robust adaptability across diverse scenarios in closed-loop decision-making problems.

TL;DR: DynaAct automatically constructs compact action spaces for sequential decision-making by extracting general sketches from diverse reasoning problems and selecting optimal actions using submodular optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches use manually defined action spaces that lack scalability or unstructured spaces that make exhaustive search computationally prohibitive, limiting efficient inference in sequential reasoning systems.

Method: Extracts general action sketches from diverse reasoning problems using LLMs, formulates submodular function to evaluate actions based on utility and diversity, and uses greedy algorithm to select optimal candidate set.

Result: Significantly improves overall performance on six diverse standard benchmarks while maintaining efficient inference without substantial latency.

Conclusion: DynaAct provides an effective framework for automatically constructing compact action spaces that enhance sequential reasoning in complex problem-solving scenarios.

Abstract: In modern sequential decision-making systems, the construction of an optimal candidate action space is critical to efficient inference. However, existing approaches either rely on manually defined action spaces that lack scalability or utilize unstructured spaces that render exhaustive search computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named \textsc{DynaAct} for automatically constructing a compact action space to enhance sequential reasoning in complex problem-solving scenarios. Our method first estimates a proxy for the complete action space by extracting general sketches observed in a corpus covering diverse complex reasoning problems using large language models. We then formulate a submodular function that jointly evaluates candidate actions based on their utility to the current state and their diversity, and employ a greedy algorithm to select an optimal candidate set. Extensive experiments on six diverse standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves overall performance, while maintaining efficient inference without introducing substantial latency. The implementation is available at https://github.com/zhaoxlpku/DynaAct.

### [268] [Online Linear Regression with Paid Stochastic Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08073)
*Nadav Merlis,Kyoungseok Jang,Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online linear regression with noisy features where learner can pay to reduce noise. Optimal regret is √T when noise covariance known, T^{2/3} when unknown.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical scenarios where feature accuracy can be improved through payment (e.g., better equipment, privacy incentives), requiring analysis of trade-off between prediction error and payment costs.

Method: Matrix martingale concentration analysis to show uniform convergence of empirical loss to expected loss across all payments and linear predictors.

Result: Proved optimal regret rates: √T (ignoring logs) when noise covariance known, T^{2/3} when unknown.

Conclusion: The cost-benefit trade-off in feature quality improvement through payment can be optimally managed with provable regret bounds, with significant penalty when noise characteristics are unknown.

Abstract: We study an online linear regression setting in which the observed feature vectors are corrupted by noise and the learner can pay to reduce the noise level. In practice, this may happen for several reasons: for example, because features can be measured more accurately using more expensive equipment, or because data providers can be incentivized to release less private features. Assuming feature vectors are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed but unknown distribution, we measure the learner's regret against the linear predictor minimizing a notion of loss that combines the prediction error and payment. When the mapping between payments and noise covariance is known, we prove that the rate $\sqrt{T}$ is optimal for regret if logarithmic factors are ignored. When the noise covariance is unknown, we show that the optimal regret rate becomes of order $T^{2/3}$ (ignoring log factors). Our analysis leverages matrix martingale concentration, showing that the empirical loss uniformly converges to the expected one for all payments and linear predictors.

TL;DR: Proposes an Integrated Fusion Framework combining Gradient Boosting with Fuzzy Rule-Based Models to enhance performance while maintaining interpretability, using dynamic control factors and sample-based correction to prevent overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of individual learning paradigms by integrating fuzzy rule-based models' interpretability with gradient boosting's performance, addressing challenges like complex design specifications and scalability issues with large datasets.

Method: An ensemble framework where at each iteration, a Fuzzy Rule-Based Model is constructed and controlled by a dynamic factor that prevents model dominance, encourages diversity, acts as regularization, and allows dynamic tuning. Also includes sample-based correction mechanism for adaptive adjustments.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate performance enhancement, especially in mitigating overfitting and complexity associated with many rules, while maintaining interpretability and simplifying model maintenance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully merges strengths of both paradigms, improving performance through optimal factor control while preserving interpretability and enabling easier model updates.

Abstract: The integration of different learning paradigms has long been a focus of machine learning research, aimed at overcoming the inherent limitations of individual methods. Fuzzy rule-based models excel in interpretability and have seen widespread application across diverse fields. However, they face challenges such as complex design specifications and scalability issues with large datasets. The fusion of different techniques and strategies, particularly Gradient Boosting, with Fuzzy Rule-Based Models offers a robust solution to these challenges. This paper proposes an Integrated Fusion Framework that merges the strengths of both paradigms to enhance model performance and interpretability. At each iteration, a Fuzzy Rule-Based Model is constructed and controlled by a dynamic factor to optimize its contribution to the overall ensemble. This control factor serves multiple purposes: it prevents model dominance, encourages diversity, acts as a regularization parameter, and provides a mechanism for dynamic tuning based on model performance, thus mitigating the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the framework incorporates a sample-based correction mechanism that allows for adaptive adjustments based on feedback from a validation set. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of the presented gradient boosting framework for fuzzy rule-based models, demonstrating performance enhancement, especially in terms of mitigating overfitting and complexity typically associated with many rules. By leveraging an optimal factor to govern the contribution of each model, the framework improves performance, maintains interpretability, and simplifies the maintenance and update of the models.

TL;DR: HSPAG is a data-efficient framework for property-constrained molecular generation and editing that uses hierarchical structure-property alignment and reduces data requirements through scaffold clustering and hard sample selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current molecular generation faces challenges in capturing complex structure-property relationships and suffers from limited property annotations, which weakens model effectiveness.

Method: Treats SMILES and molecular properties as complementary modalities with hierarchical alignment at atom, substructure, and whole-molecule levels. Uses scaffold clustering for representative samples, auxiliary VAE for hard samples, property relevance-aware masking, and diversified perturbation strategies.

Result: HSPAG successfully captures fine-grained structure-property relationships and supports controllable generation under multiple property constraints. Real-world case studies validate its editing capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses data efficiency and annotation sparsity issues in molecular generation while maintaining strong performance in property-constrained generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: Property-constrained molecular generation and editing are crucial in AI-driven drug discovery but remain hindered by two factors: (i) capturing the complex relationships between molecular structures and multiple properties remains challenging, and (ii) the narrow coverage and incomplete annotations of molecular properties weaken the effectiveness of property-based models. To tackle these limitations, we propose HSPAG, a data-efficient framework featuring hierarchical structure-property alignment. By treating SMILES and molecular properties as complementary modalities, the model learns their relationships at atom, substructure, and whole-molecule levels. Moreover, we select representative samples through scaffold clustering and hard samples via an auxiliary variational auto-encoder (VAE), substantially reducing the required pre-training data. In addition, we incorporate a property relevance-aware masking mechanism and diversified perturbation strategies to enhance generation quality under sparse annotations. Experiments demonstrate that HSPAG captures fine-grained structure-property relationships and supports controllable generation under multiple property constraints. Two real-world case studies further validate the editing capabilities of HSPAG.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HipKittens (HK) is a programming framework that adapts tile-based abstractions from NVIDIA-focused DSLs to AMD GPUs, achieving performance competitive with hand-optimized assembly kernels for AI workloads like GEMMs and attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AMD GPUs offer high performance but require writing kernels in assembly for peak performance. Existing domain-specific languages like ThunderKittens are designed for NVIDIA hardware, creating a need for similar abstractions that work effectively on AMD platforms.

Method: Developed HipKittens (HK) framework with tile-based programming primitives optimized for AMD GPUs, rethinking the algorithms that instantiate these abstractions specifically for AMD's CDNA3 and CDNA4 architectures.

Result: HK kernels compete with AMD's hand-optimized assembly kernels for GEMMs and attention, outperform compiler baselines consistently, and in some cases outperform all available kernel baselines by 1.2-2.4× (e.g., d=64 attention, GQA backwards, memory-bound kernels).

Conclusion: Tile-based abstractions generalize to AMD GPUs but require algorithm rethinking. HK demonstrates the viability of a single, tile-based software layer for high-performance AI kernels across GPU vendors.

Abstract: AMD GPUs offer state-of-the-art compute and memory bandwidth; however, peak performance AMD kernels are written in raw assembly. To address the difficulty of mapping AI algorithms to hardware, recent work proposes C++ embedded and PyTorch-inspired domain-specific languages like ThunderKittens (TK) to simplify high performance AI kernel development on NVIDIA hardware. We explore the extent to which such primitives -- for explicit tile-based programming with optimized memory accesses and fine-grained asynchronous execution across workers -- are NVIDIA-specific or general. We provide the first detailed study of the programming primitives that lead to performant AMD AI kernels, and we encapsulate these insights in the HipKittens (HK) programming framework. We find that tile-based abstractions used in prior DSLs generalize to AMD GPUs, however we need to rethink the algorithms that instantiate these abstractions for AMD. We validate the HK primitives across CDNA3 and CDNA4 AMD platforms. In evaluations, HK kernels compete with AMD's hand-optimized assembly kernels for GEMMs and attention, and consistently outperform compiler baselines. Moreover, assembly is difficult to scale to the breadth of AI workloads; reflecting this, in some settings HK outperforms all available kernel baselines by $1.2-2.4\times$ (e.g., $d=64$ attention, GQA backwards, memory-bound kernels). These findings help pave the way for a single, tile-based software layer for high-performance AI kernels that translates across GPU vendors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analysis of ground-truth dynamics in robotic RL environments shows that global sparsity is rare, but local state-dependent sparsity exists in temporally localized clusters and affects specific state dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically examine assumptions about sparse causal graphs and temporal sparsity in learned dynamics models, determining if these sparsity priors actually hold in typical RL tasks.

Method: Analyzed ground-truth dynamics from robotic RL environments in MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, examining causal graph sparsity, state-dependent sparsity, and sparse local dynamics changes.

Result: Global sparsity is rare, but tasks show local state-dependent sparsity in dynamics that appears in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affects specific subsets of state dimensions.

Conclusion: Common sparsity prior assumptions in dynamics learning are challenged, emphasizing the need for grounded inductive biases that reflect the state-dependent sparsity structure of real-world dynamics.

Abstract: The use of learned dynamics models, also known as world models, can improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning. Recent work suggests that the underlying causal graphs of such dynamics models are sparsely connected, with each of the future state variables depending only on a small subset of the current state variables, and that learning may therefore benefit from sparsity priors. Similarly, temporal sparsity, i.e. sparsely and abruptly changing local dynamics, has also been proposed as a useful inductive bias.
  In this work, we critically examine these assumptions by analyzing ground-truth dynamics from a set of robotic reinforcement learning environments in the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, aiming to determine whether the proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity actually tend to hold in typical reinforcement learning tasks.
  We study (i) whether the causal graphs of environment dynamics are sparse, (ii) whether such sparsity is state-dependent, and (iii) whether local system dynamics change sparsely.
  Our results indicate that global sparsity is rare, but instead the tasks show local, state-dependent sparsity in their dynamics and this sparsity exhibits distinct structures, appearing in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affecting specific subsets of state dimensions. These findings challenge common sparsity prior assumptions in dynamics learning, emphasizing the need for grounded inductive biases that reflect the state-dependent sparsity structure of real-world dynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address oversmoothing and vanishing gradient problems in deep GNNs by leveraging Stuart-Landau oscillator dynamics, which provide richer behavior than phase-only models through amplitude regulation and multistable synchronization.

Method: Proposes Complex-Valued Stuart-Landau Graph Neural Network (SLGNN) that generalizes phase-centric Kuramoto-based OGNNs by allowing dynamic evolution of both node feature amplitudes and phases according to Stuart-Landau dynamics with tunable hyperparameters.

Result: SLGNN outperforms existing OGNNs across node classification, graph classification, and graph regression tasks, demonstrating superior performance and expressiveness.

Conclusion: SLGNN establishes a novel, expressive, and theoretically grounded framework for deep oscillatory architectures on graphs, providing additional control over feature amplitudes and network structure interactions.

Abstract: Oscillatory Graph Neural Networks (OGNNs) are an emerging class of physics-inspired architectures designed to mitigate oversmoothing and vanishing gradient problems in deep GNNs. In this work, we introduce the Complex-Valued Stuart-Landau Graph Neural Network (SLGNN), a novel architecture grounded in Stuart-Landau oscillator dynamics. Stuart-Landau oscillators are canonical models of limit-cycle behavior near Hopf bifurcations, which are fundamental to synchronization theory and are widely used in e.g. neuroscience for mesoscopic brain modeling. Unlike harmonic oscillators and phase-only Kuramoto models, Stuart-Landau oscillators retain both amplitude and phase dynamics, enabling rich phenomena such as amplitude regulation and multistable synchronization. The proposed SLGNN generalizes existing phase-centric Kuramoto-based OGNNs by allowing node feature amplitudes to evolve dynamically according to Stuart-Landau dynamics, with explicit tunable hyperparameters (such as the Hopf-parameter and the coupling strength) providing additional control over the interplay between feature amplitudes and network structure. We conduct extensive experiments across node classification, graph classification, and graph regression tasks, demonstrating that SLGNN outperforms existing OGNNs and establishes a novel, expressive, and theoretically grounded framework for deep oscillatory architectures on graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing regulatory and reporting practices lack standardized, model-agnostic evaluation protocols for AI sustainability, with current assessments focusing only on short-term resource usage and batch learning settings.

Method: Developed a comprehensive evaluation protocol applicable to both batch and streaming learning scenarios, tested through experiments on diverse classification tasks using various model types.

Result: Traditional static train-test evaluations do not reliably capture sustainability under evolving data and repeated model updates; long-term sustainability varies significantly across models, with higher environmental cost often yielding little performance benefit.

Conclusion: A standardized protocol for long-term sustainability assessment is needed, as current evaluation methods fail to reflect real-world AI lifecycles and environmental costs.

Abstract: Sustainability and efficiency have become essential considerations in the development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence systems, yet existing regulatory and reporting practices lack standardized, model-agnostic evaluation protocols. Current assessments often measure only short-term experimental resource usage and disproportionately emphasize batch learning settings, failing to reflect real-world, long-term AI lifecycles. In this work, we propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol for assessing the long-term sustainability of ML models, applicable to both batch and streaming learning scenarios. Through experiments on diverse classification tasks using a range of model types, we demonstrate that traditional static train-test evaluations do not reliably capture sustainability under evolving data and repeated model updates. Our results show that long-term sustainability varies significantly across models, and in many cases, higher environmental cost yields little performance benefit.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SafeMIL uses multiple instance learning to learn a cost function from non-preferred trajectories, enabling safe offline imitation learning that avoids risky behaviors while maintaining reward performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online interactions can be risky in real-world settings, and specifying exact reward/cost functions is difficult. However, collecting trajectories showing undesirable behavior is often feasible, providing implicit safety information.

Method: Proposes SafeMIL approach that learns a parameterized cost function via Multiple Instance Learning to predict risky state-action pairs from non-preferred trajectories, then uses this cost to avoid unsafe behaviors.

Result: Empirical results show SafeMIL learns safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading reward performance, outperforming several baseline methods.

Conclusion: SafeMIL effectively leverages non-preferred trajectories for offline safe imitation learning, enabling agents to avoid risky behaviors while maintaining good performance, addressing the challenge of safety in imitation learning without online interaction risks.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of offline safe imitation learning (IL). In many real-world settings, online interactions can be risky, and accurately specifying the reward and the safety cost information at each timestep can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories reflecting undesirable or risky behavior, implicitly conveying the behavior the agent should avoid. We refer to these trajectories as non-preferred trajectories. Unlike standard IL, which aims to mimic demonstrations, our agent must also learn to avoid risky behavior using non-preferred trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, SafeMIL, to learn a parameterized cost that predicts if the state-action pair is risky via \textit{Multiple Instance Learning}. The learned cost is then used to avoid non-preferred behaviors, resulting in a policy that prioritizes safety. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn a safer policy that satisfies cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thereby outperforming several baselines.

TL;DR: BIPPO is an energy-efficient multi-agent RL solution for client selection in Federated Learning that improves performance while consuming minimal budget, even with increasing clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning lacks infrastructure efficiency considerations for resource-constrained IoT environments, and existing RL approaches don't address practical challenges like generalizability and energy efficiency.

Method: Proposed BIPPO (Budget-aware Independent Proximal Policy Optimization), an energy-efficient multi-agent RL solution with improved sampler for client selection in FL.

Result: BIPPO increased mean accuracy compared to non-RL mechanisms, traditional PPO, and IPPO in image classification tasks with non-IID data, while consuming negligible budget that remains consistent with more clients.

Conclusion: BIPPO provides a performant, stable, scalable, and sustainable solution for client selection in IoT-FL systems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising machine learning solution in large-scale IoT systems, guaranteeing load distribution and privacy. However, FL does not natively consider infrastructure efficiency, a critical concern for systems operating in resource-constrained environments. Several Reinforcement Learning (RL) based solutions offer improved client selection for FL; however, they do not consider infrastructure challenges, such as resource limitations and device churn. Furthermore, the training of RL methods is often not designed for practical application, as these approaches frequently do not consider generalizability and are not optimized for energy efficiency. To fill this gap, we propose BIPPO (Budget-aware Independent Proximal Policy Optimization), which is an energy-efficient multi-agent RL solution that improves performance. We evaluate BIPPO on two image classification tasks run in a highly budget-constrained setting, with FL clients training on non-IID data, a challenging context for vanilla FL. The improved sampler of BIPPO enables it to increase the mean accuracy compared to non-RL mechanisms, traditional PPO, and IPPO. In addition, BIPPO only consumes a negligible proportion of the budget, which stays consistent even if the number of clients increases. Overall, BIPPO delivers a performant, stable, scalable, and sustainable solution for client selection in IoT-FL.

Abstract: Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) is a family of algorithms for effectively solving imperfect-information games. To enhance CFR's applicability in large games, researchers use neural networks to approximate its behavior. However, existing methods are mainly based on vanilla CFR and struggle to effectively integrate more advanced CFR variants. In this work, we propose an efficient model-free neural CFR algorithm, overcoming the limitations of existing methods in approximating advanced CFR variants. At each iteration, it collects variance-reduced sampled advantages based on a value network, fits cumulative advantages by bootstrapping, and applies discounting and clipping operations to simulate the update mechanisms of advanced CFR variants. Experimental results show that, compared with model-free neural algorithms, it exhibits faster convergence in typical imperfect-information games and demonstrates stronger adversarial performance in a large poker game.

Conclusion: The proposed IGNS framework effectively addresses limitations of existing neural simulators by preserving information and handling broader classes of dynamics, demonstrating superior performance on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Learning to simulate complex physical systems from data has emerged as a promising way to overcome the limitations of traditional numerical solvers, which often require prohibitive computational costs for high-fidelity solutions. Recent Graph Neural Simulators (GNSs) accelerate simulations by learning dynamics on graph-structured data, yet often struggle to capture long-range interactions and suffer from error accumulation under autoregressive rollouts. To address these challenges, we propose Information-preserving Graph Neural Simulators (IGNS), a graph-based neural simulator built on the principles of Hamiltonian dynamics. This structure guarantees preservation of information across the graph, while extending to port-Hamiltonian systems allows the model to capture a broader class of dynamics, including non-conservative effects. IGNS further incorporates a warmup phase to initialize global context, geometric encoding to handle irregular meshes, and a multi-step training objective to reduce rollout error. To evaluate these properties systematically, we introduce new benchmarks that target long-range dependencies and challenging external forcing scenarios. Across all tasks, IGNS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNSs, achieving higher accuracy and stability under challenging and complex dynamical systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that most continual learning methods are not truly agnostic as they rely on a priori information about future data. It introduces OPRE, an online dataset compression method that achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR datasets with minimal assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning while maintaining true agnosticism - most current methods rely on pretrained feature extractors or other a priori information about future data, which limits their generality.

Method: Proposes Online Patch Redundancy Eliminator (OPRE), an online dataset compression algorithm that works alongside classifier training at test time. It requires only minimal and interpretable hypotheses about future data.

Result: OPRE achieves superior performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 compared to other state-of-the-art online continual learning methods.

Conclusion: Online dataset compression may be necessary for achieving fully agnostic continual learning, and OPRE demonstrates this approach with strong empirical results while maintaining minimal assumptions about data.

Abstract: In order to achieve Continual Learning (CL), the problem of catastrophic forgetting, one that has plagued neural networks since their inception, must be overcome. The evaluation of continual learning methods relies on splitting a known homogeneous dataset and learning the associated tasks one after the other. We argue that most CL methods introduce a priori information about the data to come and cannot be considered agnostic. We exemplify this point with the case of methods relying on pretrained feature extractors, which are still used in CL. After showing that pretrained feature extractors imply a loss of generality with respect to the data that can be learned by the model, we then discuss other kinds of a priori information introduced in other CL methods. We then present the Online Patch Redundancy Eliminator (OPRE), an online dataset compression algorithm, which, along with the training of a classifier at test time, yields performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 superior to a number of other state-of-the-art online continual learning methods. Additionally, OPRE requires only minimal and interpretable hypothesis on the data to come. We suggest that online dataset compression could well be necessary to achieve fully agnostic CL.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity including temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability, which pose significant challenges for long-term forecasting accuracy.

Method: Dual-branch framework with Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module using non-stationary mix of experts filter for temporal domain, and Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module using frequency differencing for frequency domain, with fusion of both outputs.

Result: Extensive experiments show DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

Conclusion: DTAF effectively addresses non-stationarity in both temporal and frequency domains, generating robust forecasts that adapt to distribution shifts and spectral variability.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical for decision-making across dynamic domains such as energy, finance, transportation, and cloud computing. However, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity, including temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability, which pose significant challenges for long-term time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose DTAF, a dual-branch framework that addresses non-stationarity in both the temporal and frequency domains. For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies. For the frequency domain, the Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module applies frequency differencing to dynamically highlight components with significant spectral shifts. By fusing the complementary outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF generates robust forecasts that adapt to both temporal and frequency domain non-stationarity. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

Result: Significant performance improvements: +321% on HalfCheetah-v4, +69% on Ant-v4, +276% on LunarLander-v2, with enhanced training stability and sample efficiency across continuous and discrete action spaces.

Conclusion: Learning where to explore through advantage-guided preferences is crucial for RL performance, and PrefPoE provides a general framework to enhance policy gradient methods across all RL domains.

Abstract: Exploration in reinforcement learning remains a critical challenge, as naive entropy maximization often results in high variance and inefficient policy updates. We introduce \textbf{PrefPoE}, a novel \textit{Preference-Product-of-Experts} framework that performs intelligent, advantage-guided exploration via the first principled application of product-of-experts (PoE) fusion for single-task exploration-exploitation balancing. By training a preference network to concentrate probability mass on high-advantage actions and fusing it with the main policy through PoE, PrefPoE creates a \textbf{soft trust region} that stabilizes policy updates while maintaining targeted exploration. Across diverse control tasks spanning both continuous and discrete action spaces, PrefPoE demonstrates consistent improvements: +321\% on HalfCheetah-v4 (1276~$\rightarrow$~5375), +69\% on Ant-v4, +276\% on LunarLander-v2, with consistently enhanced training stability and sample efficiency. Unlike standard PPO, which suffers from entropy collapse, PrefPoE sustains adaptive exploration through its unique dynamics, thereby preventing premature convergence and enabling superior performance. Our results establish that learning \textit{where to explore} through advantage-guided preferences is as crucial as learning how to act, offering a general framework for enhancing policy gradient methods across the full spectrum of reinforcement learning domains. Code and pretrained models are available in supplementary materials.

TL;DR: The paper provides a unified theoretical framework for Transformers by mapping discrete positions to continuous manifolds and interpreting Transformer layers as kernel-modulated operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers have achieved great success but lack a unified physical/mathematical interpretation of their core components (positional encoding and attention mechanisms).

Method: Proposes a structural theoretical framework that integrates positional encoding, kernel integral operators, and attention mechanisms, mapping discrete positions to spatial functions on continuous manifolds.

Result: Enables a field-theoretic interpretation of Transformer layers as kernel-modulated operators acting over embedded manifolds.

Conclusion: The framework provides a unified mathematical foundation for understanding Transformer architecture components through continuous manifold theory.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has achieved tremendous success in natural language processing, computer vision, and scientific computing through its self-attention mechanism. However, its core components-positional encoding and attention mechanisms-have lacked a unified physical or mathematical interpretation. This paper proposes a structural theoretical framework that integrates positional encoding, kernel integral operators, and attention mechanisms for in-depth theoretical investigation. We map discrete positions (such as text token indices and image pixel coordinates) to spatial functions on continuous manifolds, enabling a field-theoretic interpretation of Transformer layers as kernel-modulated operators acting over embedded manifolds.

*Fedor Sergeev,Manuel Burger,Polina Leshetkina,Vincent Fortuin,Gunnar Rätsch,Rita Kuznetsova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a method to automatically learn feature groups from clinical time series data by clustering weights of feature-wise embedding layers, improving predictive performance without requiring expert-defined groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical time series data are multivariate with heterogeneous features, and grouping features based on similarity enhances deep learning performance, but defining groups manually is challenging for domain experts.

Method: Learns feature groups by clustering weights of feature-wise embedding layers during standard supervised training, discovering groups that directly improve downstream performance.

Result: Outperforms static clustering on synthetic data and achieves comparable performance to expert-defined groups on real-world medical data, with learned groups being clinically interpretable.

Conclusion: The method enables data-driven discovery of task-relevant relationships between clinical variables and provides interpretable feature groupings that enhance predictive modeling.

Abstract: Clinical time series data are critical for patient monitoring and predictive modeling. These time series are typically multivariate and often comprise hundreds of heterogeneous features from different data sources. The grouping of features based on similarity and relevance to the prediction task has been shown to enhance the performance of deep learning architectures. However, defining these groups a priori using only semantic knowledge is challenging, even for domain experts. To address this, we propose a novel method that learns feature groups by clustering weights of feature-wise embedding layers. This approach seamlessly integrates into standard supervised training and discovers the groups that directly improve downstream performance on clinically relevant tasks. We demonstrate that our method outperforms static clustering approaches on synthetic data and achieves performance comparable to expert-defined groups on real-world medical data. Moreover, the learned feature groups are clinically interpretable, enabling data-driven discovery of task-relevant relationships between variables.

### [284] [Rethinking Explanation Evaluation under the Retraining Scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08281)
*Yi Cai,Thibaud Ardoin,Mayank Gulati,Gerhard Wunder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies and resolves the "sign issue" in retraining-based explanation evaluation methods like ROAR, which causes misalignment between empirical results and theoretical expectations. The authors propose reframed evaluation variants that improve efficiency and provide more reliable explainer benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explanation evaluation methods face challenges: inference-based methods suffer from distribution shift issues, while retraining-based methods like ROAR produce results that contradict theoretical foundations of explainers. There's a need to understand and resolve this misalignment.

Method: The authors identify the "sign issue" as the key problem in retraining-based evaluation and propose a straightforward reframing of the evaluation process to resolve it. They develop novel variants of the evaluation framework that jointly structure a comprehensive perspective on explanation evaluation.

Result: The proposed evaluation variants significantly improve evaluation efficiency over standard retraining protocols. Empirical results across various data scales provide deeper insights into explainer performance and reveal open challenges in explainability research.

Conclusion: The identified sign issue was responsible for distorting retraining-based evaluation, and the proposed reframing effectively resolves this problem. The new evaluation variants enhance practical applicability for explainer selection and benchmarking while providing more reliable assessment of explanation quality.

Abstract: Feature attribution has gained prominence as a tool for explaining model decisions, yet evaluating explanation quality remains challenging due to the absence of ground-truth explanations. To circumvent this, explanation-guided input manipulation has emerged as an indirect evaluation strategy, measuring explanation effectiveness through the impact of input modifications on model outcomes during inference. Despite the widespread use, a major concern with inference-based schemes is the distribution shift caused by such manipulations, which undermines the reliability of their assessments. The retraining-based scheme ROAR overcomes this issue by adapting the model to the altered data distribution. However, its evaluation results often contradict the theoretical foundations of widely accepted explainers. This work investigates this misalignment between empirical observations and theoretical expectations. In particular, we identify the sign issue as a key factor responsible for residual information that ultimately distorts retraining-based evaluation. Based on the analysis, we show that a straightforward reframing of the evaluation process can effectively resolve the identified issue. Building on the existing framework, we further propose novel variants that jointly structure a comprehensive perspective on explanation evaluation. These variants largely improve evaluation efficiency over the standard retraining protocol, thereby enhancing practical applicability for explainer selection and benchmarking. Following our proposed schemes, empirical results across various data scales provide deeper insights into the performance of carefully selected explainers, revealing open challenges and future directions in explainability research.

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient Graph Contrastive Learning framework that transforms graphs into compact node set networks with linear complexity contrastive loss and knowledge distillation for scalable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability issues in Graph Contrastive Learning caused by intensive GNN message passing and quadratic computational complexity of contrastive loss on large-scale graphs.

Method: Transforms input graph into compact network of interconnected node sets, introduces kernelized graph community contrastive loss with linear complexity, and incorporates knowledge distillation into decoupled GNN architecture.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines on sixteen real-world datasets of varying scales in both effectiveness and scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses scalability challenges in GCL while maintaining strong performance through efficient graph transformation and linear complexity contrastive learning.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the absence of task-specific labels. However, its scalability on large-scale graphs is hindered by the intensive message passing mechanism of GNN and the quadratic computational complexity of contrastive loss over positive and negative node pairs. To address these issues, we propose an efficient GCL framework that transforms the input graph into a compact network of interconnected node sets while preserving structural information across communities. We firstly introduce a kernelized graph community contrastive loss with linear complexity, enabling effective information transfer among node sets to capture hierarchical structural information of the graph. We then incorporate a knowledge distillation technique into the decoupled GNN architecture to accelerate inference while maintaining strong generalization performance. Extensive experiments on sixteen real-world datasets of varying scales demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines in both effectiveness and scalability.

### [286] [Test-time Diverse Reasoning by Riemannian Activation Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08305)
*Ly Tran Ho Khanh,Dongxuan Zhu,Man-Chung Yue,Viet Anh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes test-time Riemannian activation steering to increase output diversity in Best-of-N reasoning by optimizing steering vectors that maximize reasoning path variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the output diversity limit in Best-of-N reasoning where models generate similar outputs despite stochastic sampling, leading to repeated errors.

Method: Unsupervised activation steering that finds steering vectors maximizing volume spanned by intervened activation subsets via Riemannian optimization with log-determinant objective, using block-coordinate descent.

Result: Empirical evaluations show improved generative diversity and solution accuracy on mathematical benchmarks compared to vanilla sampling.

Conclusion: Test-time Riemannian activation steering effectively enhances output diversity and accuracy in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Best-of-$N$ reasoning improves the accuracy of language models in solving complex tasks by sampling multiple candidate solutions and then selecting the best one based on some criteria. A critical bottleneck for this strategy is the output diversity limit, which occurs when the model generates similar outputs despite stochastic sampling, and hence recites the same error. To address this lack of variance in reasoning paths, we propose a novel unsupervised activation steering strategy that simultaneously optimizes the steering vectors for multiple reasoning trajectories at test time. At any synchronization anchor along the batch generation process, we find the steering vectors that maximize the total volume spanned by all possible intervened activation subsets. We demonstrate that these steering vectors can be determined by solving a Riemannian optimization problem over the product of spheres with a log-determinant objective function. We then use a Riemannian block-coordinate descent algorithm with a well-tuned learning rate to obtain a stationary point of the problem, and we apply these steering vectors until the generation process reaches the subsequent synchronization anchor. Empirical evaluations on popular mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our test-time Riemannian activation steering strategy outperforms vanilla sampling techniques in terms of generative diversity and solution accuracy.

### [287] [Improving the accuracy and generalizability of molecular property regression models with a substructure-substitution-rule-informed framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08314)
*Xiaoyu Fan,Lin Guo,Ruizhen Jia,Yang Tian,Zhihao Yang,Boxue Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolRuleLoss is a substructure-substitution-rule-informed framework that improves accuracy and generalizability of molecular property regression models by incorporating partial derivative constraints for substructure substitution rules into the loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models for molecular property prediction often exhibit poor accuracy in regression tasks and perform catastrophically poorly for out-of-distribution molecules, limiting their practical application in drug discovery.

Method: MolRuleLoss incorporates partial derivative constraints for substructure substitution rules (SSRs) into molecular property regression models' loss functions, using both the number and quality of SSRs to improve predictions.

Result: Significant performance improvements across multiple tasks: lipophilicity (11% RMSE reduction), water solubility (2.6% reduction), solvation-free energy (33.3% reduction), and dramatic improvement for OOD molecular weight prediction (RMSE from 29.507 to 0.007).

Conclusion: MolRuleLoss framework effectively boosts prediction accuracy and generalizability of multiple molecular property regression models, supporting diverse applications in cheminformatics and AI-aided drug discovery.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided drug discovery is an active research field, yet AI models often exhibit poor accuracy in regression tasks for molecular property prediction, and perform catastrophically poorly for out-of-distribution (OOD) molecules. Here, we present MolRuleLoss, a substructure-substitution-rule-informed framework that improves the accuracy and generalizability of multiple molecular property regression models (MPRMs) such as GEM and UniMol for diverse molecular property prediction tasks. MolRuleLoss incorporates partial derivative constraints for substructure substitution rules (SSRs) into an MPRM's loss function. When using GEM models for predicting lipophilicity, water solubility, and solvation-free energy (using lipophilicity, ESOL, and freeSolv datasets from MoleculeNet), the root mean squared error (RMSE) values with and without MolRuleLoss were 0.587 vs. 0.660, 0.777 vs. 0.798, and 1.252 vs. 1.877, respectively, representing 2.6-33.3% performance improvements. We show that both the number and the quality of SSRs contribute to the magnitude of prediction accuracy gains obtained upon adding MolRuleLoss to an MPRM. MolRuleLoss improved the generalizability of MPRMs for "activity cliff" molecules in a lipophilicity prediction task and improved the generalizability of MPRMs for OOD molecules in a melting point prediction task. In a molecular weight prediction task for OOD molecules, MolRuleLoss reduced the RMSE value of a GEM model from 29.507 to 0.007. We also provide a formal demonstration that the upper bound of the variation for property change of SSRs is positively correlated with an MPRM's error. Together, we show that using the MolRuleLoss framework as a bolt-on boosts the prediction accuracy and generalizability of multiple MPRMs, supporting diverse applications in areas like cheminformatics and AI-aided drug discovery.

*Eunice Chan,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates how adversarial poisoning attacks can intentionally compromise fairness in machine learning systems, specifically targeting naive Bayes classifiers to induce maximally unfair behavior while preserving overall accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With growing AI adoption in real-world applications, there's little research on fairness vulnerability - how AI systems' fairness can be intentionally compromised, unlike the extensive work on assessing and improving fairness.

Method: Strategic injection of a small fraction of carefully crafted adversarial data points into training sets to bias the model's decision boundary, disproportionately affecting protected groups while maintaining generalizable performance.

Result: The attack significantly outperforms existing methods in degrading fairness metrics across multiple models and datasets, achieving substantially higher unfairness levels with comparable or slightly worse accuracy impact. Effective across a wide range of models.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a robust and potent approach to compromising machine learning fairness, demonstrating serious vulnerability in AI systems that requires attention for real-world deployment security.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of AI and machine learning systems in real-world applications, ensuring their fairness has become increasingly critical. The majority of the work in algorithmic fairness focus on assessing and improving the fairness of machine learning systems. There is relatively little research on fairness vulnerability, i.e., how an AI system's fairness can be intentionally compromised. In this work, we first provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a simple adversarial poisoning strategy is sufficient to induce maximally unfair behavior in naive Bayes classifiers. Our key idea is to strategically inject a small fraction of carefully crafted adversarial data points into the training set, biasing the model's decision boundary to disproportionately affect a protected group while preserving generalizable performance. To illustrate the practical effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments across several benchmark datasets and models. We find that our attack significantly outperforms existing methods in degrading fairness metrics across multiple models and datasets, often achieving substantially higher levels of unfairness with a comparable or only slightly worse impact on accuracy. Notably, our method proves effective on a wide range of models, in contrast to prior work, demonstrating a robust and potent approach to compromising the fairness of machine learning systems.

*Ruiyu Qiu,Rui Wang,Guanghui Yang,Xiang Li,Zhijiang Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes LPPG-RL, a novel lexicographic multi-objective RL framework using sequential gradient projections for continuous spaces, overcoming limitations of existing methods that require heuristic tuning or are restricted to discrete domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Safe RL and Multi-Objective RL methods struggle to efficiently enforce priority orderings in lexicographic multi-objective problems, which are common in real-world applications with multiple conflicting subtasks and explicit priorities.

Method: LPPG-RL uses sequential gradient projections to identify feasible policy update directions, reformulates projection as optimization using Dykstra's projection for speed, and introduces Subproblem Exploration to prevent gradient vanishing and enhance stability.

Result: Extensive experiments in 2D navigation environment demonstrate LPPG-RL outperforms existing state-of-the-art continuous LMORL methods, with theoretical guarantees for convergence and established lower bound on policy improvement.

Conclusion: LPPG-RL provides an effective framework for lexicographic multi-objective RL in continuous spaces, broadly compatible with all policy gradient algorithms and delivering superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Lexicographic multi-objective problems, which consist of multiple conflicting subtasks with explicit priorities, are common in real-world applications. Despite the advantages of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in single tasks, extending conventional RL methods to prioritized multiple objectives remains challenging. In particular, traditional Safe RL and Multi-Objective RL (MORL) methods have difficulty enforcing priority orderings efficiently. Therefore, Lexicographic Multi-Objective RL (LMORL) methods have been developed to address these challenges. However, existing LMORL methods either rely on heuristic threshold tuning with prior knowledge or are restricted to discrete domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lexicographically Projected Policy Gradient RL (LPPG-RL), a novel LMORL framework which leverages sequential gradient projections to identify feasible policy update directions, thereby enabling LPPG-RL broadly compatible with all policy gradient algorithms in continuous spaces. LPPG-RL reformulates the projection step as an optimization problem, and utilizes Dykstra's projection rather than generic solvers to deliver great speedups, especially for small- to medium-scale instances. In addition, LPPG-RL introduces Subproblem Exploration (SE) to prevent gradient vanishing, accelerate convergence and enhance stability. We provide theoretical guarantees for convergence and establish a lower bound on policy improvement. Finally, through extensive experiments in a 2D navigation environment, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LPPG-RL, showing that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art continuous LMORL methods.

TL;DR: HN-MVTS integrates hypernetwork-based generative prior with neural forecasting models to improve multivariate time series forecasting by generating weights for the last layer as a data-adaptive regularizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in complex channel-dependent models compared to robust channel-independent models, while handling complex temporal dependencies in multivariate time series.

Method: Uses hypernetwork with learnable embedding matrix of time series components to generate weights for the last layer of target forecasting networks, serving as data-adaptive regularizer. Hypernetwork is only used during training.

Result: Extensive experiments on 8 benchmark datasets show HN-MVTS improves performance of state-of-the-art models (DLinear, PatchTST, TSMixer, etc.) without increasing inference time.

Conclusion: Hypernetwork-driven parameterization offers promising direction for enhancing existing forecasting techniques in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of multivariate time series data remains a formidable challenge, particularly due to the growing complexity of temporal dependencies in real-world scenarios. While neural network-based models have achieved notable success in this domain, complex channel-dependent models often suffer from performance degradation compared to channel-independent models that do not consider the relationship between components but provide high robustness due to small capacity. In this work, we propose HN-MVTS, a novel architecture that integrates a hypernetwork-based generative prior with an arbitrary neural network forecasting model. The input of this hypernetwork is a learnable embedding matrix of time series components. To restrict the number of new parameters, the hypernetwork learns to generate the weights of the last layer of the target forecasting networks, serving as a data-adaptive regularizer that improves generalization and long-range predictive accuracy. The hypernetwork is used only during the training, so it does not increase the inference time compared to the base forecasting model. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that application of HN-MVTS to the state-of-the-art models (DLinear, PatchTST, TSMixer, etc.) typically improves their performance. Our findings suggest that hypernetwork-driven parameterization offers a promising direction for enhancing existing forecasting techniques in complex scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The opacity of neural networks in high-stakes domains requires explainable AI, but there's a critical gap in standardized benchmarks for prototype-based XAI methods, particularly for time series data, leading to subjective evaluations.

Method: Developed ProtoScore framework that integrates Co-12 properties from Nauta et al. to assess prototype-based XAI methods across different data types with focus on time series.

Result: Created a robust framework that enables fair and comprehensive evaluation of prototype methods against each other and other XAI approaches, helping practitioners select appropriate methods without costly user studies.

Conclusion: ProtoScore provides an objective benchmarking system for prototype-based XAI methods, advancing the field by enabling standardized comparisons and reducing reliance on subjective evaluations.

Abstract: The complexity and opacity of neural networks (NNs) pose significant challenges, particularly in high-stakes fields such as healthcare, finance, and law, where understanding decision-making processes is crucial. To address these issues, the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has developed various methods aimed at clarifying AI decision-making, thereby facilitating appropriate trust and validating the fairness of outcomes. Among these methods, prototype-based explanations offer a promising approach that uses representative examples to elucidate model behavior. However, a critical gap exists regarding standardized benchmarks to objectively compare prototype-based XAI methods, especially in the context of time series data. This lack of reliable benchmarks results in subjective evaluations, hindering progress in the field. We aim to establish a robust framework, ProtoScore, for assessing prototype-based XAI methods across different data types with a focus on time series data, facilitating fair and comprehensive evaluations. By integrating the Co-12 properties of Nauta et al., this framework allows for effectively comparing prototype methods against each other and against other XAI methods, ultimately assisting practitioners in selecting appropriate explanation methods while minimizing the costs associated with user studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HPO algorithms cannot leverage experts' prior knowledge about hyperparameter settings, especially for multiple objectives, creating a gap in the algorithmic landscape for DL practitioners who need to optimize multiple objectives.

Method: Introduces PriMO, a hyperparameter optimization algorithm designed to integrate multi-objective user beliefs and prior knowledge about hyperparameter settings.

Result: PriMO achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 deep learning benchmarks, performing well in both multi-objective and single-objective optimization scenarios.

Conclusion: PriMO positions itself as the new go-to HPO algorithm for deep learning practitioners, effectively addressing the limitation of incorporating multi-objective prior knowledge in hyperparameter optimization.

Abstract: While Deep Learning (DL) experts often have prior knowledge about which hyperparameter settings yield strong performance, only few Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms can leverage such prior knowledge and none incorporate priors over multiple objectives. As DL practitioners often need to optimize not just one but many objectives, this is a blind spot in the algorithmic landscape of HPO. To address this shortcoming, we introduce PriMO, the first HPO algorithm that can integrate multi-objective user beliefs. We show PriMO achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 DL benchmarks in the multi-objective and single-objective setting, clearly positioning itself as the new go-to HPO algorithm for DL practitioners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer architectures for multivariate time series forecasting lag behind MLP-based models due to unstable inter-channel relationships, creating a performance gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: Proposes EMAformer which enhances Transformer with an auxiliary embedding suite introducing three inductive biases: global stability, phase sensitivity, and cross-axis specificity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 12 real-world benchmarks, reducing forecasting errors by average 2.73% in MSE and 5.15% in MAE.

Conclusion: EMAformer significantly advances practical applicability of Transformer-based approaches for multivariate time series forecasting by unlocking further potential of the architecture.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is crucial across a wide range of domains. While presenting notable progress for the Transformer architecture, iTransformer still lags behind the latest MLP-based models. We attribute this performance gap to unstable inter-channel relationships. To bridge this gap, we propose EMAformer, a simple yet effective model that enhances the Transformer with an auxiliary embedding suite, akin to armor that reinforces its ability. By introducing three key inductive biases, i.e., \textit{global stability}, \textit{phase sensitivity}, and \textit{cross-axis specificity}, EMAformer unlocks the further potential of the Transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 12 real-world benchmarks and reducing forecasting errors by an average of 2.73\% in MSE and 5.15\% in MAE. This significantly advances the practical applicability of Transformer-based approaches for multivariate time series forecasting. The code is available on https://github.com/PlanckChang/EMAformer.

TL;DR: BACL improves multimodal models by focusing on ambiguous negative pairs that differ only slightly from positives, using a curriculum learning approach with local attention to boost performance without extra labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models treat all negative pairs equally, failing to distinguish ambiguous negatives that are very similar to positives but differ in small details, which limits learning effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Boundary-Aware Curriculum with Local Attention (BACL) with two modules: Boundary-aware Negative Sampler that gradually increases difficulty, and Contrastive Local Attention loss that highlights mismatch locations. Both are differentiable and work with any dual encoder.

Result: Theoretical analysis predicts O(1/n) error rate. Experimental results show up to +32% R@1 improvement over CLIP and achieve new state-of-the-art on four large-scale benchmarks without requiring additional labels.

Conclusion: BACL effectively leverages ambiguous negative pairs through curriculum learning and local attention, significantly improving multimodal representation learning while being lightweight and compatible with existing dual encoder architectures.

Abstract: Most multimodal models treat every negative pair alike, ignoring the ambiguous negatives that differ from the positive by only a small detail. We propose Boundary-Aware Curriculum with Local Attention (BACL), a lightweight add-on that turns these borderline cases into a curriculum signal. A Boundary-aware Negative Sampler gradually raises difficulty, while a Contrastive Local Attention loss highlights where the mismatch occurs. The two modules are fully differentiable and work with any off-the-shelf dual encoder. Theory predicts a fast O(1/n) error rate; practice shows up to +32% R@1 over CLIP and new SOTA on four large-scale benchmarks, all without extra labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse rewards in graph-structured MARL adversarial tasks hinder efficient policy learning, requiring better coordination mechanisms for dynamic agent interactions.

Method: Combines attention-based graph neural networks for modeling agent dependencies with adaptive divergence regularization that gradually reduces reliance on reference policies.

Result: ARAC achieves faster convergence, higher success rates, and stronger scalability across varying agent numbers in pursuit and confrontation scenarios compared to MARL baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles complex graph-structured environments by balancing exploration guidance with policy independence.

Abstract: In graph-structured multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) adversarial tasks such as pursuit and confrontation, agents must coordinate under highly dynamic interactions, where sparse rewards hinder efficient policy learning. We propose Adaptive Regularized Multi-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (ARAC), which integrates an attention-based graph neural network (GNN) for modeling agent dependencies with an adaptive divergence regularization mechanism. The GNN enables expressive representation of spatial relations and state features in graph environments. Divergence regularization can serve as policy guidance to alleviate the sparse reward problem, but it may lead to suboptimal convergence when the reference policy itself is imperfect. The adaptive divergence regularization mechanism enables the framework to exploit reference policies for efficient exploration in the early stages, while gradually reducing reliance on them as training progresses to avoid inheriting their limitations. Experiments in pursuit and confrontation scenarios demonstrate that ARAC achieves faster convergence, higher final success rates, and stronger scalability across varying numbers of agents compared with MARL baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in complex graph-structured environments.

*Xiyuan Wei,Chih-Jen Lin,Tianbao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuCLIP is a novel optimization framework that reformulates CLIP contrastive loss using convex and variational analysis to estimate normalization terms more accurately, enabling efficient training with small batches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP training methods require large batches for accurate normalization term estimation, demanding high computational resources. Per-sample estimators have optimization errors that scale with dataset-to-batch size ratio, limiting effectiveness for large datasets or small batches.

Method: Reformulates contrastive loss via convex analysis into minimization with auxiliary log-normalizer variables, then transforms this into minimizing a compact neural network that predicts log-normalizers. Uses alternating optimization to jointly train CLIP model and auxiliary network with tailored architecture and acceleration techniques.

Result: Achieves more accurate normalizer estimation and improved performance compared to previous methods. Extensive experiments on datasets from millions to billions of samples demonstrate NeuCLIP outperforms existing approaches.

Conclusion: NeuCLIP provides an elegant optimization framework that overcomes limitations of batch-dependent normalization estimation in CLIP training, enabling efficient training with small batches while maintaining high performance across large-scale datasets.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the normalization term (also known as the partition function) in the contrastive loss is a central challenge for training Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models. Conventional methods rely on large batches for approximation, demanding substantial computational resources. To mitigate this issue, prior works introduced per-sample normalizer estimators, which are updated at each epoch in a blockwise coordinate manner to keep track of updated encoders. However, this scheme incurs optimization error that scales with the ratio of dataset size to batch size, limiting effectiveness for large datasets or small batches. To overcome this limitation, we propose NeuCLIP, a novel and elegant optimization framework based on two key ideas: (i) $\textbf{reformulating}$ the contrastive loss for each sample $\textbf{via convex analysis}$ into a minimization problem with an auxiliary variable representing its log-normalizer; and (ii) $\textbf{transforming}$ the resulting minimization over $n$ auxiliary variables (where $n$ is the dataset size) via $\textbf{variational analysis}$ into the minimization over a compact neural network that predicts the log-normalizers. We design an alternating optimization algorithm that jointly trains the CLIP model and the auxiliary network. By employing a tailored architecture and acceleration techniques for the auxiliary network, NeuCLIP achieves more accurate normalizer estimation, leading to improved performance compared with previous methods. Extensive experiments on large-scale CLIP training, spanning datasets from millions to billions of samples, demonstrate that NeuCLIP outperforms previous methods.

*Hannah Lydon,Milad Kazemi,Martin Bishop,Nicola Paoletti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) approach for cardiac electrophysiology modeling that learns mappings between function spaces, enabling generalization across mesh resolutions and initial conditions with improved long-term stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PDE solvers are computationally expensive and sensitive to discretization, while deep learning methods struggle with chaotic dynamics and long-term predictions. PINNs have limitations with mesh resolution and predictive stability.

Method: Proposed Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) that learns mappings between function spaces rather than point-wise solutions, allowing generalization to multiple mesh resolutions and initial conditions.

Result: PINO accurately reproduces cardiac EP dynamics over extended time horizons, performs zero-shot evaluations on unseen scenarios, maintains quality in long roll-outs, and scales resolution up to 10x training resolution with significant speedup over numerical solvers.

Conclusion: PINO-based approaches offer efficient and scalable cardiac EP simulations with advantages in generalization, resolution scaling, and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Accurately simulating systems governed by PDEs, such as voltage fields in cardiac electrophysiology (EP) modelling, remains a significant modelling challenge. Traditional numerical solvers are computationally expensive and sensitive to discretisation, while canonical deep learning methods are data-hungry and struggle with chaotic dynamics and long-term predictions. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) mitigate some of these issues by incorporating physical constraints in the learning process, yet they remain limited by mesh resolution and long-term predictive stability. In this work, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) approach to solve PDE problems in cardiac EP. Unlike PINNs, PINO models learn mappings between function spaces, allowing them to generalise to multiple mesh resolutions and initial conditions. Our results show that PINO models can accurately reproduce cardiac EP dynamics over extended time horizons and across multiple propagation scenarios, including zero-shot evaluations on scenarios unseen during training. Additionally, our PINO models maintain high predictive quality in long roll-outs (where predictions are recursively fed back as inputs), and can scale their predictive resolution by up to 10x the training resolution. These advantages come with a significant reduction in simulation time compared to numerical PDE solvers, highlighting the potential of PINO-based approaches for efficient and scalable cardiac EP simulations.

*Zeyang Li,Kaveh Alim,Navid Azizan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HardFlow: A novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as trajectory optimization using numerical optimal control to satisfy constraints precisely at terminal time while maintaining sample quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing projection-based methods for enforcing hard constraints in generative models are overly restrictive and degrade sample quality, while many applications require precise constraint satisfaction.

Method: Leverages numerical optimal control to steer sampling trajectories, exploits flow-matching model structure, and uses model predictive control techniques to transform complex constrained optimization into tractable surrogate problems.

Result: HardFlow substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality across robotics planning, PDE boundary control, and text-guided image editing domains.

Conclusion: The trajectory optimization perspective provides a unified framework for hard constraint satisfaction with flexibility to include additional objectives like minimizing distribution shift and enhancing sample quality.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-matching have emerged as powerful methodologies for generative modeling, with remarkable success in capturing complex data distributions and enabling flexible guidance at inference time. Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality.

### [300] [Coherence Mechanisms for Provable Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08440)
*Mehryar Mohri,Jon Schneider,Yifan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A principled framework for self-improvement in language models based on coherence, providing formal guarantees of monotonic improvement through projection-based mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-improvement approaches rely on empirical heuristics without formal guarantees, highlighting the need for a principled framework with theoretical foundations.

Method: Uses projection-based mechanisms that update baseline models to be coherent under task-preserving input transformations while minimizing deviation from original behavior.

Result: Achieves monotonic improvement with rigorous theoretical guarantees, works in non-realizable settings and finite-sample distributions, and establishes coherence as a fundamental principle.

Conclusion: Coherence is a necessary principle for provable self-improvement, with characterization theorems showing any mechanism with similar guarantees must conform to coherence-based structure.

Abstract: Self-improvement is a critical capability for large language models and other intelligent systems, enabling them to refine their behavior and internal consistency without external supervision. Despite its importance, prior approaches largely rely on empirical heuristics and lack formal guarantees. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for self-improvement based on the concept of \emph{coherence}, which requires that a model's outputs remain consistent under task-preserving transformations of the input.
  We formalize this concept using projection-based mechanisms that update a baseline model to be coherent while remaining as close as possible to its original behavior. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that these mechanisms achieve \emph{monotonic improvement}, measured by a reduction in expected Bregman divergence. Our analysis is comprehensive, covering both \emph{direct} and \emph{two-step} projection methods, and robustly extends these guarantees to non-realizable settings, empirical (finite-sample) distributions, and relaxed coherence constraints.
  Furthermore, we establish a general \emph{characterization theorem}, showing that any mechanism with similar provable improvement guarantees must inherently conform to a coherence-based structure. This culminates in rigidity results under the demand for universal improvement, establishing coherence as a fundamental and, in a formal sense, necessary principle for provable self-improvement.

### [301] [One Model for All: Universal Pre-training for EEG based Emotion Recognition across Heterogeneous Datasets and Paradigms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08444)
*Xiang Li,You Li,Yazhou Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes 'One Model for All' - a universal pre-training framework for EEG emotion recognition that handles dataset heterogeneity through two-stage learning: univariate pre-training and multivariate fine-tuning with novel ART and GAT architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG-based emotion recognition faces challenges with dataset heterogeneity (channel/subject variability) and poor knowledge transfer between datasets, limiting generalizable models.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Univariate pre-training via self-supervised contrastive learning on individual channels using Unified Channel Schema; (2) Multivariate fine-tuning with Adaptive Resampling Transformer (ART) and Graph Attention Network (GAT) to capture spatio-temporal dependencies.

Result: Achieves new SOTA on all benchmarks: SEED (99.27%), DEAP (93.69%), DREAMER (93.93%). Shows SOTA cross-dataset transfer (94.08% on unseen DREAMER). GAT module critical with +22.19% gain over GCN on DEAP.

Conclusion: Universal pre-training stabilizes learning and enables effective cross-dataset transfer, paving the way for more universal and scalable pre-trained models for EEG analysis.

Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition is hampered by profound dataset heterogeneity (channel/subject variability), hindering generalizable models. Existing approaches struggle to transfer knowledge effectively. We propose 'One Model for All', a universal pre-training framework for EEG analysis across disparate datasets. Our paradigm decouples learning into two stages: (1) Univariate pre-training via self-supervised contrastive learning on individual channels, enabled by a Unified Channel Schema (UCS) that leverages the channel union (e.g., SEED-62ch, DEAP-32ch); (2) Multivariate fine-tuning with a novel 'ART' (Adaptive Resampling Transformer) and 'GAT' (Graph Attention Network) architecture to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Experiments show universal pre-training is an essential stabilizer, preventing collapse on SEED (vs. scratch) and yielding substantial gains on DEAP (+7.65%) and DREAMER (+3.55%). Our framework achieves new SOTA performance on all within-subject benchmarks: SEED (99.27%), DEAP (93.69%), and DREAMER (93.93%). We also show SOTA cross-dataset transfer, achieving 94.08% (intersection) and 93.05% (UCS) on the unseen DREAMER dataset, with the former surpassing the within-domain pre-training benchmark. Ablation studies validate our architecture: the GAT module is critical, yielding a +22.19% gain over GCN on the high-noise DEAP dataset, and its removal causes a catastrophic -16.44% performance drop. This work paves the way for more universal, scalable, and effective pre-trained models for diverse EEG analysis tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches for handling categorical features with MAE criterion in CART rely on numerical encoding methods, but these unsupervised methods are ineffective.

Method: Proposed a novel and efficient splitting algorithm specifically designed for categorical features using the MAE criterion in CART.

Result: Demonstrated that unsupervised numerical encoding methods are not viable for MAE criteria, and the new algorithm effectively addresses categorical feature splitting challenges.

Conclusion: The new algorithm offers a promising solution to enhance categorical data handling in CART algorithms, overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: In the context of the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm, the efficient splitting of categorical features using standard criteria like GINI and Entropy is well-established. However, using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion for categorical features has traditionally relied on various numerical encoding methods. This paper demonstrates that unsupervised numerical encoding methods are not viable for the MAE criteria. Furthermore, we present a novel and efficient splitting algorithm that addresses the challenges of handling categorical features with the MAE criterion. Our findings underscore the limitations of existing approaches and offer a promising solution to enhance the handling of categorical data in CART algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate localization of multiple transmitters is challenging due to diffusion stochasticity and overlapping molecule distributions at receiver surface.

Result: Significant improvements with localization error reduction between 69% (2-Tx) and 43% (4-Tx) compared to K-means.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address multi-transmitter localization challenges in molecular communication via diffusion.

Abstract: Transmitter localization in Molecular Communication via Diffusion is a critical topic with many applications. However, accurate localization of multiple transmitters is a challenging problem due to the stochastic nature of diffusion and overlapping molecule distributions at the receiver surface. To address these issues, we introduce clustering-based centroid correction methods that enhance robustness against density variations, and outliers. In addition, we propose two clusteringguided Residual Neural Networks, namely AngleNN for direction refinement and SizeNN for cluster size estimation. Experimental results show that both approaches provide significant improvements with reducing localization error between 69% (2-Tx) and 43% (4-Tx) compared to the K-means.

TL;DR: LeJEPA introduces a theoretically grounded JEPA training objective with SIGReg regularization that constrains embeddings to follow an optimal isotropic Gaussian distribution, achieving stable performance across domains with minimal hyperparameters and code complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) lack practical guidance and theoretical foundations, leading to ad-hoc research and development in learning manipulable world representations.

Method: Combines JEPA predictive loss with Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization (SIGReg) to constrain embeddings to follow the optimal isotropic Gaussian distribution, eliminating need for heuristics like stop-gradient or teacher-student approaches.

Result: Achieves 79% accuracy on ImageNet-1k with ViT-H/14 using linear evaluation, demonstrates stability across 10+ datasets and 60+ architectures with varying scales and domains, and requires only ≈50 lines of code.

Conclusion: LeJEPA's simplicity and theory-friendly ecosystem can reestablish self-supervised pre-training as a core pillar of AI research by providing a lean, scalable, and theoretically grounded approach.

Abstract: Learning manipulable representations of the world and its dynamics is central to AI. Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) offer a promising blueprint, but lack of practical guidance and theory has led to ad-hoc R&D. We present a comprehensive theory of JEPAs and instantiate it in {\bf LeJEPA}, a lean, scalable, and theoretically grounded training objective. First, we identify the isotropic Gaussian as the optimal distribution that JEPAs' embeddings should follow to minimize downstream prediction risk. Second, we introduce a novel objective--{\bf Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization} (SIGReg)--to constrain embeddings to reach that ideal distribution. Combining the JEPA predictive loss with SIGReg yields LeJEPA with numerous theoretical and practical benefits: (i) single trade-off hyperparameter, (ii) linear time and memory complexity, (iii) stability across hyper-parameters, architectures (ResNets, ViTs, ConvNets) and domains, (iv) heuristics-free, e.g., no stop-gradient, no teacher-student, no hyper-parameter schedulers, and (v) distributed training-friendly implementation requiring only $\approx$50 lines of code. Our empirical validation covers 10+ datasets, 60+ architectures, all with varying scales and domains. As an example, using imagenet-1k for pretraining and linear evaluation with frozen backbone, LeJEPA reaches 79\% with a ViT-H/14. We hope that the simplicity and theory-friendly ecosystem offered by LeJEPA will reestablish self-supervised pre-training as a core pillar of AI research (\href{git@github.com:rbalestr-lab/lejepa.git}{GitHub repo}).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR appears sparse but actually learns off principal directions in weight space with minimal spectral drift, while SFT targets principal weights and distorts the spectrum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the paradox that RLVR improves reasoning performance while appearing to modify only a small fraction of parameters, and understand the underlying optimization dynamics.

Method: Proposed Three-Gate Theory: Gate I (KL Anchor) constrains updates, Gate II (Model Geometry) steers steps into low-curvature subspaces, Gate III (Precision) hides micro-updates making bias appear as sparsity.

Result: RLVR learns off principal directions with minimal spectral drift, reduced principal-subspace rotation, and off-principal update alignment, while SFT targets principal weights and distorts spectrum.

Conclusion: RL operates in distinct optimization regime from SFT, requiring RL-native learning algorithms rather than repurposed SFT-era heuristics.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) reliably improves the reasoning performance of large language models, yet it appears to modify only a small fraction of parameters. We revisit this paradox and show that sparsity is a surface artifact of a model-conditioned optimization bias: for a fixed pretrained model, updates consistently localize to preferred parameter regions, highly consistent across runs and largely invariant to datasets and RL recipes. We mechanistically explain these dynamics with a Three-Gate Theory: Gate I (KL Anchor) imposes a KL-constrained update; Gate II (Model Geometry) steers the step off principal directions into low-curvature, spectrum-preserving subspaces; and Gate III (Precision) hides micro-updates in non-preferred regions, making the off-principal bias appear as sparsity. We then validate this theory and, for the first time, provide a parameter-level characterization of RLVR's learning dynamics: RLVR learns off principal directions in weight space, achieving gains via minimal spectral drift, reduced principal-subspace rotation, and off-principal update alignment. In contrast, SFT targets principal weights, distorts the spectrum, and even lags RLVR.
  Together, these results provide the first parameter-space account of RLVR's training dynamics, revealing clear regularities in how parameters evolve. Crucially, we show that RL operates in a distinct optimization regime from SFT, so directly adapting SFT-era parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods can be flawed, as evidenced by our case studies on advanced sparse fine-tuning and LoRA variants. We hope this work charts a path toward a white-box understanding of RLVR and the design of geometry-aware, RLVR-native learning algorithms, rather than repurposed SFT-era heuristics.

*Jamison Moody,James Usevitch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaptKAN improves Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks by enabling autonomous domain grid updates using histogram-based algorithms, eliminating manual adjustments while maintaining or exceeding performance on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Original KANs require manual domain grid adjustments during training, creating user overhead and lacking autonomous adaptation to changing layer output ranges.

Method: Uses histogram-based algorithms to autonomously update domain grids in a data-driven manner, allowing layers to adapt to changing output ranges from previous layers.

Result: AdaptKAN matches or exceeds prior KAN architectures and MLPs on learning scientific equations, image classification, control Lyapunov functions, and OOD detection tasks.

Conclusion: AdaptKAN successfully automates domain grid updates while maintaining performance, with the added benefit of OOD detection capability.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a class of neural networks that have received increased attention in recent literature. In contrast to MLPs, KANs leverage parameterized, trainable activation functions and offer several benefits including improved interpretability and higher accuracy on learning symbolic equations. However, the original KAN architecture requires adjustments to the domain discretization of the network (called the "domain grid") during training, creating extra overhead for the user in the training process. Typical KAN layers are not designed with the ability to autonomously update their domains in a data-driven manner informed by the changing output ranges of previous layers. As an added benefit, this histogram algorithm may also be applied towards detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs in a variety of settings. We demonstrate that AdaptKAN exceeds or matches the performance of prior KAN architectures and MLPs on four different tasks: learning scientific equations from the Feynman dataset, image classification from frozen features, learning a control Lyapunov function, and detecting OOD inputs on the OpenOOD v1.5 benchmark.

*Mehmet Can Yavuz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MVAE is a VAE variant that enables full-covariance posteriors while maintaining Gaussian tractability, using global coupling and local scaling to improve reconstruction, calibration, and latent structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of diagonal posterior covariance in standard VAEs, which restricts modeling of latent correlations and uncertainty.

Method: Factorizes posterior covariance using a global coupling matrix for dataset-wide correlations and per-sample diagonal scales for local uncertainty, with efficient reparameterization via L=Cdiag(σ).

Result: Consistently matches or improves reconstruction (MSE↓) and delivers robust gains in calibration (NLL/Brier/ECE↓) and unsupervised structure (NMI/ARI↑) across multiple datasets, especially at mid-range latent sizes.

Conclusion: MVAE provides a tractable full-covariance alternative to diagonal VAEs that improves performance across multiple metrics while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: We present the Multivariate Variational Autoencoder (MVAE), a VAE variant that preserves Gaussian tractability while lifting the diagonal posterior restriction. MVAE factorizes each posterior covariance, where a \emph{global} coupling matrix $\mathbf{C}$ induces dataset-wide latent correlations and \emph{per-sample} diagonal scales modulate local uncertainty. This yields a full-covariance family with analytic KL and an efficient reparameterization via $\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{C}\mathrm{diag}(\boldsymbolσ)$. Across Larochelle-style MNIST variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, MVAE consistently matches or improves reconstruction (MSE~$\downarrow$) and delivers robust gains in calibration (NLL/Brier/ECE~$\downarrow$) and unsupervised structure (NMI/ARI~$\uparrow$) relative to diagonal-covariance VAEs with matched capacity, especially at mid-range latent sizes. Latent-plane visualizations further indicate smoother, more coherent factor traversals and sharper local detail. We release a fully reproducible implementation with training/evaluation scripts and sweep utilities to facilitate fair comparison and reuse.
