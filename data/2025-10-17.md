### [1] [MultiFoodhat: A potential new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13889)
*Yue Hu,Guohang Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiFoodChat is a dialogue-driven multi-agent framework for zero-shot food recognition that combines vision-language models and large language models to enable collaborative reasoning without requiring labeled training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised food classification models depend on large labeled datasets and struggle with generalization to unseen food categories, limiting their practical application in food quality inspection and dietary assessment.

Method: The framework integrates VLMs and LLMs for multi-round visual-textual dialogues, using an Object Perception Token (OPT) to capture fine-grained visual attributes and an Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) to dynamically interpret contextual cues through collaborative reasoning.

Result: Experiments on multiple public food datasets show that MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability compared to existing unsupervised and few-shot methods.

Conclusion: MultiFoodChat represents a promising new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and analysis, offering human-like understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual annotations.

Abstract: Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality
inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most
existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges,
this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning
framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable
collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object
Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an
Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to
refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like
understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual
annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that
MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability
compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods, highlighting its
potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and
analysis.

*Andreas Leibetseder,Klaus Schoeffmann,Jörg Keckstein,Simon Keckstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A system for segmenting dark endometrial implants in laparoscopic surgery videos to assist gynecologic physicians in identifying endometriosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endometriosis has complex visual appearances and is difficult to identify, especially for non-specialists. The system aims to help gynecologic physicians by providing automated detection assistance.

Method: Train a system to segment dark endometrial implants from laparoscopic surgery videos, using multi-colored overlays to annotate identified regions and displaying detection summaries.

Result: The system can analyze laparoscopic videos, identify implant regions, and provide visual annotations with detection summaries for improved video browsing.

Conclusion: The developed system provides valuable assistance to gynecologic physicians in identifying endometriosis through automated segmentation of dark endometrial implants in surgical videos.

Abstract: Endometriosis is a common women's condition exhibiting a manifold visual
appearance in various body-internal locations. Having such properties makes its
identification very difficult and error-prone, at least for laymen and
non-specialized medical practitioners. In an attempt to provide assistance to
gynecologic physicians treating endometriosis, this demo paper describes a
system that is trained to segment one frequently occurring visual appearance of
endometriosis, namely dark endometrial implants. The system is capable of
analyzing laparoscopic surgery videos, annotating identified implant regions
with multi-colored overlays and displaying a detection summary for improved
video browsing.

### [3] [Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13993)
*Jia Yun Chua,Argyrios Zolotas,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes combining traditional vision models (YOLO) with Vision Language Models (VLMs) like LLaVA, ChatGPT, and Gemini to improve remote sensing image analysis, particularly for aircraft detection and scene understanding in challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing generates vast data but traditional models require extensive labeled data and struggle with contextual understanding. VLMs offer complementary capabilities but their application to remote sensing remains underexplored.

Method: Integration of YOLO with VLMs (LLaVA, ChatGPT, Gemini) for enhanced image interpretation. Evaluation on both labeled and unlabeled remote sensing data, including degraded image scenarios.

Result: 48.46% average MAE improvement in aircraft detection accuracy across models, especially in challenging conditions. 6.17% improvement in CLIPScore for comprehensive image understanding in both raw and degraded scenarios.

Conclusion: The combination of traditional vision models and VLMs enables more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, particularly beneficial for few-shot learning scenarios.

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI model using EfficientNetV2-S with multiple instance learning achieves pathologist-level performance for detecting cribriform morphology in prostate cancer biopsies, outperforming expert uropathologists in inter-rater agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer indicates poor prognosis but is underreported and suffers from significant interobserver variability among pathologists, necessitating improved detection methods.

Method: Deep learning model with EfficientNetV2-S encoder and multiple instance learning trained on 640 prostate core needle biopsies from 430 patients across three cohorts, validated internally and externally with expert annotations.

Result: Model achieved AUC 0.97 (internal) and 0.90 (external), with highest average agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66) outperforming all nine pathologists (kappa range: 0.35-0.62).

Conclusion: AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for cribriform morphology detection, potentially enhancing diagnostic reliability, standardizing reporting, and improving prostate cancer treatment decisions.

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

### [5] [NAPPure: Adversarial Purification for Robust Image Classification under Non-Additive Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14025)
*Junjie Nan,Jianing Li,Wei Chen,Mingkun Zhang,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAPPure is an adversarial purification framework that handles non-additive perturbations like blur and occlusion, unlike existing methods designed only for additive perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial purification methods are ineffective against non-additive perturbations (blur, occlusion, distortion) since they're designed for additive perturbations, creating a gap in real-world defense capabilities.

Method: Establishes adversarial image generation process and disentangles clean image from perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization.

Result: Experiments on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 show NAPPure significantly boosts model robustness against non-additive perturbations.

Conclusion: NAPPure effectively extends adversarial purification to handle non-additive perturbations, filling an important gap in real-world adversarial defense.

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial
image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However,
non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion
are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing
adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are
designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended
adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle
non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation
process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean
image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments
on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the
robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

### [6] [Vgent: Graph-based Retrieval-Reasoning-Augmented Generation For Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14032)
*Xiaoqian Shen,Wenxuan Zhang,Jun Chen,Mohamed Elhoseiny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vgent is a graph-based retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework that enhances large video language models for long video understanding by preserving temporal dependencies and reducing retrieval noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video RAG methods face challenges with disrupted temporal dependencies and irrelevant information when processing long videos, which hinders accurate reasoning.

Method: Uses structured graph representations of videos to preserve semantic relationships across clips, and introduces an intermediate reasoning step with structured verification to reduce noise and aggregate relevant information.

Result: Achieved 3.0%-5.4% improvement over base models on MLVU benchmark and outperformed state-of-the-art video RAG methods by 8.6%.

Conclusion: Vgent effectively addresses long video understanding challenges by combining graph-based retrieval with structured reasoning, significantly improving LVLM performance.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for
large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing
intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential
information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated
effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs);
however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal
dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate
reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based
retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long
video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It
represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video
clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an
intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs,
which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and
facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips,
resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively
evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video
understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance
improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed
state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available

### [7] [Synchronization of Multiple Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14051)
*Avihai Naaman,Ron Shapira Weber,Oren Freifeld*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPL is a prototype-based framework for synchronizing videos from different scenes or generative AI videos by learning a shared 1D representation that anchors key action phases, avoiding exhaustive pairwise matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synchronizing videos from different scenes or generative AI videos is challenging due to diverse subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment, requiring more sophisticated approaches than simple time shifts.

Method: Temporal Prototype Learning (TPL) constructs a compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings using pretrained models, learning a unified prototype sequence that anchors key action phases for robust video alignment.

Result: TPL improves synchronization accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks, and is the first approach to address synchronization in multiple generative AI videos.

Conclusion: TPL provides an effective framework for complex video synchronization tasks, particularly for generative AI videos and cross-scene scenarios, with demonstrated improvements in performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the
same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts.
However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently,
generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse
subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal
Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared,
compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of
various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified
prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive
pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including
fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL
is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative
AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video
synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations: single-view approaches suffer from geometric inconsistencies and hallucinations, while synthetic data-trained models fail to capture high-frequency details like skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism.

Method: Two key contributions: (1) generative canonicalization module that processes multiple unstructured views into standardized representation, and (2) transformer-based model trained on large-scale dataset of high-fidelity Gaussian splatting avatars from dome captures of real people.

Result: The 'Capture, Canonicalize, Splat' pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured photos.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches by creating identity-preserving, hyperrealistic 3D avatars from few unstructured phone images through a novel zero-shot pipeline.

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic,
identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing
methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric
inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while
models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like
skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key
contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple
unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a
transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity
Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This
"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars
with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured

*Alexandr A. Kalinin,Anne E. Carpenter,Shantanu Singh,Matthew J. O'Meara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: cubic is a Python library that provides GPU-accelerated alternatives to SciPy and scikit-image APIs for scalable bioimage analysis, enabling faster processing of 2D/3D biological images while maintaining compatibility with existing workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bioimage analysis tools face scalability issues with large microscopy datasets, lack GPU acceleration, have poor 3D processing capabilities, and lack integration with modern scientific computing workflows.

Method: cubic augments SciPy and scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM, using a device-agnostic API that automatically dispatches operations to GPU when data is available on device.

Result: Benchmarks show substantial speedups for individual operations and complete pipelines (deconvolution and segmentation) while maintaining algorithmic fidelity.

Conclusion: cubic establishes a foundation for scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the Python scientific computing ecosystem, enabling both interactive exploration and high-throughput automated workflows.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for
understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in
biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D
datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their
scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing
workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable
interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability
for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python
library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and
scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.
cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data
reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a
broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU
acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to
segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both
by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution
and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining
algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for
scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader
Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods,
enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis
workflows. cubic is openly available at

Motivation: To advance the integration of video generation into virtual production by providing strong multi-view identity preservation, precise camera control, and lighting adaptability.

Method: Training character consistency with volumetric capture performances re-rendered via 4DGS with diverse camera trajectories and lighting variability. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art video diffusion models on this data, supporting multi-subject generation through joint training and noise blending.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera control and lighting adaptability.

Conclusion: The framework advances virtual production capabilities with multi-view consistency, precise camera control, and supports multi-subject generation, scene customization, and motion/spatial layout control.

Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency
and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization
data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera
control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video
generation into virtual production. Our project page is available at:

### [11] [Joint Modeling of Big Five and HEXACO for Multimodal Apparent Personality-trait Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14203)
*Ryo Masumura,Shota Orihashi,Mana Ihori,Tomohiro Tanaka,Naoki Makishima,Taiga Yamane,Naotaka Kawata,Satoshi Suzuki,Taichi Katayama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes joint modeling of Big Five and HEXACO personality traits for multimodal apparent personality recognition, addressing gaps in previous research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies focused only on Big Five traits, missing HEXACO's Honesty-Humility dimension and unclear relationships between the two models when using machine learning.

Method: Joint optimization method for recognizing both Big Five and HEXACO personality traits from multimodal human behavior data.

Result: Experiments using self-introduction video dataset show effective recognition of both Big Five and HEXACO traits.

Conclusion: The proposed joint modeling approach successfully recognizes both personality models and improves multimodal human behavior awareness.

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

*Hongsong Wang,Renxi Cheng,Yang Zhang,Chaolei Han,Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for detecting AI-generated images using bit-plane-based noise analysis, achieving 98.9% accuracy and millisecond-level processing speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated image detection methods have high computational costs and fail to capture intrinsic noisy features in raw images, making them inefficient and less effective.

Method: Uses bit-plane-based image processing to extract noise patterns, applies image normalization strategies, implements maximum gradient patch selection to amplify noise signals, and designs lightweight classification heads with noise-based and noise-guided structures.

Result: Achieves 98.9% average accuracy on GenImage benchmark (11.9% improvement), excellent cross-generator generalization (98.2% from GAN to Diffusion, 99.2% from Diffusion to GAN), and millisecond-level processing that is nearly 100x faster than existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses computational efficiency and feature extraction limitations in AI-generated image detection, demonstrating superior performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
(\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

*Soumyya Kanti Datta,Tanvi Ranga,Chengzhe Sun,Siwei Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal audio-visual framework called PIA that detects deepfakes by analyzing phoneme-temporal patterns and identity-dynamic features across language, face motion, and facial identification cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deepfake detection methods relying on manual phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, frame-level consistency checks, or unimodal strategies fail to detect advanced deepfakes from GANs, diffusion models, and neural rendering that create subtle temporal discrepancies.

Method: PIA framework integrates phoneme sequences, lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings to analyze inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities including language, dynamic face motion, and facial identification.

Result: The integrated multimodal approach significantly improves detection of subtle deepfake alterations by identifying inconsistencies that traditional methods overlook.

Conclusion: The proposed PIA framework effectively addresses limitations of conventional deepfake detectors by leveraging complementary audio-visual modalities to catch temporal and identity inconsistencies in advanced generative manipulations.

Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious
threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync
modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional
detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed
phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency
checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day
deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion
models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate
nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal
discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a
novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic
Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial
identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,
lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated
method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by
identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities. Code is

Motivation: Existing event-based OCC systems use conventional modulation schemes that don't fully exploit the unique asynchronous characteristics of event-based vision sensors, limiting performance.

Method: Developed EIM scheme that modulates information using intervals between events, tuned EVS parameters for optimal frequency response, experimentally determined maximum modulation order, and conducted transmission experiments.

Result: Achieved successful transmission at 28 kbps over 10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in indoor environments, setting a new benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

Conclusion: EIM effectively leverages the unique characteristics of event-based vision sensors to significantly improve transmission speeds in optical camera communication systems.

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational limitations of Scene Coordinate Regression methods in large-scale scenes and enable efficient localization with high-quality rendering.

Method: Propose Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding (MACE) with gating network to select sub-networks, and Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing strategy for enhanced accuracy.

Result: Significant cost reduction while maintaining higher precision; achieves high-quality rendering with only 10 minutes of training on Cambridge test set.

Conclusion: MACE provides an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications with improved localization accuracy and rendering quality.

Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes
remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While
Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale
localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when
extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the
Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables
efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we
introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks,
ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference.
Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to
enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides
a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering
an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional
experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.

*Liao Shen,Wentao Jiang,Yiran Zhu,Tiezheng Ge,Zhiguo Cao,Bo Zheng*

TL;DR: IPRO is a reinforcement learning-based video diffusion framework that enhances identity preservation in image-to-video generation by optimizing models using a face identity scorer and KL-divergence regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-to-video models struggle with maintaining identity consistency when generating human-centric videos, especially when faces are small or undergo significant movements and expression changes.

Method: Proposed Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO) - a tuning algorithm that uses a face identity scorer, backpropagates rewards through sampling chain steps, employs facial feature pools from ground-truth videos, and incorporates KL-divergence regularization.

Result: Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V model and in-house I2V model demonstrate the method's effectiveness in preserving identity consistency.

Conclusion: IPRO provides a direct and effective solution for identity preservation in human-centric image-to-video generation without requiring architectural changes or auxiliary modules.

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: Advanced video generation methods like VACE and Phantom struggle with maintaining consistent identities across multiple human characters in dynamic interactions, which is critical for realistic video generation.

Method: Proposed Identity-GRPO pipeline: 1) Construct a video reward model trained on large-scale preference dataset with human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, 2) Employ GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency optimization to enhance VACE and Phantom models.

Result: Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency metrics over baseline methods through extensive ablation studies evaluating annotation quality and design choices.

Conclusion: The method offers actionable insights for aligning reinforcement learning with personalized video generation and effectively addresses multi-human identity preservation challenges.

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation
for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human
identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities
across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose
Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining
multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video
reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing
human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations
focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a
GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both
VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of
annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show
that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency
metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning
reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

### [19] [MatchAttention: Matching the Relative Positions for High-Resolution Cross-View Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14260)
*Tingman Yan,Tao Liu,Xilian Yang,Qunfei Zhao,Zeyang Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MatchAttention for efficient cross-view matching with dynamic relative position matching and BilinearSoftmax for differentiable sliding-window attention, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks with low computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution image matching is challenging due to quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in existing cross-attention mechanisms.

Method: MatchAttention dynamically matches relative positions with BilinearSoftmax for differentiable sliding-window sampling. Uses hierarchical MatchDecoder with gated cross-MatchAttention and consistency-constrained loss to handle occlusions.

Result: MatchStereo-B ranked 1st on Middlebury benchmark (29ms for KITTI), MatchStereo-T processes 4K UHD in 0.1s with 3GB GPU. SOTA on KITTI 2012/2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets.

Conclusion: Enables real-time, high-resolution, high-accuracy cross-view matching with efficient computational complexity.

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at

Conclusion: Hybrid 2D-3D approaches show significant potential, with thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models and 3D reconstruction pipelines overcoming limitations inherent in either approach alone.

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details
or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the
inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches,
highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D
reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either

Result: Validated on CAMELYON17 and private histopathology datasets, achieving consistent performance gains across unseen domains with up to 7% improvement over existing baselines.

Conclusion: Causal inference shows strong potential as a powerful tool for addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis, outperforming traditional statistical correlation-based methods.

Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition
processes or data sources, poses a major challenge to the generalization
ability of deep learning models. Existing methods primarily rely on modeling
statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing

demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result,
our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and
the private histopathology dataset, outperforming existing baselines. These
results highlight the potential of causal inference as a powerful tool for
addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.

TL;DR: Proposes a training-free tri-layer contrastive decoding with watermarking to reduce hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by selecting mature/amateur layers, identifying pivot layers via watermark questions, and applying contrastive decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often suffer from hallucinations, relying too heavily on single modalities or memorizing training data without proper visual grounding.

Method: Three-step approach: select mature and amateur layers, identify pivot layer using watermark-related questions to assess visual grounding, apply tri-layer contrastive decoding for final output generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on POPE, MME and AMBER benchmarks in reducing hallucinations and generating more visually grounded responses.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free method effectively reduces hallucinations in LVLMs and improves visual grounding without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

TL;DR: MID-StyleGAN is a novel framework that generates synthetic ocular images for iris presentation attack detection, combining diffusion models and GANs to address data scarcity in biometric security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris presentation attack detection (PAD) methods due to difficulties in constructing and imaging presentation attacks (PAs) like artificial eyes, printed images, and cosmetic contact lenses.

Method: MID-StyleGAN combines diffusion models and GANs with a multi-domain architecture that enables translation between bonafide ocular images and different PA domains, using an adaptive loss function tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality synthetic ocular images. On LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%.

Conclusion: The generated synthetic data significantly enhances PAD system performance, providing a scalable solution to data scarcity in iris and ocular biometrics.

Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs)
where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic
contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several
presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there
is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due
to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this,
we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN
(MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that
captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as
bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the
strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a
multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular
images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function
tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating
high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to
significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable
solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For
example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect
rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream MLLMs focus only on next-token prediction of text, neglecting crucial vision-centric information needed for analytical visual comprehension.

Method: Introduces VaCo with Modular Task Queries (MTQs), Visual Alignment Layers (VALs), and Token Gateway Mask (TGM) to activate and coordinate visual signals from multiple VFMs while managing representation conflicts.

Result: Extensive experiments show VaCo significantly enhances performance of various MLLMs across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior visual comprehension capabilities.

Conclusion: VaCo successfully bridges the gap between text-only supervision and vision-centric optimization in MLLMs, enabling better multimodal understanding through coordinated visual feature integration.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual
encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However,
mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual
tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical
abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM
representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from
multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative
alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs,
thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs.
Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and
Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals
under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts
across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information
flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo
significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various
benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

Method: Uses cycle-consistent keypoints for spatial coherence constraints and introduces a novel pose block combining GRU recurrent units with transformation synchronization to blend historical and multi-view data.

Result: Surpasses previous self-supervised registration methods on ScanNet and 3DMatch datasets, even outperforming some older supervised methods. Components also improve existing methods when integrated.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively utilizes unlabeled RGB-D data through cycle-consistent keypoints and GRU-based pose modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised registration.

Abstract: With the rise in consumer depth cameras, a wealth of unlabeled RGB-D data has
become available. This prompts the question of how to utilize this data for

*Han Qiu,Peng Gao,Lewei Lu,Xiaoqin Zhang,Ling Shao,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPR is a Spatial Preference Rewarding approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial understanding by rewarding detailed responses with precise object localization over vague ones, using semantic and localization scores for evaluation and direct preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack fine-grained spatial perception abilities like detailed region descriptions and accurate object localization, and often fail to meet user requirements for spatial understanding due to focusing on pre-annotated instruction data without direct supervision of actual responses.

Method: SPR introduces semantic and localization scores to evaluate text and localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions, refines descriptions for better localization accuracy, and pairs best-scored refinements with lowest-scored initial descriptions for direct preference optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard referring and grounding benchmarks show that SPR effectively improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities with minimal training overhead.

Conclusion: SPR successfully enhances MLLMs' fine-grained spatial perception by rewarding precise localization and detailed responses through a preference-based optimization approach.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial
understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object
descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained
spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions
or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to
the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This
issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs
to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without
direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a
Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial
capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object
localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image
regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and
localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and
localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM
descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored
refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct
preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual
input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks
show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with
minimal overhead in training. Data and code will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with prompts containing multiple objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing across four problematic scenarios.

Method: DOS modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before passing them to text-to-image models to better separate objects.

Result: DOS consistently improves success rate of multi-object generation and reduces object mixing, outperforming four competing methods by 26.24%-43.04% in human evaluations.

Conclusion: DOS is a practical and effective solution for improving multi-object image generation in text-to-image models.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to
significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving
multi-object image generation.

TL;DR: Proposed DRBD-Mamba model for brain tumor segmentation that improves computational efficiency by 15x while maintaining competitive accuracy, with systematic evaluation on BraTS2023 data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational overhead of Mamba-based models and lack of robustness evaluation across diverse BraTS data partitions for reliable brain tumor segmentation.

Method: Dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba using space-filling curve for 3D-to-1D mapping, gated fusion module for context integration, and quantization block for feature discretization.

Result: Achieved Dice improvements: 0.10% whole tumor, 1.75% tumor core, 0.93% enhancing tumor; 15x efficiency improvement while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: DRBD-Mamba provides efficient and robust brain tumor segmentation with significant computational advantages over existing approaches.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and
treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions.
Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance.
However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential
feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness
across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a
critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose
dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation
model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal
computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial
locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on
computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature
representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates
forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes
features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds
on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse
conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the
20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of
0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor.
Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model
maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice
gains of 0.86\% for tumor core and 1.45\% for enhancing tumor over existing
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model attains 15 times improvement in
efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
robustness and computational advantage over existing approaches.

TL;DR: BoardVision is a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level motherboard defects using ensemble methods to balance precision and recall, with evaluation under realistic perturbations and a deployable GUI tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assembly-level inspection of full motherboards is underexplored compared to bare-board or trace-level PCB inspection, despite being critical for reliability in high-volume electronics manufacturing.

Method: Benchmarks YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN on MiracleFactory dataset, then proposes Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter) ensemble to balance their complementary strengths, with robustness evaluation under perturbations.

Result: YOLOv7 excels in precision but underperforms in recall, while Faster R-CNN shows the reverse; CTV Voter ensemble balances precision and recall through interpretable rules and maintains stability under perturbations.

Conclusion: Computer vision techniques can transition from benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard manufacturing, demonstrated through the deployable GUI-driven inspection tool.

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
manufacturing.

TL;DR: DCMIL is a dual-curriculum contrastive multi-instance learning model that efficiently processes whole slide images for cancer prognosis without dense annotations, outperforming standard methods across 12 cancer types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computational pathology faces challenges with gigapixel-size inputs and scarce manual annotations, while current methods overlook fine-grained multi-magnification information and tumor microenvironment variations.

Method: An easy-to-hard progressive representation learning model using dual-curriculum contrastive multi-instance learning to directly transform gigapixel WSIs into outcome predictions without dense annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments on 12 cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles) show DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models, identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides robust uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences.

Conclusion: DCMIL offers an effective approach for computational pathology that enables direct gigapixel WSI processing for cancer prognosis while providing biological insights, with all code made publicly available.

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in
harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity
and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is
impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the
scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook
fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in
tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive
representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive
multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer
prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct
transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive
experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles)
demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models.
Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides
robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences
between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological
insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at

*Hui Xiang,Yifan Bian,Li Li,Jingran Wu,Xianguo Zhang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural video compression framework that combines intra and inter coding in a unified model, addressing limitations like disocclusion handling and error propagation in existing NVC schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural video compression schemes have limitations in handling disocclusion, new content, and interframe error propagation. The paper aims to address these by borrowing the intra coding concept from classic video coding.

Method: Proposes an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding using a single adaptive model, plus a simultaneous two-frame compression design that exploits both forward and backward interframe redundancy.

Result: Outperforms DCVC-RT by 10.7% average BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality per frame, while maintaining real-time encoding/decoding performance.

Conclusion: The unified intra/inter coding approach effectively handles disocclusion and new content while preventing error propagation, achieving superior compression efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
models will be released.

TL;DR: A minimally distorted universal adversarial attack for video object detection using nuclear norm regularization and adaptive optimistic exponentiated gradient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based object detectors are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially universal perturbations, which poses risks in safety-critical video applications.

Method: Proposed nuclear norm regularization to create structured perturbations concentrated in background, optimized using adaptive optimistic exponentiated gradient method for efficiency.

Result: The attack outperforms low-rank projected gradient descent and Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient and effective universal adversarial attack for video object detection with minimal distortion.

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

*Youwan Mahé,Elise Bannier,Stéphanie Leplaideur,Elisa Fromont,Francesca Galassi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised deep generative models offer promising alternative to supervised methods for brain anomaly detection, enabling training on healthy data only and identifying anomalies as deviations from learned normative structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised methods require large annotated datasets and are limited to well-characterized pathologies, while unsupervised generative models can work with healthy data only and handle diverse pathologies.

Method: PRISMA-guided scoping review synthesizing 49 studies (2018-2025) on autoencoders, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models for brain MRI and CT anomaly detection.

Result: Generative models achieved encouraging performance for large focal lesions and showed progress in detecting subtle abnormalities. Key strength is producing interpretable pseudo-healthy reconstructions, valuable for rare or heterogeneous diseases.

Conclusion: Unsupervised generative models offer compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning, biomarker discovery, and cross-disease deviation mapping. Future work should focus on anatomy-aware modeling, foundation models, appropriate metrics, and clinical validation.

Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative
to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging.
Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated
datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be
trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from
learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review
synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly
detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,
generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49
studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to
brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,
stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance
metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the
included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large
focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle
abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce
interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual)
reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce,
as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a
compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning,
supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within-
and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To
realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling,
development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and
rigorous clinical validation.

*Thomas Katraouras,Dimitrios Rafailidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MIR-L, a compression strategy for multi-task image restoration models using iterative pruning to find highly sparse subnetworks that maintain performance with only 10% of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task image restoration models have high computational costs due to excessive parameters, making them inefficient for practical applications despite their ability to handle multiple degradation types simultaneously.

Method: Uses iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude weights across multiple rounds while resetting remaining weights to original initialization, discovering sparse subnetworks ('winning tickets') within overparameterized models.

Result: Experimental evaluation on deraining, dehazing, and denoising tasks shows MIR-L retains only 10% of trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance comparable to dense counterparts.

Conclusion: The proposed compression strategy effectively reduces computational overhead of multi-task image restoration models while preserving performance, making them more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content
on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy
operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user
experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality
image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image
restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to
simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these
models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,
making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy
for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly
sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even
surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely
MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude
weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their
original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task
image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning
tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity
levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining,
dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the
trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our
code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for detecting seasonal grazing from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery using CNN-LSTM ensemble models, achieving 77% F1 score and demonstrating practical value for conservation compliance monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grazing monitoring is crucial for both agriculture and biodiversity conservation, but scalable monitoring methods are currently limited. The research aims to develop an automated system to detect grazing activities using freely available satellite data.

Method: Used Sentinel-2 L2A time series data from April-October for polygon-defined field boundaries. Trained an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance features for binary classification (grazed/not grazed).

Result: Achieved average F1 score of 77% across five validation splits, with 90% recall on grazed pastures. When prioritizing fields predicted as non-grazed, the model yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than random inspection with only 4% site visits.

Conclusion: Coarse-resolution, freely available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for conservation-aligned land-use compliance, making grazing monitoring more scalable and efficient.

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable
monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing
detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field
boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not
grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance
features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation
splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors
can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by
our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than
random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely
available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for
conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made

*Ali Kashefi,Tapan Mukerji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Mamba is introduced as a backbone for 3D porous media permeability prediction, showing better computational efficiency than ViTs and fewer parameters than CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage Vision Mamba's linear scaling with input resolution (vs ViT's quadratic scaling) and smaller parameter count than CNNs for more efficient permeability prediction in 3D porous media.

Method: Used Vision Mamba as backbone network for permeability prediction, compared with ViT and CNN models, and performed ablation study to assess component effects on accuracy.

Result: Demonstrated practical advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in permeability prediction of 3D porous media.

Conclusion: The proposed framework has potential to be integrated into large vision models where Vision Mamba replaces ViTs, with source code made available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba
scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically,
a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision
Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more
memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time,
a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the
permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of
Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability
prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its
components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned
advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of
three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to
facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and
extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be
integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of
ViTs.

### [39] [Noise Projection: Closing the Prompt-Agnostic Gap Behind Text-to-Image Misalignment in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14526)
*Yunze Tong,Didi Zhu,Zijing Hu,Jinluan Yang,Ziyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a noise projector that refines initial noise in text-to-image generation to improve text-image alignment by addressing training-inference mismatch in Stable Diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for text-to-image generation suffer from misalignment between generated images and prompts due to training-inference mismatch, where training uses prompt-specific noise but inference uses prompt-agnostic Gaussian noise.

Method: A noise projector is trained to map initial noise to prompt-aware counterparts using token-level feedback from a vision-language model, distilled into a reward model and optimized via quasi-direct preference optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show that prompt-aware noise projection improves text-image alignment across diverse prompts without modifying the Stable Diffusion model.

Conclusion: The proposed noise projector effectively addresses training-inference mismatch in text-to-image generation, improving alignment while requiring no reference images and adding minimal inference cost.

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but
radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained
professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI
systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design,

DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of
dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large
curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal
radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D
variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in
dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases,
imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows
impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to
diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker
identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation.
Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised,
self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior
generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM
enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than
experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PL-SE-ADA is a domain harmonization framework for brain MR images that uses pseudo-linear-style encoding to disentangle domain-invariant and domain-specific features while maintaining interpretability through visualization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images show domain shifts across imaging sites due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning performance. Existing domain harmonization methods lack interpretability, which is essential for medical applications.

Method: Proposes PL-SE-ADA with two encoders (f_E and f_SE) to extract domain-invariant (z_u) and domain-specific (z_d) features, a decoder for reconstruction, and a domain predictor. Uses adversarial training between encoder and domain predictor, and reconstructs input image by summing reconstructions from z_u and z_d.

Result: Achieves equal or better performance than prior methods in image reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. Enables visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific components.

Conclusion: PL-SE-ADA provides an interpretable domain harmonization framework that preserves disease-relevant information while offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

Motivation: Bridge the gap between opaque deep learning representations and interpretable classical visual descriptors by exploring whether modern learning can benefit from classical visual cues.

Method: Explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, uses reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme to capture essence of each visual descriptor while preserving interpretability.

Result: Enables effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks including image generation and editing, beyond conventional classification and segmentation.

Conclusion: VisualSplit demonstrates effectiveness of integrating classical visual descriptors into modern learning approaches, providing interpretable representations that facilitate attribute control in visual tasks.

Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.

### [44] [Exploring Cross-Modal Flows for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14543)
*Ziqi Jiang,Yanghao Wang,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMA proposes a multi-step cross-modal alignment method using flow matching to address limitations of one-step PEFT methods for complex datasets with highly entangled features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment which is insufficient for complex datasets where features from different modalities are highly entangled, requiring more precise alignment.

Method: Proposes Flow Matching Alignment (FMA) that learns a cross-modal velocity field with fixed coupling strategy, noise augmentation, and early-stopping solver for multi-step rectification.

Result: FMA consistently yields significant performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on challenging datasets with highly entangled features.

Conclusion: Multi-step adjustment through flow matching provides more precise and robust cross-modal alignment compared to one-step PEFT methods, especially for complex datasets.

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental
challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models
can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively
fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or
textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to
highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is
insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different
modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first
model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal
velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the
correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed
coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate
the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which
terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and
accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step
rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive
results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant
performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on
challenging datasets.

*Song Tang,Peihao Gong,Kunyu Li,Kai Guo,Boyu Wang,Mao Ye,Jianwei Zhang,Xiatian Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), a training-free prompt embedding editing method that addresses identity shift in text-to-image generation by suppressing scene-ID correlations through SVD-based eigenvalue re-weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I generation methods suffer from identity shift due to scene contextualization - the natural correlation between subject and scene context that models learn from training data. Existing approaches require unrealistic prior knowledge of all target scenes.

Method: SDeC identifies and suppresses latent scene-ID correlations in ID prompt embeddings by quantifying SVD directional stability to adaptively re-weight eigenvalues. It imposes an inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization.

Result: Experiments show SDeC significantly enhances identity preservation while maintaining scene diversity, working effectively without requiring prior access to all target scenes.

Conclusion: SDeC provides a flexible, general solution for consistent T2I generation that addresses the fundamental issue of scene contextualization, making it suitable for real-world applications where target scenes are unknown or vary over time.

Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce
identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it
often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods
have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of
knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of
ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called
scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training
distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of
this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On
this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding
editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an
inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it
identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID
prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively
re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene
use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.
This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world
applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over
time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity
preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BalanceGS is an algorithm-system co-design that optimizes 3D Gaussian Splatting training by addressing inefficiencies in density allocation, computation workload, and memory access, achieving 1.44× speedup with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3DGS suffers from three critical inefficiencies: skewed density allocation during Gaussian densification, imbalanced computation workload during Gaussian projection, and fragmented memory access during color splatting.

Method: Three-level optimization: (1) Algorithm-level heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to balance point distributions; (2) System-level similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging for adaptive workload distribution; (3) Mapping-level reordering-based memory access strategy with restructured RGB storage.

Result: Achieves 1.44× training speedup on NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible quality degradation compared to standard 3DGS, while removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions.

Conclusion: BalanceGS successfully addresses the key inefficiencies in 3DGS training through algorithm-system co-design, demonstrating significant performance improvements while maintaining reconstruction quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential
steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting.
Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach
suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation
during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during
Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system
co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we
propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically
balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions
while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose
Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static
one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads
now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster
density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access
mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in
shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach
achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible
quality degradation.

Motivation: To address the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features from 3D point clouds to distinguish between vehicles for re-identification tasks.

Method: Uses multi-branch architecture integrating edge convolution, point attention, and curvature embedding to characterize local surface variation in point clouds.

Result: Achieves mean re-identification accuracy improvement of approximately 1.97% points compared with the strongest baseline on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: Curvature information incorporation and multi-branch feature learning are effective for LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle re-identification.

Abstract: This paper presents CALM-Net, a curvature-aware LiDAR point cloud-based
multi-branch neural network for vehicle re-identification. The proposed model
addresses the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features
from three-dimensional point clouds to distinguish between vehicles. CALM-Net
employs a multi-branch architecture that integrates edge convolution, point
attention, and a curvature embedding that characterizes local surface variation
in point clouds. By combining these mechanisms, the model learns richer
geometric and contextual features that are well suited for the
re-identification task. Experimental evaluation on the large-scale nuScenes
dataset demonstrates that CALM-Net achieves a mean re-identification accuracy
improvement of approximately 1.97\% points compared with the strongest baseline
in our study. The results confirms the effectiveness of incorporating curvature
information into deep learning architectures and highlight the benefit of
multi-branch feature learning for LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle
re-identification.

*Matan Rusanovsky,Shimon Malnick,Shai Avidan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for pixel-level keypoint grounding through natural language, consisting of a Point Descriptor that generates contextual keypoint descriptions and a Point Localizer that regresses precise coordinates from these descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models lack pixel-precise keypoint comprehension through natural language, being limited to object-level or region-level grounding.

Method: Two-component framework: Point Descriptor generates free-form, coarse-to-fine keypoint descriptions, and Point Localizer regresses pixel coordinates. Trained on LlamaPointInPart dataset (20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets) using GRPO optimization with frozen Point Localizer as reward model.

Result: Superior performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart dataset. Enables bidirectional applications in keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the gap in pixel-precise keypoint understanding through natural language and enables new applications in cross-modal understanding.

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STANCE is an image-to-video framework that improves temporal coherence using Instance Cues for dense motion guidance and Dense RoPE to preserve motion token salience, with joint RGB+auxiliary prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation struggles with coherent object motion and interactions due to weak motion guidance from sparse 2D hints and appearance-motion optimization conflicts that favor texture over temporal consistency.

Method: Uses Instance Cues to convert sparse user hints into dense 2.5D motion fields, and Dense RoPE to preserve motion token salience. Employs joint RGB+auxiliary-map prediction to separate structure from appearance optimization.

Result: The approach reduces depth ambiguity, stabilizes optimization, and improves temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

Conclusion: STANCE effectively addresses motion coherence challenges in video generation through simple but effective components that provide better motion guidance and separate structure from appearance optimization.

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

Motivation: Existing retrieval-augmented generation methods struggle with multimodal query quality and relevance of retrieved results in knowledge-based visual question answering tasks.

Method: Three-stage approach: Processing stage uses visual tools for precise multimodal information extraction; Retrieval stage integrates visual and text features; Filtering stage performs relevance filtering. Uses reinforcement learning with answer accuracy and format consistency as reward signals.

Result: Achieved significant improvements of 36.0 and 42.8 on E-VQA and InfoSeek datasets respectively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed Wiki-PRF method effectively addresses challenges in KB-VQA by improving multimodal query quality and retrieval relevance through its three-stage architecture and reinforcement learning training.

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language
models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

TL;DR: Shot2Tactic-Caption is a dual-branch framework for badminton video captioning that generates both shot-level action descriptions and tactic-level temporal descriptions of tactical executions, including interrupted and resumed tactics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactical understanding in badminton requires interpreting both individual actions and how tactics dynamically unfold over time, which existing captioning methods don't adequately address.

Method: Uses a dual-branch design with visual encoder, spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and Transformer decoder for both shot and tactic captioning. Introduces Tactic Unit Detector and shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism using predicted tactic type and state as prompts injected via cross-attention.

Result: Framework effectively generates both shot and tactic captions. ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder performs best, and shot-wise prompt structuring produces more coherent and accurate tactic captions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses multi-scale tactical understanding in badminton, capable of describing both individual actions and complex tactical executions over time, including interrupted and resumed tactics.

Abstract: Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual
actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and
temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating
shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions
that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We
also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
captioning.

TL;DR: EVS is a plug-and-play method that reduces video token redundancy by pruning static patches across frames, enabling faster inference and longer video inputs without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models face scalability issues with long videos due to quadratic processing costs and token budget limitations, causing context constraints and latency problems.

Method: Efficient Video Sampling (EVS) identifies and removes temporally static patches (unchanged spatial regions across frames) while preserving positional identity, requiring no architectural changes.

Result: EVS reduces token count by up to 4x, decreases LLM time-to-first-token by up to 4x with minimal accuracy loss, and when combined with uptraining, maintains full performance under aggressive pruning.

Conclusion: EVS enables scalable video-language understanding by improving efficiency-accuracy trade-offs without sacrificing quality, unlocking practical long-video processing capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

TL;DR: RepTok is a generative modeling framework that uses a single continuous latent token from self-supervised vision transformers for efficient image generation, achieving competitive results with minimal training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more efficient generative modeling approach by resolving spatial redundancies in 2D latent spaces and reducing training costs while maintaining competitive performance.

Method: Fine-tunes only the semantic token embedding from a pre-trained SSL encoder, pairs it with a generative decoder trained using flow matching objective, and adds cosine-similarity loss to preserve SSL space geometry.

Result: Achieves competitive results on class-conditional ImageNet generation and reaches competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under extremely limited training budgets.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned SSL representations can serve as compact and effective latent spaces for efficient generative modeling.

Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
efficient generative modeling.

*Jihyun Yu,Yoojin Oh,Wonho Bae,Mingyu Kim,Junhyug Noh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SteeringTTA is an inference-only test-time adaptation framework that uses Feynman-Kac steering to guide diffusion-based input adaptation for classification, outperforming baselines on ImageNet-C without model updates or source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of gradient-based diffusion TTA methods that restrict exploration and generalization across different distortion types in test-time adaptation scenarios.

Method: Uses Feynman-Kac steering to guide diffusion-based input adaptation with rewards driven by pseudo-labels, maintaining multiple particle trajectories steered by cumulative top-K probabilities and entropy schedule to balance exploration and confidence.

Result: On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently outperforms the baseline without requiring any model updates or source data.

Conclusion: SteeringTTA provides an effective inference-only framework for test-time adaptation that improves robustness to distribution shifts through guided diffusion-based input adaptation.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep
models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled
test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for
classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting
exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA,
an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide
diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by
pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by
a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to
balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently
outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

*Xinyao Liao,Xianfang Zeng,Ziye Song,Zhoujie Fu,Gang Yu,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A low-cost pretraining strategy for instruction-based video editing that uses in-context learning from unpaired video clips, followed by fine-tuning with minimal paired data, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of high cost and complexity in constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets for instruction-based video editing.

Method: Pretrain a foundation video generation model using in-context learning from ~1M unpaired video clips, then fine-tune with <150k curated editing pairs. Built on HunyuanVideoT2V framework.

Result: Surpasses existing instruction-based video editing approaches with 12% improvement in instruction following and 15% improvement in editing quality.

Conclusion: The proposed low-cost pretraining strategy effectively endows video generation models with general editing capabilities and achieves superior performance with minimal paired data.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

*Kieran Carrigg,Rob van Gastel,Melda Yeghaian,Sander Dalm,Faysal Boughorbel,Marcel van Gerven*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DBP-MAE integrates Decorrelated Backpropagation into MAE pre-training to accelerate convergence, reducing training time by 21.1% and carbon emissions by 21.4% while improving downstream segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAE pre-training of vision transformers is computationally expensive and impractical for time- and resource-constrained industrial settings, requiring more efficient training methods.

Method: Integrate Decorrelated Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, applying it selectively to the encoder to iteratively reduce input correlations at each layer for faster convergence.

Result: DBP-MAE reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon emissions by 21.4%, and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points on ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DBP can effectively reduce training time and energy consumption while improving downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training, with demonstrated applicability in real-world industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

*Weikang Yu,Vincent Nwazelibe,Xianping Ma,Xiaokang Zhang,Richard Gloaguen,Xiao Xiang Zhu,Pedram Ghamisi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EuroMineNet is a comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining footprint mapping using Sentinel-2 imagery, covering 133 EU mining sites from 2015-2024 with expert-verified annotations to support GeoAI-based environmental monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mining activities cause environmental degradation but existing datasets lack temporal depth and geographic scope for consistent long-term monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes.

Method: Created EuroMineNet dataset with annual Sentinel-2 observations from 2015-2024 across 133 EU mining sites, supporting two tasks: multitemporal mining footprint mapping (using CA-TIoU metric) and cross-temporal change detection for gradual/abrupt transformations.

Result: Benchmarked 20 deep learning models showing GeoAI methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes but struggle with short-term dynamics needed for timely mitigation.

Conclusion: EuroMineNet advances temporally consistent mining monitoring for sustainable land-use management and environmental resilience, contributing to GeoAI applications for social and environmental good.

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

### [61] [WeCKD: Weakly-supervised Chained Distillation Network for Efficient Multimodal Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14668)
*Md. Abdur Rahman,Mohaimenul Azam Khan Raiaan,Sami Azam,Asif Karim,Jemima Beissbarth,Amanda Leach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeCKD introduces a chain-based knowledge distillation framework where models progressively learn and refine knowledge in sequence, achieving superior performance with minimal supervision compared to traditional KD methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KD suffers from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and requires strong teacher models or large datasets, limiting effectiveness in real-world limited-data scenarios.

Method: Progressive distillation chain where each model learns from its predecessor and refines knowledge before passing forward, trained on only a fraction of the dataset with minimal supervision.

Result: Outperforms existing supervised methods across four otoscopic imaging datasets, with cumulative accuracy gains up to +23% over single backbone trained on same limited data, and generalizes well to other medical imaging modalities.

Conclusion: WeCKD redefines knowledge transfer through structured sequential learning, reducing data dependency and mitigating limitations of one-step KD, showing strong potential for real-world adoption in medical imaging.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static
teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers
knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer
from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a
very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their
effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we
present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that
redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected
models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,
where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the
knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further
enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the
limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on
only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be
achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic
imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases
surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results
on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse
medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance
imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of
up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which
highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

TL;DR: VTimeCoT is a training-free framework that enhances video temporal grounding and reasoning in multimodal LLMs by integrating progress bar tools and visuotemporal chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have deficiencies in video temporal grounding and reasoning, limiting their effectiveness for real-world video understanding systems. The approach is inspired by how humans use video players and progress bars for comprehension.

Method: The framework incorporates two novel visual tools: plug-and-play progress bar integration and high-efficiency highlighting. It also introduces visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across video and text, addressing limitations of text-only CoT approaches.

Result: Significant performance improvements on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in video temporal grounding and reasoning-based question answering tasks. The framework achieves compositional and interpretable reasoning processes.

Conclusion: VTimeCoT provides an effective training-free solution for enhancing video temporal grounding and reasoning in MLLMs through progress bar tools and visuotemporal chain-of-thought reasoning, demonstrating improved performance and interpretability.

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language
models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the
substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable
deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing
challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding
systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress
bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective
training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and
reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the
progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a
high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of
conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a
visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both
video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements
on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and
reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed
framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project

*Seungjoo Shin,Jaesik Park,Sunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3DGS compression framework that uses learned image priors to restore compression artifacts, improving rate-distortion performance while maintaining high rendering quality with less storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS compression methods lack learned priors, limiting further advances in rate-distortion trade-off despite achieving considerable storage reduction.

Method: Builds upon initially compressed Gaussians and uses a restoration network to model compression artifacts in image space. Incorporates coarse rendering residuals as side information and refines compressed Gaussians through restored image supervision.

Result: Superior rate-distortion performance compared to state-of-the-art 3DGS compression methods, with enhanced rendering quality and substantially less storage requirement.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages learned image priors to recover compression-induced quality degradation and is compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it broadly applicable.

Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently
achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians
while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage
reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the
rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful
representational capacity of learned image priors to recover
compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed
Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts
in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the
rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the
restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of
restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly
compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is
designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it
broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion
performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS
compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

*Caleb Robinson,Kimberly T. Goetz,Christin B. Khan,Meredith Sackett,Kathleen Leonard,Rahul Dodhia,Juan M. Lavista Ferres*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-automated system using statistical anomaly detection to identify potential whales in satellite imagery, reducing expert review area by up to 99.8% while maintaining high recall rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional whale monitoring methods are expensive and difficult to scale, while automated detection faces challenges due to lack of annotated data, image variability, and pipeline costs.

Method: Uses statistical anomaly detection to flag spatial outliers as 'interesting points', combined with a web-based labeling interface for expert annotation, without requiring labeled training data.

Result: Achieved recalls of 90.3% to 96.4% on benchmark scenes, reducing expert inspection area from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km (up to 99.8% reduction).

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable first step for machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space and has been open-sourced.

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open
sourced this pipeline at https://github.com/microsoft/whales.

*Dingzhou Xie,Rushi Lan,Cheng Pang,Enhao Ning,Jiahao Zeng,Wei Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CFSAM, a cross-layer feature self-attention module that models multi-scale dependencies to improve object detection performance on SSD300 framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention mechanisms are limited to single or dual-layer features, missing rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale representations needed for detecting objects with large scale variations.

Method: CFSAM consists of three components: convolutional local feature extractor, Transformer-based global modeling unit for cross-layer interactions, and feature fusion mechanism to enhance original representations.

Result: Integrated into SSD300, CFSAM achieves 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO (vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules while accelerating convergence without substantial computational overhead.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the importance of explicit cross-layer attention modeling for advancing multi-scale object detection.

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

TL;DR: ImageNet-F benchmark enables hierarchical image classification with mixed-granularity supervision, simulating real-world annotation behavior using CLIP to measure semantic ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hierarchical classification methods assume complete fine-grained annotations, but real-world supervision varies in granularity due to factors like image quality and annotator expertise.

Method: Propose free-grain learning with heterogeneous supervision, using CLIP to simulate realistic mixed-granularity labels. Enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning.

Result: Developed methods and strong baselines substantially improve performance under mixed supervision conditions.

Conclusion: The ImageNet-F benchmark and proposed methods advance hierarchical classification under real-world constraints with varying annotation granularity.

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy,
but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an
assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in
granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task
demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald
eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet
and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained
levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic,
mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose
free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We
develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from
vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These,
along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed
supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical
classification under real-world constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build transparent and trustworthy AI systems by understanding and explaining machine learning model behavior, especially for visual classifiers.

Method: Optimizes text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that strongly activate target classifiers, then uses these synthetic samples to generate natural language reports describing class-specific decision patterns and biases.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting across ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces datasets, producing accurate and interpretable outputs.

Conclusion: DEXTER provides an effective data-free solution for generating natural language explanations of visual classifiers' decision processes and biases.

Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightQANet introduces quantized and adaptive feature learning for low-light image enhancement, using Light Quantization Module for structured illumination factor extraction and Light-Aware Prompt Module for dynamic adaptation to varying lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLIE methods struggle with reliable feature extraction due to severely degraded pixel-level information in low-light conditions, leading to poor texture restoration, color inconsistency, and artifacts.

Method: Proposes LightQANet with two key components: Light Quantization Module (LQM) for explicit illumination factor quantification and structured learning, and Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM) using learnable prompts to dynamically guide feature adaptation to lighting conditions.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show state-of-the-art performance with superior qualitative and quantitative results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed quantized and adaptive feature learning approach effectively addresses illumination challenges in low-light enhancement, achieving consistent and robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing
lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments
on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative
results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

*Giuseppe Lorenzo Catalano,Agata Marta Soccini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an unconditional diffusion model for reconstructing Martian terrain heightmaps with missing data, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Space exploration relies on accurate 3D planetary terrain representations, but Mars heightmaps often contain missing values that current interpolation methods fail to reconstruct with geometric coherence.

Method: Uses an unconditional diffusion model trained on 12,000 augmented Martian heightmaps from NASA HiRISE data, with non-homogeneous rescaling to capture multi-scale terrain features before resizing to 128x128 resolution.

Result: Outperforms established methods (Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, Navier-Stokes) with 4-15% improvement in RMSE and 29-81% improvement in LPIPS perceptual similarity on 1,000 evaluation samples.

Conclusion: The diffusion-based approach provides superior Martian surface reconstruction compared to traditional void-filling techniques, enabling more reliable simulations for space exploration applications.

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

TL;DR: A novel visual communication framework for MAV swarms using motion-based signaling inspired by honeybee waggle dance, employing event cameras and SNNs for energy-efficient communication in constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional radio-based communication in MAV swarms suffers from spectrum congestion, jamming, and high power consumption, necessitating alternative communication methods.

Method: MAVs convey information through deliberate flight patterns captured by event cameras, using four motion primitives as control symbols. An event frame-based segmentation model and lightweight SNN are designed for decoding, combined with an integrated decoding algorithm.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate accurate decoding and low power consumption, validating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed visual communication framework offers a promising energy-efficient alternative for MAV communication in constrained environments.

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

TL;DR: CoT-PL introduces chain-of-thought reasoning into pseudo-labeling for open-vocabulary object detection, achieving significant improvements in crowded and occluded scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVD methods rely on direct image-text matching but fail to handle semantically complex scenes with crowded or occluded objects, lacking intermediate reasoning steps.

Method: Uses structured visual chain-of-thought reasoning with three steps: region perception, category recognition via zero-shot reasoning, and background grounding. Also introduces contrastive background learning (CBL) for feature disentanglement.

Result: Achieves 103.4% and 168.4% relative improvements in novel-class pseudo-label quality for crowded and occluded scenes respectively. Sets new SOTA with +7.7 AP50 on COCO and +2.9 mask AP on LVIS for novel classes.

Conclusion: CoT-PL demonstrates that integrating structured reasoning into pseudo-labeling significantly enhances OVD performance, especially in challenging visual contexts.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object
categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically
leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using
image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes
without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct
image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for
interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness
when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we
introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL
decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region
perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot
reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex
objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive
background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as
negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In
this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust
pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,
our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%
and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9
mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

*Usama Sajjad,Abdul Rehman Akbar,Ziyu Su,Deborah Knight,Wendy L. Frankel,Metin N. Gurcan,Wei Chen,Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is an interpretable AI model for colorectal cancer prognosis that captures continuous morphological variability, achieving superior 5-year overall survival prediction (AUC=0.70) and outperforming existing methods by 15-23% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models in computational pathology overlook organ-specific morphological patterns crucial for understanding tumor behavior and patient outcomes in colorectal cancer, which remains a major global health burden.

Method: PRISM incorporates continuous variability spectrum within distinct morphologies to characterize phenotypic diversity, trained on 8.74 million histological images from 424 stage III CRC patients' surgical resection specimens.

Result: PRISM achieved superior prognostic performance for five-year OS (AUC=0.70±0.04; accuracy=68.37%±4.75%; HR=3.34; p<0.0001), outperforming CRC-specific methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy, with sex-agnostic robustness and stable performance across subgroups.

Conclusion: PRISM successfully captures incremental evolutionary processes in tumor morphology, providing an interpretable AI framework that reflects the continuous nature of malignant transformation and demonstrates robust prognostic capabilities across diverse patient populations.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally,
with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated
for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational
pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can
overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct
biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior,
therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop
a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated
Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within
each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting
the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental
evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained
on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens
of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic
performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%;
HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific
methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed
sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable
performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy
fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens,
replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between
treatments.

TL;DR: R-Super trains AI models to segment tumors using medical reports instead of manual tumor masks, achieving comparable performance to mask-trained models while enabling segmentation of previously unsupported tumor types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tumor mask creation for AI training is costly and time-consuming, while medical reports containing tumor descriptions are abundant and underutilized in clinical practice.

Method: R-Super trains AI models to segment tumors that match descriptions in medical reports, using a dataset of 101,654 reports to scale training without extensive manual mask annotation.

Result: Models trained with R-Super achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks, with combined reports and masks improving sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%, surpassing radiologists in detecting 5 of 7 tumor types.

Conclusion: R-Super challenges the necessity of labor-intensive tumor mask creation and establishes a scalable path for early tumor detection across diverse tumor types, including previously unsupported organs.

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

### [74] [Unifying Environment Perception and Route Choice Modeling for Trajectory Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14819)
*Ji Cao,Yu Wang,Tongya Zheng,Zujie Ren,Canghong Jin,Gang Chen,Mingli Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRTraj is a novel trajectory representation learning framework that integrates environment perception and route choice modeling to create more effective trajectory embeddings for downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory representation learning methods treat trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences without considering external environmental factors and internal route choice behaviors that shape trajectory formation.

Method: PRTraj uses an Environment Perception Module to capture multi-granularity environmental semantics from POI distributions, and a Route Choice Encoder that models road segment transitions as decision sequences to capture route choice behavior.

Result: Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5 downstream tasks show PRTraj's effectiveness, generalizability, and strong data efficiency with robust performance in few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: PRTraj successfully bridges the gap in trajectory representation learning by incorporating both environmental context and route choice behavior, demonstrating superior performance across multiple tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes fractional bits quantization (SHORT) to progressively reduce model precision from 32 to 4 bits while maintaining generation quality, enabling deployment on smartphones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large generative models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to memory and computation constraints, and aggressive quantization methods struggle to preserve model quality.

Method: Progressive precision reduction from 32 to 4 bits per parameter with fractional bits optimization during training to maintain generation quality.

Result: SHORT achieves improved quality on various diffusion models (SD3.5-Medium, Sana, PixArt, FLUX.1-schnell) with 4-7% lower FiD than standard QAT, and successfully runs Sana on Samsung S25U smartphone.

Conclusion: Fractional bits quantization enables efficient deployment of generative models on mobile devices while preserving generation quality.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity
model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the
limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods
lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient
computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses
efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains
a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose
a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple
yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4
bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to
maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved
quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana,
\pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard
QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the
Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).

TL;DR: Synthetic data can match AI tumor segmentation performance with fewer real scans. AbdomenAtlas 2.0 provides 10,135 CT scans with 15,130 tumor instances across six organs, achieving +7-16% DSC improvements over public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise annotated datasets that require medical experts. The authors found diminishing returns with real data alone after 1,500 scans.

Method: Created AbdomenAtlas 2.0 - a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with 15,130 tumor instances manually annotated by 23 expert radiologists across six organs (pancreas, liver, kidney, colon, esophagus, uterus) plus 5,893 control scans.

Result: With synthetic data, achieved same performance using only 500 real scans instead of 1,500. AbdomenAtlas 2.0 achieves +7% DSC gain on in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests compared to public datasets.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more efficient model training than real data alone. AbdomenAtlas 2.0 provides a strong foundation for training AI to segment tumors across multiple organs.

Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise
annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In
our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found
that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data,
we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding
suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more
efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we
created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130
tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver,
kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23
expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing
public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current
version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on
lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs.
It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on
in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QDepth-VLA enhances VLA models with depth prediction to improve spatial reasoning for manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models lack 3D understanding for precise control in manipulation tasks.

Method: Augments VLA models with auxiliary depth prediction using quantized latent tokens from VQ-VAE encoder.

Result: Strong spatial reasoning and competitive performance on simulation benchmarks and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: QDepth-VLA effectively improves spatial perception in VLA models through depth-aware representations.

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing
approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential
3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we
propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an
auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to
predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder,
enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical
geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and
real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning
and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: ImagerySearch is a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that dynamically adjusts inference search space and reward function for better video generation in imaginative scenarios with long-distance semantic relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation models perform poorly in imaginative scenarios with rarely co-occurring concepts and long-distance semantic relationships that fall outside training distributions. Existing test-time scaling methods have fixed search spaces and static rewards that limit adaptability.

Method: Proposed ImagerySearch - a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that dynamically adjusts both inference search space and reward function according to semantic relationships in the prompt. Also introduced LDT-Bench benchmark with 2,839 diverse concept pairs for evaluating long-distance semantic prompts.

Result: ImagerySearch consistently outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse prompt types.

Conclusion: The proposed ImagerySearch method effectively addresses the challenge of imaginative video generation by dynamically adapting search strategies based on prompt semantics, and the LDT-Bench provides a valuable evaluation framework for future research in this direction.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly
excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably
in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring
concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training
distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving
video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit
adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose
ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that
dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function
according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent
and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate
progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated
benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse
concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation
capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently
outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling
approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,
demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release
LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video

### [79] [A Multi-Task Deep Learning Framework for Skin Lesion Classification, ABCDE Feature Quantification, and Evolution Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14855)
*Harsha Kotla,Arun Kumar Rajasekaran,Hannah Rana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework that classifies skin lesions and quantifies ABCD features (Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter) while simulating evolution for the E feature, achieving 89% accuracy and 0.96 AUC for melanoma detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early melanoma detection is crucial for survival rates, but current deep learning approaches treat skin lesion analysis as a black box without explaining human-interpretable ABCDE features used in clinical practice.

Method: Proposed framework classifies skin lesions and quantifies scores for each ABCD feature, simulates feature evolution over time for the E aspect, and visualizes feature trajectories in latent space from benign to malignant lesions using the HAM10000 dataset.

Result: Achieved 89% classification accuracy with melanoma AUC of 0.96. Feature evaluation performed well for asymmetry, color variation, and diameter prediction, though border irregularity remained more challenging to model.

Conclusion: The framework enables doctors to link machine learning diagnoses to clinically relevant ABCDE criteria, improving understanding of skin cancer progression and bridging the gap between AI and clinical practice.

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
skin cancer progression.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to combine multiple visual modalities using minimal human supervision through pre-trained experts and procedural combinations on raw videos, achieving competitive results with a highly efficient model (<1M parameters) compared to much larger models (~300M parameters).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The real world is inherently multi-modal, but traditional ML models are unimodal or bi-modal. To truly understand the world, all independent modalities need to be integrated with minimal human supervision.

Method: Uses pre-trained experts and procedural combinations on raw videos through a fully autonomous data-pipeline, leveraging PHG-MAE model designed for multi-modal data, with efficient distillation into low-parameter models.

Result: Achieved competitive results with a highly efficient model (<1M parameters) compared to models of ~300M parameters, enabling real-time semantic segmentation on commodity hardware and near real-time depth estimation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully demonstrates efficient multi-modal integration with minimal supervision, enabling practical deployment of real-time computer vision tasks on consumer hardware.

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and
take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much
of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,
languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine
Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->
sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same
framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

Motivation: To evaluate and compare the performance of open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with existing face recognition models on standard benchmarks, as their potential in face recognition remains underexplored.

Method: Conducted systematic benchmarking of state-of-the-art MLLMs on several face recognition datasets including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP, AgeDB and RFW using similar protocols as existing models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Free-Form HOI Generation to create diverse hand-object interactions beyond fixed grasping patterns, using a multi-level diffusion model with fine-grained semantic control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI generation research is limited to fixed grasping patterns tied to physical priors, failing to capture the diversity of daily hand-object interactions like pushing, poking, and rotating.

Method: Proposes TOUCH, a three-stage framework with a multi-level diffusion model that uses explicit contact modeling for conditioning, refined with contact consistency and physical constraints. Built on WildO2 dataset containing 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents and 610 object categories.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the method's ability to generate controllable, diverse, and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

Conclusion: The approach successfully extends HOI generation from grasping to free-form interactions, enabling fine-grained semantic control and diverse hand poses beyond traditional grasping priors.

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

TL;DR: BADAS is a family of ego-centric collision prediction models that distinguishes between ego-vehicle threats and random accidents, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing false alerts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing collision prediction methods fail to distinguish between ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment.

Method: BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end, with two variants: BADAS-Open (trained on 1.5k public videos) and BADAS1.0 (trained on 40k proprietary videos). The approach involves re-annotating major benchmarks to identify ego involvement, adding consensus alert-time labels, and synthesizing negatives where needed.

Result: BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and Nexar datasets, outperforms forward-collision ADAS baseline, and produces more realistic time-to-accident estimates.

Conclusion: The authors release BADAS-Open model weights, code, and re-annotations of all evaluation datasets to promote ego-centric collision prediction research.

Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between
ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading
to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment. We present BADAS, a family

*Keli Liu,Zhendong Wang,Wengang Zhou,Shaodong Xu,Ruixiao Dong,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScaleWeaver is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that enables precise control in visual autoregressive (VAR) text-to-image models through Reference Attention modules, achieving high-fidelity generation with improved efficiency over diffusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VAR models have shown impressive advances in text-to-image generation, control mechanisms remain underexplored compared to diffusion models. There's a need to bridge this gap and enable precise, flexible control within the VAR paradigm.

Method: Proposes ScaleWeaver with improved MMDiT blocks featuring Reference Attention modules that efficiently incorporate conditional information. The method discards unnecessary image→condition attention, emphasizes parameter reuse, and uses zero-initialized linear projection to preserve base model capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments show ScaleWeaver delivers high-quality generation with precise control while achieving superior efficiency over diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: ScaleWeaver provides a practical and effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual autoregressive paradigm, balancing quality, control precision, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently
achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.
While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling
precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To
bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel
framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon
advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in
ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention
module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.
Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards
the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing
computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it
strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR
backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control
information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that
control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative
capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver
delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior
efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and
effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual
autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

*Logan Lawrence,Oindrila Saha,Megan Wei,Chen Sun,Subhransu Maji,Grant Van Horn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage method called nlg2choice that improves zero-shot visual classification by first generating free-form responses from MLLMs and then using constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice, addressing challenges in fine-grained visual classification with hundreds to thousands of highly related options.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating free-form responses from auto-regressive models in zero-shot visual classification, particularly in fine-grained visual classification where choice counts are high (hundreds to thousands) and choices are highly related, and to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems efficiently.

Method: nlg2choice - a simple two-stage method: 1) Ask MLLM an open-ended question with minimal constraints, 2) Use text-only constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. For retrieval settings, compute probability of constrained response with early stopping to improve throughput.

Result: Shows improvement over seven fine-grained visual datasets in both classification and retrieval tasks, with performance holding across various natural language task implementations by LLM users.

Conclusion: The nlg2choice method effectively addresses challenges in zero-shot visual classification for fine-grained tasks with large choice sets, demonstrating robust performance across different evaluation scenarios and natural language implementations.

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

*Furkan Mumcu,Michael J. Jones,Anoop Cherian,Yasin Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised video anomaly detection framework using Multimodal Large Language Models to analyze object activities and interactions over time, providing explainable anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAD methods struggle with detecting complex object interaction anomalies and lack explainability, motivating the use of MLLMs for better interpretation.

Method: Query MLLMs with visual inputs of object pairs across time to generate textual descriptions of activities and interactions from normal videos, then compare test videos against these descriptions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, effectively detects complex interaction-based anomalies, and works well even on datasets without interaction anomalies.

Conclusion: The MLLM-based approach provides explainable anomaly detection, can be combined with traditional methods for enhanced interpretability, and handles both interaction-based and general anomalies effectively.

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle
with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally
lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous
MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level,
our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and
interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs
at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and
interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a
high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a
video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to
textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently
provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods
to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based
anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets without interaction anomalies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MaskCaptioner, an end-to-end model for Dense Video Object Captioning that jointly detects, segments, tracks and captions object trajectories using synthetic captions from extended datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches use disjoint training strategies due to the complexity and high cost of manual annotation for DVOC, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Generate synthetic captions using a state-of-the-art VLM, extend LVIS and LV-VIS datasets with these captions (creating LVISCap and LV-VISCap), and train MaskCaptioner end-to-end on these datasets.

Result: MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three benchmarks: VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT.

Conclusion: The proposed approach with synthetic caption generation and end-to-end training effectively addresses DVOC challenges and achieves superior performance.

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting,
tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability
to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language.
Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual
annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies,
potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities
leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets
with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an
end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and
captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and
LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three
existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are
available at https://www.gabriel.fiastre.fr/maskcaptioner/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DScenePrompt is a framework for generating video chunks with precise camera control and scene consistency using dual spatio-temporal conditioning and a 3D scene memory that separates static geometry from dynamic elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are limited to single image or short clip conditioning, lacking long-range scene consistency and precise camera control when generating video sequences beyond temporal boundaries.

Method: Uses dual spatio-temporal conditioning with temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent content for scene consistency. Introduces a 3D scene memory built via dynamic SLAM with dynamic masking to separate static geometry from moving elements, enabling geometrically consistent warped views.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods in scene consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality while maintaining computational efficiency and motion realism.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control for video generation by leveraging 3D scene memory and dual conditioning strategies.

Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk
from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and
preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer with gated linear attention and RMSNorm for whole-body multi-modal human motion generation, integrating text, speech, and music modalities using DiT structure with AdaLN and cross-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in whole-body multi-modal human motion generation: creating effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various modalities (text, speech, music) into cohesive framework.

Method: Continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer with causal attention, gated linear attention, RMSNorm module, DiT structure for condition diffusion, and AdaLN/cross-attention for multimodal fusion.

Result: Outperforms previous methods across all modalities including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles multi-modal human motion generation with superior performance across different modalities.

Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges:
creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various
modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike
previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive
modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer,
where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within
the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear
attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention
to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal
movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To
further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization,
we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer
towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention
are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all
modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.
The code of our method will be made public.

TL;DR: RealDPO is a novel alignment paradigm that uses real-world videos as positive samples for preference learning to improve complex motion synthesis in video generation, addressing the gap between generated and real-world motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generative models struggle with producing natural, smooth, and contextually consistent complex motions, limiting their practical applicability. The gap between generated and real-world motions needs to be addressed.

Method: RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a tailored loss function, using real-world videos as positive samples and contrasting them with erroneous model outputs for iterative self-correction. Also introduces RealAction-5K dataset for post-training.

Result: Extensive experiments show RealDPO significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization techniques.

Conclusion: RealDPO effectively addresses complex motion synthesis challenges by leveraging real-world data for preference learning, enabling more accurate and realistic video generation.

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

TL;DR: MathCanvas is a framework that enables Large Multimodal Models to perform Visual Chain-of-Thought reasoning for mathematics through diagram generation and strategic visual-textual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that require visual aids, and existing VCoT approaches are limited by rigid tools or poor diagram quality.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Visual Manipulation pre-training on 15.2M caption-to-diagram pairs and editing trajectories, 2) Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning fine-tuning on 219K interleaved visual-textual reasoning examples.

Result: BAGEL-Canvas model achieves 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on MathCanvas-Bench and shows excellent generalization to other math benchmarks.

Conclusion: MathCanvas provides a complete toolkit to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs for mathematical problem-solving.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

*Shizun Wang,Zhenxiang Jiang,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C4D is a framework that extends 3D reconstruction to 4D (dynamic scenes) by leveraging temporal correspondences including optical flow and point tracking, enabling joint estimation of dynamic geometry and camera poses from monocular video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D reconstruction methods like DUSt3R work well for static scenes but fail with dynamic scenes because moving objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, leading to inaccurate reconstructions.

Method: C4D captures short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking, trains a dynamic-aware point tracker to identify moving objects via motion masks, and introduces dynamic scene optimization objectives to recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters while lifting 2D trajectories to smooth 3D trajectories.

Result: The framework achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across multiple downstream tasks including depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and point tracking.

Conclusion: C4D successfully extends 3D reconstruction to dynamic scenes by incorporating temporal correspondences, enabling robust 4D reconstruction from monocular video.

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel diffusion-based precipitation nowcasting method that integrates token-wise attention into both U-Net and spatio-temporal encoder to capture multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches without requiring separate latent modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing diffusion-based precipitation nowcasting models that suffer from scalability issues - latent-space approaches require separate autoencoders adding complexity, while pixel-space approaches are computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies.

Method: Proposes token-wise attention integrated into both the U-Net diffusion model and spatio-temporal encoder to dynamically capture multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution, eliminating the need for separate latent modules while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex precipitation forecasting scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed token-wise attention integration provides an effective solution for precipitation nowcasting that captures both large-scale motion and fine-grained stochastic variability while being computationally efficient and eliminating the need for complex separate modules.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic
and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent
advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
precipitation forecasting scenarios.

TL;DR: Introduces ChangingGrounding benchmark for 3D visual grounding in changing scenes with memory-driven approach, and proposes Mem-ChangingGrounder method that achieves high localization accuracy with reduced exploration cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DVG methods assume static, reconstructed point clouds requiring costly re-scans, which hinders real-world deployment. The paper argues 3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem for practical applications.

Method: Proposes Mem-ChangingGrounder: a zero-shot method combining cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion. It identifies object type from query, retrieves relevant memories to guide actions, explores target efficiently, performs multi-view scanning, and projects fused evidence to get accurate bounding boxes.

Result: Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy on the ChangingGrounding benchmark while greatly reducing exploration cost compared to other baselines.

Conclusion: The benchmark and method aim to catalyze a shift toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications where scenes keep changing.

Abstract: Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while
scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding
(3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an
assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that
3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce
ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an
agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still
deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point,
we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that
marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies
the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide
actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when
previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target,
and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object
bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our
Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly
reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift
toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the copy-paste problem in identity-consistent text-to-image generation by introducing a large-scale dataset, a new benchmark, and a contrastive training approach that balances identity fidelity with natural variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current identity-consistent generation models suffer from copy-paste artifacts where they directly replicate reference faces instead of preserving identity across natural variations in pose, expression, and lighting, which limits controllability and expressive power.

Method: Constructed MultiID-2M dataset for multi-person scenarios, introduced a benchmark to quantify copy-paste artifacts, and proposed a novel training paradigm with contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data to balance fidelity with diversity.

Result: WithAnyone model significantly reduces copy-paste artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, maintains strong perceptual quality, and achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable generation as validated by user studies.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively mitigates copy-paste problems in identity-consistent generation while preserving identity similarity and enabling more expressive and controllable image generation.

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

TL;DR: Ponimator is a framework that uses close-proximity human-human interactive poses to generate versatile interaction animations through two conditional diffusion models for motion generation and pose synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human interactive poses convey rich contextual information about interaction dynamics, and humans can intuitively infer context and anticipate dynamics from such poses. The goal is to leverage these strong priors for interaction animation.

Method: Uses two conditional diffusion models: (1) pose animator that generates dynamic motion sequences from interactive poses using temporal prior, and (2) pose generator that synthesizes interactive poses from single pose, text, or both using spatial prior.

Result: Empirical experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and the effectiveness and robustness of the framework in supporting image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction synthesis.

Conclusion: Ponimator successfully transfers interaction knowledge from high-quality mocap data to open-world scenarios, enabling versatile interaction animation through interactive pose priors.

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

Method: Proposes P2G-VAE that encodes 3D inputs into latent point representation and decodes as 3D Gaussian primitives, plus SPFlow network for generating latent point representation by denoising positions and features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction and generation on ScanNet v2 indoor scenes with high 3D consistency, enabling exact multi-view consistency and flexible rendering from any viewpoint.

Conclusion: Terra demonstrates that native 3D representation and architecture enable explorable world modeling with superior 3D consistency compared to pixel-aligned approaches.

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of
the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned
representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D
nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and
diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present
Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable
environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel
point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into
a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian
primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse
point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point
representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the
point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D
representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any
viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves
explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent
space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from
ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction
and generation with high 3D consistency.

*Nupur Kumari,Sheng-Yu Wang,Nanxuan Zhao,Yotam Nitzan,Yuheng Li,Krishna Kumar Singh,Richard Zhang,Eli Shechtman,Jun-Yan Zhu,Xun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new training paradigm for image editing that eliminates the need for paired data by using vision-language models for direct feedback and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image editing models rely on supervised fine-tuning with large datasets of input-target pairs, which are hard to curate at scale. Synthetic training pairs can propagate artifacts from pretrained models.

Method: Directly optimizes few-step diffusion models by unrolling during training and using VLM feedback. VLMs evaluate if edits follow instructions and preserve unchanged content, providing gradients for optimization. Incorporates distribution matching loss (DMD) for visual fidelity.

Result: Performs on par with supervised diffusion models trained on extensive paired data, and outperforms RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO when using the same VLM as reward model.

Conclusion: The method successfully eliminates the need for paired training data while achieving competitive performance through direct optimization with VLM feedback and distribution constraints.

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NEO, a family of native Vision-Language Models that address fundamental constraints of modular VLMs by developing unified vision-language encoding, alignment, and reasoning capabilities within a single model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of modular VLMs and democratize native VLM research by clarifying fundamental constraints and providing accessible building blocks for native vision-language integration.

Method: Developed NEO family of native VLMs using first principles with three key primitives: pixel-word alignment in shared semantic space, integration of vision and language module strengths, and inherent cross-modal properties for unified encoding, aligning, and reasoning.

Result: NEO achieves performance comparable to top-tier modular VLMs across diverse real-world scenarios using only 390M image-text examples, efficiently developing visual perception from scratch while mitigating vision-language conflicts.

Conclusion: NEO serves as a scalable foundation for native VLMs with reusable components that create a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem for advancing vision-language research.

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising
contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and
training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread
exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs
apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and
models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

*Hadi Alzayer,Yunzhi Zhang,Chen Geng,Jia-Bin Huang,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion sampling method for multi-view consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D models, achieving consistency across views without explicit 3D optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D image editing models produce high-quality edits but lack consistency across multi-view images, while 3D optimization approaches suffer from lengthy processes and instability with sparse views.

Method: Implicit 3D regularization using coupled diffusion sampling that concurrently samples from multi-view and 2D edited image distributions with a coupling term to enforce consistency.

Result: Validated effectiveness across three multi-view image editing tasks, showing applicability across various model architectures.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential as a general solution for multi-view consistent editing without requiring explicit 3D optimization.

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view
image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model
architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for
multi-view consistent editing.

TL;DR: A semantic inference pipeline using instruction-tuned LLMs achieves high-accuracy IoT device identification from noisy network metadata by treating it as a language modeling task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IoT device identification methods struggle with incomplete, noisy, or obfuscated metadata in open-world environments, creating security and privacy risks.

Method: Generate high-fidelity vendor labels using LLM ensemble with mutual-information and entropy-based stability scores, then instruction-tune quantized LLaMA3.18B with curriculum learning.

Result: Achieves 98.25% top-1 accuracy and 90.73% macro accuracy across 2,015 vendors, with resilience to missing fields, protocol drift, and adversarial manipulation.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuned LLMs provide a scalable and interpretable foundation for real-world IoT device identification at scale.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT devices has outpaced current identification
methods, creating significant risks for security, privacy, and network
accountability. These challenges are heightened in open-world environments,
where traffic metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or intentionally obfuscated.
We introduce a semantic inference pipeline that reframes device identification
as a language modeling task over heterogeneous network metadata. To construct
reliable supervision, we generate high-fidelity vendor labels for the IoT
Inspector dataset, the largest real-world IoT traffic corpus, using an ensemble
of large language models guided by mutual-information and entropy-based
stability scores. We then instruction-tune a quantized LLaMA3.18B model with
curriculum learning to support generalization under sparsity and long-tail
vendor distributions. Our model achieves 98.25% top-1 accuracy and 90.73% macro
accuracy across 2,015 vendors while maintaining resilience to missing fields,
protocol drift, and adversarial manipulation. Evaluation on an independent IoT
testbed, coupled with explanation quality and adversarial stress tests,
demonstrates that instruction-tuned LLMs provide a scalable and interpretable
foundation for real-world device identification at scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STDW enhances gradual domain adaptation through dynamic weighting that balances source and target domain losses, using a time-varying parameter to ensure stable knowledge migration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GDA methods suffer from inefficient knowledge migration and incomplete intermediate data, limiting their robustness in handling domain shifts.

Method: Self-training with dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances source and target domain losses using a time-varying hyperparameter ρ, combined with pseudo-label generation and iterative optimization.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and Cover Type dataset. Ablation studies confirm the importance of dynamic scheduling of ρ.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical insights and practical framework for robust gradual domain adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic
Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation
(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source
to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through
intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient
knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a
dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of
the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an
optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$
(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific
learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to
generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for
iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.
Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the
Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic
scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in
reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both
theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain
adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The

Conclusion: The Deep Edge Filter effectively improves model generalizability by filtering out domain-specific biases through high-pass filtering of deep features, with empirical validation of the core hypothesis.

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoLoR-GAN introduces a framework for continual few-shot learning in GANs using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce parameter requirements while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA methods like LFS-GAN require adding significant new weights at each training iteration, which becomes problematic for long-term continual learning. There's a need for more parameter-efficient approaches.

Method: Uses low-rank tensors to adapt GAN models to target tasks, implements vanilla LoRA, introduces LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) for convolutional layers to optimize adapter size, and provides empirical hyperparameter selection.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance with significantly reduced computational resources compared to existing methods, demonstrating effectiveness on benchmark CL and FS tasks.

Conclusion: CoLoR-GAN provides an efficient solution for continual few-shot learning in GANs by leveraging low-rank adaptation techniques, substantially reducing parameter requirements while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) remains a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to learn from
a few-shot (FS) samples without catastrophic forgetting. Current most effective
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, like LFS-GAN, introduce a non-negligible
quantity of new weights at each training iteration, which would become
significant when considering the long term. For this reason, this paper
introduces \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{c}}}ontinual
few-sh\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{o}}}t learning with
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{lo}}}w-\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{r}}}ank
adaptation in GANs named CoLoR-GAN, a framework designed to handle both FS and
CL together, leveraging low-rank tensors to efficiently adapt the model to
target tasks while reducing even more the number of parameters required.
Applying a vanilla LoRA implementation already permitted us to obtain pretty
good results. In order to optimize even further the size of the adapters, we
challenged LoRA limits introducing a LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) technique for
convolutional layers. Finally, aware of the criticality linked to the choice of
the hyperparameters of LoRA, we provide an empirical study to easily find the
best ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLoR-GAN through experiments on
several benchmark CL and FS tasks and show that our model is efficient,
reaching SOTA performance but with a number of resources enormously reduced.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel training framework that integrates adversarial training principles to achieve both robust classification and high-fidelity generative modeling in a single model, overcoming limitations of previous Joint Energy-Based Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative modeling in a single framework, overcoming limitations of SGLD-based training in Joint Energy-Based Models which suffer from instability and poor sample quality.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) Replace SGLD-based JEM learning with stable AT-based approach using BCE loss to discriminate between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples; (2) Synergistic adversarial training for discriminative component to enhance robustness without gradient penalties; (3) Two-stage training procedure to resolve batch normalization and EBM training incompatibility.

Result: Substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, generative fidelity surpasses BigGAN and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets.

Conclusion: The approach addresses key stability issues limiting JEM scaling and demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for unified frameworks capable of both generating and robustly classifying visual data.

Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative
modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid
approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as
EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent
in SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel
training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for
both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed
method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM
learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by
discriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using
the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative
component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need
for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to
resolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method
substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while
maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for
generative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN
and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach
to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our
approach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and
demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for
unified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: K-frames is a scene-driven keyframe selection method for long-video understanding that predicts semantically coherent clips instead of individual frames, enabling flexible any-k keyframe selection while preserving temporal continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with long videos due to context window limitations and computational costs. Current keyframe selection methods produce sparse, disjointed frames that lose scene continuity and lack multi-scale flexibility.

Method: Three-stage progressive curriculum: 1) Supervised Fine-Tuning for temporal grounding, 2) Supervised Fine-Tuning for key-clip perception, 3) Reinforcement Learning to optimize scene-driven prediction policy without additional annotations. Built on PeakClips dataset of 200K query-conditioned video highlights.

Result: Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks show K-frames provides effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play keyframe selection at various scales.

Conclusion: K-frames offers a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe selection that preserves temporal continuity and enables flexible any-k frame selection, addressing limitations of existing methods for long-video understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in image understanding, but long-video are constrained by context
windows and computational cost. Uniform frame sampling often leads to
substantial information loss. Meanwhile existing keyframe selection methods
such as text-frame retrieval or RL-based frame optimization typically yield
sparse and temporally disjointed frames, overlooking scene continuity and
lacking flexibility for multi-scale frame selection. To address these
limitations, we introduce K-frames, a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe
selection that preserves temporal continuity. Instead of selecting individual
frames, K-frames predicts semantically coherent, query-relevant clips, which
enables any-k keyframes selection to meet diverse user budgets. To achieve this
approach, we first introduce PeakClips, a dataset of 200K video highlights
conditioned by query. Building on this dataset, K-frames learns clip2frame
selection using a three-stage progressive curriculum. It involves two
Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception,
followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that directly optimizes the
scene-driven prediction policy for downstream task without further annotations.
Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate
that K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution
for keyframe selection at various scales. Our dataset and model will be
available.

*Yanshan Xiao,Kaihong Wu,Bo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MVSS-LDL is a novel multi-view semi-supervised label distribution learning approach that exploits local nearest neighbor structure complementarity across multiple views for improved classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing label distribution learning methods only address single-view problems with labeled data, leaving multi-view scenarios with both labeled and unlabeled data unexplored.

Method: The approach computes k-nearest neighbors for each view, then complements each view's neighbor set by incorporating neighbors from other views, and constructs a graph learning-based multi-view semi-supervised LDL model.

Result: Numerical studies show MVSS-LDL achieves significantly better classification performance than existing single-view LDL methods.

Conclusion: This represents the first attempt at multi-view label distribution learning, demonstrating that leveraging local structure complementarity across views improves learning performance.

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a paradigm that each sample is
associated with a label distribution. At present, the existing approaches are
proposed for the single-view LDL problem with labeled data, while the
multi-view LDL problem with labeled and unlabeled data has not been considered.
In this paper, we put forward the multi-view semi-supervised label distribution
learning with local structure complementarity (MVSS-LDL) approach, which
exploits the local nearest neighbor structure of each view and emphasizes the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures in multiple views.
Specifically speaking, we first explore the local structure of view $v$ by
computing the $k$-nearest neighbors. As a result, the $k$-nearest neighbor set
of each sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ in view $v$ is attained. Nevertheless, this
$k$-nearest neighbor set describes only a part of the nearest neighbor
information of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$. In order to obtain a more
comprehensive description of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors, we
complement the nearest neighbor set in view $v$ by incorporating sample
$\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors in other views. Lastly, based on the
complemented nearest neighbor set in each view, a graph learning-based
multi-view semi-supervised LDL model is constructed. By considering the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures, different views can
mutually provide the local structural information to complement each other. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at multi-view LDL.
Numerical studies have demonstrated that MVSS-LDL attains explicitly better
classification performance than the existing single-view LDL methods.

*Levy Chaves,Eduardo Valle,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Weight Weaving is a plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across scaling parameter search space using pooling functions, eliminating the need for evaluation data in model merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model merging approaches depend on scaling hyperparameters that require data for tuning, which is impractical. There's a need for principled data-free methods to set these scaling factors.

Method: Weight Weaving pools model weights across lambda values search space using user-defined pooling functions like averaging, random selection, or existing model merging methods. It's modular and orthogonal to existing methods.

Result: The method consistently improves performance of several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9 percentage points in data-free settings across ViT variants in multi-task learning, continual learning, and domain generalization experiments.

Conclusion: Weight Weaving provides an effective data-free solution for model merging that enhances performance while eliminating evaluation data requirements.

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of
specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique
leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.
Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters
$\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.
Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data
(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using
privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in
practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a
plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search
space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random
selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high
modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates
orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data
requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three
experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and
domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of
several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9
percentage points in a data-free setting.

*Mohammad Mansoori,Amira Soliman,Farzaneh Etminani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach to ICD code assignment by treating it as both classification and ranking task, achieving superior performance in identifying high-priority codes compared to state-of-the-art classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods treat ICD code assignment as pure classification, ignoring the essential ordering of codes which is crucial for medical diagnosis and reimbursement purposes.

Method: The paper approaches ICD code assignment from a retrieval system perspective, formulating it as a combined classification and ranking task to consider code order.

Result: The proposed model achieves 47% accuracy in ranking primary diagnosis codes (vs 20% for SOTA), and F1 scores of 0.6065 (micro) and 0.2904 (macro), surpassing previous best model's 0.597 and 0.2660.

Conclusion: The retrieval-based framework demonstrates superior ability to identify and rank high-priority ICD codes, making it a promising approach for automated medical coding that considers code order.

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

### [110] [Distributional Consistency Loss: Beyond Pointwise Data Terms in Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13972)
*George Webber,Andrew J. Reader*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Distributional Consistency (DC) loss as a replacement for conventional data-fidelity loss functions in inverse problems, which prevents overfitting to noise by evaluating statistical consistency at the distribution level rather than pointwise matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-fidelity loss functions like MSE lead to overfitting to measurement noise because they seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements. The authors aim to develop a more statistically grounded approach that avoids this issue.

Method: The proposed DC loss evaluates data-fidelity collectively by testing whether observed measurements are statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current estimate, using model-based probability scores for each measurement.

Result: In image denoising with deep image prior, DC loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher PSNR. In medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances hand-crafted regularization efficacy.

Conclusion: DC loss serves as a statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional fidelity losses for inverse problems, being compatible with modern regularizers and avoiding noise overfitting without requiring priors.

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in
inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.
Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal
(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).
Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or
negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,
often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate
data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are
statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current
estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional
consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise
matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability
scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in
replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with
modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,
and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of
priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the
measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists
of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example
application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC
instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher
PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss
reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy
of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a
statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional
fidelity losses for inverse problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BitNet Distillation (BitDistill) is a lightweight pipeline that fine-tunes full-precision LLMs into 1.58-bit ternary weights for specific tasks, achieving comparable performance with 10x memory savings and 2.65x faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient deployment of large language models on resource-constrained devices by reducing model size and computational requirements while maintaining task-specific performance.

Method: Combines three techniques: SubLN module from BitNet, multi-head attention distillation from MiniLM, and continual pre-training as a warm-up step to mitigate performance gap between full-precision and 1.58-bit models.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to full-precision models across different model sizes, with up to 10x memory savings and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs.

Conclusion: BitDistill provides an effective approach for creating highly efficient 1.58-bit LLMs that maintain strong task-specific performance while significantly reducing computational and memory requirements.

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

*Mike Lasby,Ivan Lazarevich,Nish Sinnadurai,Sean Lie,Yani Ioannou,Vithursan Thangarasa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Expert pruning outperforms expert merging for SMoE model compression on generative tasks, with REAP method achieving near-lossless compression at 50% pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMoE models have large parameter counts creating significant memory overhead, motivating research into expert compression methods.

Method: Proposed Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP) that considers both router gate-values and expert activation norms for pruning experts.

Result: REAP consistently outperforms merging and other pruning methods across SMoE models from 20B to 1T parameters, achieving near-lossless compression on code generation and tool-calling tasks with 50% expert pruning.

Conclusion: Expert pruning is superior to merging for generative tasks due to avoiding functional subspace collapse, and REAP provides an effective pruning criterion for SMoE compression.

Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models offer efficient
pre-training and low latency but their large parameter counts create
significant memory overhead, motivating research into expert compression.
Contrary to recent findings favouring expert merging on discriminative
benchmarks, we demonstrate that expert pruning is a superior strategy for
generative tasks. We prove that merging introduces an irreducible error by
causing a "functional subspace collapse", due to the loss of the router's
independent, input-dependent control over experts. Leveraging this insight, we
propose Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP), a novel pruning
criterion that considers both router gate-values and expert activation norms.
Across a diverse set of SMoE models ranging from 20B to 1T parameters, REAP
consistently outperforms merging and other pruning methods on generative
benchmarks, especially at 50% compression. Notably, our method achieves
near-lossless compression on code generation and tool-calling tasks with
Qwen3-Coder-480B and Kimi-K2, even after pruning 50% of experts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies incompleteness in Clifford-Steerable CNN kernel bases and proposes Conditional Clifford-Steerable Kernels with input-dependent equivariant representations to enhance model expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited expressivity of Clifford-Steerable CNNs due to incomplete kernel bases, which restricts their performance on equivariant learning tasks.

Method: Proposed Conditional Clifford-Steerable Kernels that augment kernels with equivariant representations computed from input feature fields, with efficient solution via implicit parameterization.

Result: Improved expressivity demonstrated on multiple PDE forecasting tasks including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, consistently outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed conditional kernel framework successfully addresses the expressivity limitations of CSCNNs and shows superior performance on complex equivariant learning tasks.

Abstract: Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows
incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including
isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we
demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the
model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional
Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant
representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the
equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can
be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate
an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting
tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our
method consistently outperforms baseline methods.

*Jie Hao,Xiaochuan Gong,Jie Xu,Zhengdao Wang,Mingrui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme for geometry-aware optimization algorithms that accelerates DNN training by adapting learning rates within layer groups based on gradient variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard geometry-aware optimizers use fixed learning rates within layer groups, but local curvature varies across layers and changes dynamically during training, making fixed rates inefficient.

Method: Proposes estimating gradient variance in the dual norm induced by the linear minimization oracle (LMO) to assign time-varying, noise-adaptive layerwise learning rates within each group.

Result: Empirical results on transformer architectures (LLaMA, GPT) show faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers.

Conclusion: The noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme substantially accelerates DNN training compared to methods using fixed learning rates within groups.

Abstract: Geometry-aware optimization algorithms, such as Muon, have achieved
remarkable success in training deep neural networks (DNNs). These methods
leverage the underlying geometry of DNNs by selecting appropriate norms for
different layers and updating parameters via norm-constrained linear
minimization oracles (LMOs). However, even within a group of layers associated
with the same norm, the local curvature can be heterogeneous across layers and
vary dynamically over the course of training. For example, recent work shows
that sharpness varies substantially across transformer layers and throughout
training, yet standard geometry-aware optimizers impose fixed learning rates to
layers within the same group, which may be inefficient for DNN training.
  In this paper, we introduce a noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme
on top of geometry-aware optimization algorithms and substantially accelerate
DNN training compared to methods that use fixed learning rates within each
group. Our method estimates gradient variance in the dual norm induced by the
chosen LMO on the fly, and uses it to assign time-varying noise-adaptive
layerwise learning rates within each group. We provide a theoretical analysis
showing that our algorithm achieves a sharp convergence rate. Empirical results
on transformer architectures such as LLaMA and GPT demonstrate that our
approach achieves faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers.

*Riccardo Zattra,Giacomo Baggio,Umberto Casti,Augusto Ferrante,Francesco Ticozzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COFFEE is a novel time-varying state space model that uses state feedback for context-dependent selectivity, enabling better long-range dependency capture with fewer parameters and training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers suffer from quadratic complexity and poor long-range dependency handling. While state space models like Mamba's S6 offer efficiency, their selectivity only depends on current input, lacking context awareness.

Method: COFFEE incorporates state feedback to compute selectivity from internal states (representing sequence history), uses efficient model parametrization to remove S6 redundancies, and maintains parallel implementation capability.

Result: Achieves near-perfect accuracy on induction head task with 100x fewer parameters and training sequences than S6. On MNIST, reaches 97% accuracy with only 3585 parameters, significantly outperforming S6.

Conclusion: State feedback is a key mechanism for building scalable and efficient sequence models, enabling better context-dependent processing with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Transformers, powered by the attention mechanism, are the backbone of most
foundation models, yet they suffer from quadratic complexity and difficulties
in dealing with long-range dependencies in the input sequence. Recent work has
shown that state space models (SSMs) provide an efficient alternative, with the
S6 module at the core of the Mamba architecture achieving state-of-the-art
results on long-sequence benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the COFFEE
(COntext From FEEdback) model, a novel time-varying SSM that incorporates state
feedback to enable context-dependent selectivity, while still allowing for
parallel implementation. Whereas the selectivity mechanism of S6 only depends
on the current input, COFFEE computes it from the internal state, which serves
as a compact representation of the sequence history. This shift allows the
model to regulate its dynamics based on accumulated context, improving its
ability to capture long-range dependencies. In addition to state feedback, we
employ an efficient model parametrization that removes redundancies present in
S6 and leads to a more compact and trainable formulation. On the induction head
task, COFFEE achieves near-perfect accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer
parameters and training sequences compared to S6. On MNIST, COFFEE largely
outperforms S6 within the same architecture, reaching 97% accuracy with only
3585 parameters. These results showcase the role of state feedback as a key
mechanism for building scalable and efficient sequence models.

TL;DR: A new benchmark for Causal Representation Learning using high-fidelity simulated visual data that bridges the gap between realistic visual complexity and access to ground-truth causal processes across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CRL evaluations face a dilemma between realism and evaluative precision, relying on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on real-world tasks without ground-truth causal information.

Method: Created a comprehensive dataset with 200k images and 3M video frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis. The benchmark provides flexible access to underlying causal structures.

Result: The benchmark enables evaluation of CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offers empirical insights for choosing appropriate CRL frameworks for specific real-world problems.

Conclusion: This new benchmark successfully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and real-world applicability in causal representation learning, providing a comprehensive testbed with both realistic visual complexity and ground-truth causal information.

Abstract: Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims to uncover the data-generating
process and identify the underlying causal variables and relations, whose
evaluation remains inherently challenging due to the requirement of known
ground-truth causal variables and causal structure. Existing evaluations often
rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on
real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative
precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using
high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual
complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating
processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video
frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic
physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis.
These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex
structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive
testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and
real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the
underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to
align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels,
temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we
evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered
empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or
extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real
problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective. Welcome to visit our:

TL;DR: FedHFT is a federated fine-tuning framework that addresses data heterogeneity and resource constraints in LLM fine-tuning using masked adapters and bi-level optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of limited/heterogeneous data due to privacy requirements and varying computational resources across clients in federated learning settings.

Method: Uses mixture of masked adapters for resource heterogeneity and bi-level optimization with masked personalization and client clustering for non-iid data.

Result: Shows significant performance and efficiency improvements over existing heterogeneous federated learning methods on various NLU tasks.

Conclusion: FedHFT effectively handles data and resource heterogeneity in federated fine-tuning of LLMs while maintaining data privacy.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has become a common
practice for personalized natural language understanding (NLU) applications on
downstream tasks and domain-specific datasets. However, there are two main
challenges: (i) limited and/or heterogeneous data for fine-tuning due to
proprietary data confidentiality or privacy requirements, and (ii) varying
computation resources available across participating clients such as edge
devices. This paper presents FedHFT - an efficient and personalized federated
fine-tuning framework to address both challenges. First, we introduce a mixture
of masked adapters to handle resource heterogeneity across participating
clients, enabling high-performance collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained
language model(s) across multiple clients in a distributed setting, while
keeping proprietary data local. Second, we introduce a bi-level optimization
approach to handle non-iid data distribution based on masked personalization
and client clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
performance and efficiency improvements over various natural language
understanding tasks under data and resource heterogeneity compared to
representative heterogeneous federated learning methods.

*Moritz Grillo,Tobias Hofmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse maxout networks with fixed indegree constraints exhibit depth hierarchies where depth is essential for expressivity and width cannot compensate for insufficient depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the expressivity of sparse maxout networks that model convolutional and graph neural networks, and to establish the relationship between network depth and computational power under sparsity constraints.

Method: Established a duality between sparse maxout networks and virtual polytopes, derived tight bounds on polytope dimensions, and constructed depth hierarchies to analyze expressivity.

Result: Proved that sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are universal, but when depth is insufficient, width alone cannot overcome the limitations imposed by fixed indegree sparsity constraints.

Conclusion: Depth is crucial for expressivity in sparse maxout networks, and there exists a fundamental trade-off where width cannot substitute for insufficient depth under fixed indegree constraints.

Abstract: We study the expressivity of sparse maxout networks, where each neuron takes
a fixed number of inputs from the previous layer and employs a, possibly
multi-argument, maxout activation. This setting captures key characteristics of
convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between
functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking
their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a
tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the
central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of
depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are
universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone
cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.

TL;DR: Neural Effect Search is a novel method that discovers unknown causal effects from trial data using foundation models and sparse autoencoders, addressing multiple-testing issues through progressive stratification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RCTs rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis, preventing causal effect estimation at scale and potentially missing important effects. The goal is to discover unknown treatment effects directly from data without predefined hypotheses.

Method: Transform unstructured trial data into meaningful representations using pretrained foundation models, then interpret them via sparse autoencoder. Use Neural Effect Search - a recursive procedure with progressive stratification to address multiple-testing issues and effects entanglement.

Result: The algorithm demonstrated robustness in semi-synthetic experiments and successfully achieved unsupervised causal effect identification in a real-world scientific trial in experimental ecology.

Conclusion: Neural Effect Search enables unsupervised discovery of causal effects from trial data, overcoming limitations of traditional hypothesis-driven approaches and allowing for scalable causal effect estimation.

Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless,
they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints
prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet
incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a
treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial
into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret
them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects
at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects
entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a
novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification.
After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments,
we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful
unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

Motivation: Despite increasing use of neural networks for solving differential equations, there's insufficient theoretical foundation explaining why they work effectively for reaction-diffusion systems.

Method: Theoretical analysis building on universal approximation theorem, examining neural network approximation power for reaction-diffusion equations in 1D and 2D with homogeneous and heterogeneous media.

Result: Demonstrated that 2-layer neural networks can approximate 1D reaction-diffusion equations and 3-layer networks can approximate 2D versions. Framework can be extended to elliptic and parabolic equations.

Conclusion: Neural networks have strong expressive power for approximating solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and related PDEs, providing theoretical foundation for neural network-based differential equation solvers.

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion systems represent one of the most fundamental formulations
used to describe a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological processes.
With the increasing adoption of neural networks, recent research has focused on
solving differential equations using machine learning techniques. However, the
theoretical foundation explaining why neural networks can effectively
approximate such solutions remains insufficiently explored.
  This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the approximation power of
neural networks for one- and two-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations in
both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. Building upon the universal
approximation theorem, we demonstrate that a two-layer neural network can
approximate the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation, while a
three-layer neural network can approximate its two-dimensional counterpart. The
theoretical framework presented here can be further extended to elliptic and
parabolic equations.
  Overall, this work highlights the expressive power of neural networks in
approximating solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and related PDEs,

Motivation: Systematic compositional generalization beyond training distribution remains a core challenge for language models and machine learning systems, particularly for emergent reasoning abilities.

Method: Uses GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs as testbed, introducing four architectural mechanisms: input-adaptive recurrence, algorithmic supervision, anchored latent representations via discrete bottleneck, and explicit error-correction mechanism.

Result: The proposed mechanisms collectively enable native and scalable latent space reasoning in Transformers with robust algorithmic generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The architectural approach enhances out-of-distribution generalization, with mechanistic interpretability analysis revealing how these mechanisms produce robust generalization abilities.

Abstract: Systematic, compositional generalization beyond the training distribution
remains a core challenge in machine learning -- and a critical bottleneck for
the emergent reasoning abilities of modern language models. This work
investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Transformer networks
using a GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs task as a
testbed. We introduce and explore a set of four architectural mechanisms aimed
at enhancing OOD generalization: (i) input-adaptive recurrence; (ii)
algorithmic supervision; (iii) anchored latent representations via a discrete
bottleneck; and (iv) an explicit error-correction mechanism. Collectively,
these mechanisms yield an architectural approach for native and scalable latent
space reasoning in Transformer networks with robust algorithmic generalization

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transfer entropy estimation methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence.

Method: TENDE leverages score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional mutual information by learning score functions of the relevant conditional distributions.

Result: TENDE demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks and real data.

Abstract: Transfer entropy measures directed information flow in time series, and it
has become a fundamental quantity in applications spanning neuroscience,
finance, and complex systems analysis. However, existing estimation methods
suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional

address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer

score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional
mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional
distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making
minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an online learning-based pricing and matching policy for two-sided markets with unknown demand/supply curves, achieving near-optimal tradeoff between regret, average queue length, and maximum queue length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Design pricing and matching algorithms for two-sided markets that maximize platform profit while maintaining reasonable queue lengths, especially when demand and supply curves are unknown in practice.

Method: A novel online-learning-based pricing policy with two key features: dynamic component optimizing tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths, and probabilistic component resolving tension between learning and queue management.

Result: Proved tradeoff among three metrics: O(T^{1-γ}) regret, O(T^{γ/2}) average queue length, and O(T^{γ}) maximum queue length for γ ∈ (0, 1/6], significantly improving over existing results. Showed this tradeoff is optimal up to logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: The proposed policy achieves near-optimal performance in balancing profit maximization and queue management for two-sided markets with unknown demand/supply curves, matching the optimal performance of policies that assume known curves.

Abstract: We study a two-sided market, wherein, price-sensitive heterogeneous customers
and servers arrive and join their respective queues. A compatible
customer-server pair can then be matched by the platform, at which point, they
leave the system. Our objective is to design pricing and matching algorithms
that maximize the platform's profit, while maintaining reasonable queue
lengths. As the demand and supply curves governing the price-dependent arrival
rates may not be known in practice, we design a novel online-learning-based
pricing policy and establish its near-optimality. In particular, we prove a
tradeoff among three performance metrics: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret,
$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$ average queue length, and $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$
maximum queue length for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6]$, significantly improving over
existing results [1]. Moreover, barring the permissible range of $\gamma$, we
show that this trade-off between regret and average queue length is optimal up
to logarithmic factors under a class of policies, matching the optimal one as
in [2] which assumes the demand and supply curves to be known. Our proposed
policy has two noteworthy features: a dynamic component that optimizes the
tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths; and a probabilistic
component that resolves the tension between obtaining useful samples for fast
learning and maintaining small queue lengths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have shown great potential for solving Bayesian inverse problems by serving as priors, offering a powerful approach to sample from complex posterior distributions.

Method: The methods primarily employ a twisting mechanism for intermediate distributions in the diffusion process, guiding simulations toward the posterior distribution, combined with various Monte Carlo sampling techniques.

Result: The review demonstrates how pre-trained diffusion models can be effectively leveraged for Bayesian inference through this twisting approach.

Conclusion: Diffusion models combined with Monte Carlo methods provide a promising framework for solving Bayesian inverse problems using existing pre-trained models without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Diffusion models enable the synthesis of highly accurate samples from complex

they have demonstrated significant potential for solving Bayesian inverse
problems by serving as priors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of
current methods that leverage \emph{pre-trained} diffusion models alongside
Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems without requiring
additional training. We show that these methods primarily employ a
\emph{twisting} mechanism for the intermediate distributions within the
diffusion process, guiding the simulations toward the posterior distribution.
We describe how various Monte Carlo methods are then used to aid in sampling
from these twisted distributions.

TL;DR: SGCRL is a self-supervised RL algorithm that solves long-horizon tasks without external rewards. It uses learned representations to shape implicit rewards that automatically balance exploration and exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind emergent exploration in unsupervised reinforcement learning, specifically how self-supervised algorithms can solve challenging tasks without external guidance.

Method: Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL) - combining theoretical analysis of the objective function with controlled experiments to study exploration dynamics driven by learned representations.

Result: SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by its learned representations, which automatically modify the reward landscape to promote exploration before goal achievement and exploitation after. Exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank state representations rather than neural network function approximation.

Conclusion: The improved understanding of SGCRL's exploration mechanisms enables adaptation for safety-aware exploration, demonstrating practical applications of the theoretical insights.

Abstract: In this work, we take a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms behind
emergent exploration in unsupervised reinforcement learning. We study
Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL), a self-supervised
algorithm capable of solving challenging long-horizon goal-reaching tasks
without external rewards or curricula. We combine theoretical analysis of the
algorithm's objective function with controlled experiments to understand what
drives its exploration. We show that SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by
its learned representations. These representations automatically modify the
reward landscape to promote exploration before reaching the goal and
exploitation thereafter. Our experiments also demonstrate that these
exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank representations of the state
space rather than from neural network function approximation. Our improved
understanding enables us to adapt SGCRL to perform safety-aware exploration.

### [127] [Learning Wireless Interference Patterns: Decoupled GNN for Throughput Prediction in Heterogeneous Multi-Hop p-CSMA Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14137)
*Faezeh Dehghan Tarzjani,Bhaskar Krishnamachari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes D-GCN, a novel graph neural network architecture that decouples node transmission probability from neighbor interference effects to accurately predict saturation throughput in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks, overcoming limitations of traditional analytical methods and standard GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional p-persistent CSMA protocol analysis faces challenges: simplified models underestimate throughput by 48-62% in sparse topologies, while exact Markov-chain analyses are accurate but computationally infeasible for large networks. Standard GNNs like GCN perform poorly (63.94% NMAE) due to interference propagation issues.

Method: Proposed Decoupled Graph Convolutional Network (D-GCN) that explicitly separates processing of node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. Replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention to capture complex multihop interference patterns and provide interpretable per-neighbor contribution weights.

Result: D-GCN achieves 3.3% normalized mean absolute error (NMAE), significantly outperforming standard GCN (63.94% NMAE) and other baselines. The method remains computationally tractable even when exact analytical methods become infeasible, and enables gradient-based network optimization achieving within 1% of theoretical optima.

Conclusion: D-GCN provides an effective machine learning solution for scalable throughput prediction in general network topologies, addressing fundamental limitations of both traditional analytical methods and standard GNN architectures through explicit decoupling of interference effects.

Abstract: The p-persistent CSMA protocol is central to random-access MAC analysis, but
predicting saturation throughput in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks
remains a hard problem. Simplified models that assume a single, shared
interference domain can underestimate throughput by 48--62\% in sparse
topologies. Exact Markov-chain analyses are accurate but scale exponentially in
computation time, making them impractical for large networks. These
computational barriers motivate structural machine learning approaches like
GNNs for scalable throughput prediction in general network topologies. Yet
off-the-shelf GNNs struggle here: a standard GCN yields 63.94\% normalized mean
absolute error (NMAE) on heterogeneous networks because symmetric normalization
conflates a node's direct interference with higher-order, cascading effects
that pertain to how interference propagates over the network graph.
  Building on these insights, we propose the Decoupled Graph Convolutional
Network (D-GCN), a novel architecture that explicitly separates processing of a
node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. D-GCN
replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention, yielding interpretable,
per-neighbor contribution weights while capturing complex multihop interference
patterns. D-GCN attains 3.3\% NMAE, outperforms strong baselines, remains
tractable even when exact analytical methods become computationally infeasible,
and enables gradient-based network optimization that achieves within 1\% of
theoretical optima.

*Islam Akef Ebeid,Haoteng Tang,Pengfei Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProtGram-DirectGCN, a two-stage graph learning framework for protein-protein interaction prediction that uses n-gram graphs from protein sequences and a custom directed graph neural network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop less computationally intensive alternatives to existing methods that use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language Models or Graph Neural Networks for 3D protein structures.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) ProtGram models protein primary structure as hierarchy of n-gram graphs with residue transition probabilities as edge weights; (2) DirectGCN processes directed graphs with path-specific transformations and learnable gating mechanism to generate protein embeddings.

Result: DirectGCN matches established methods on standard benchmarks and excels at complex directed graphs. The full framework delivers robust PPI prediction performance even with limited training data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an effective and computationally efficient alternative for protein-protein interaction prediction through graph representation learning.

Abstract: Introduction Accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
crucial for understanding cellular functions and advancing drug development.
Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language
Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein
structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We
introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link
prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning
framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach
models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram
graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights.
Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities
are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN,
a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a
unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate
path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared
transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating
mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level
embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level
embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of
DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches
established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed
graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the
full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong
performance holds even with limited training data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of ranking loss functions for Transformer models in stock return forecasting, comparing pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches for portfolio selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard loss functions focus on prediction accuracy but don't directly teach models to learn correct stock return orderings, which is crucial for quantitative trading strategies. There's limited understanding of how different ranking loss functions perform with Transformers in financial markets.

Method: Comprehensive benchmark evaluating diverse loss functions (pointwise, pairwise, listwise) for daily stock return forecasting using Transformer models on S&P 500 data, focusing on cross-sectional and temporal pattern learning.

Result: The research provides a systematic comparison revealing how different loss functions impact model ability to learn relative orderings among assets for portfolio selection.

Conclusion: Offers practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based trading strategies by understanding the effects of different loss functions on Transformer models' stock ranking performance.

Abstract: Quantitative trading strategies rely on accurately ranking stocks to identify
profitable investments. Effective portfolio management requires models that can
reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for
understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions
affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial
markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships
between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction
accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the
correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from
fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison
to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used
with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this
gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions
including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to
facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data. We focus on
assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern
profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a
comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's
ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio
selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based
trading strategies.

### [131] [Towards Reversible Model Merging For Low-rank Weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14163)
*Mohammadsajad Alipour,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Reversible Model Merging (RMM) - a new approach that constructs a compact basis to recover original task-specific models via linear combination, instead of collapsing all adapters into one merged model, addressing performance degradation in low-rank compressed models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional merging methods applied to low-rank weights (LoRA or SVD) lead to severe performance degradation in merged models, and no merged model can consistently outperform specialized models for their specific tasks.

Method: RMM constructs a compact basis from which original task-specific models can be recovered via linear combination. It provides a closed-form solution for selecting optimal basis weights and task-specific coefficients, reframing merging as generating a reconstruction-capable model space.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model scales show RMM consistently outperforms existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed models by a significant margin.

Conclusion: RMM offers an efficient, data-free, and flexible alternative to conventional merging by enabling reversible reconstruction of specialized models from a compact basis, rather than producing a single compromised merged model.

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

*Guan-Horng Liu,Tianrong Chen,Evangelos A. Theodorou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper connects deep neural network optimization with optimal control theory, proposing OCNOpt - a new optimizer based on dynamic programming principles that improves robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the algorithmic resemblance between Backpropagation in DNNs and optimality conditions in dynamical systems, leveraging optimal control theory for principled neural network optimization.

Method: Developed OCNOpt by solving approximate dynamic programming with first-order expansion of Bellman equation, enabling layer-wise feedback policies and higher-order training of continuous-time models.

Result: OCNOpt demonstrates improved robustness and efficiency over existing methods while maintaining manageable computational complexity in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The work establishes a principled algorithmic design framework grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory, opening new avenues for neural network optimization.

Abstract: Optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a driving force in the
advancement of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. With DNNs
characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining
their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework
of Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical
systems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled
analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical
pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated
observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation
algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for
dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic
programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a
variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the
first-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring
higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer,
termed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich
algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies,
game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time
models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt
improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining
manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled
algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address critical annotation backlogs in financial services where millions of customer utterances require accurate categorization, bridging the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems and practical enterprise deployment.

Method: Combines specialized agents with structured reasoning and judge-based consensus mechanism, supporting dynamic task adaptation through configuration rather than code changes for custom annotation types.

Result: Eliminated 1 million utterance backlog with 86% human agreement, 85% high confidence classifications, 13.8% higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1 scores over baselines.

Conclusion: Provides a blueprint for organizations facing annotation challenges, demonstrating consistent improvements across multiple datasets and languages while enabling human annotators to focus on ambiguous cases.

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent
improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%
higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1
in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public
benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems
and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations
facing similar annotation challenges.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConDA applies contrastive learning to diffusion model embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics, enabling interpretable control through nonlinear trajectory traversal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have powerful generation capabilities but their latent spaces lack explicit organization for interpretable control, limiting their utility for controllable generation tasks.

Method: ConDA framework uses contrastive learning within diffusion embeddings to structure latent spaces so that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors, enabling nonlinear trajectory traversal.

Result: Across fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging, neurostimulation, and facial expression benchmarks, ConDA produces interpretable latent representations with improved controllability over linear traversals and conditioning-based methods.

Conclusion: Diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this structure requires proper latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold, which ConDA provides through contrastive learning.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not
explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive
Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within
diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated
by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more
disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents
such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within
this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory
traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable
generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging,
therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces
interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to
linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that
diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this
structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy, but faces practical limitations due to the participation dilemma where entities may not contribute without receiving benefits.

Method: Examines economic and game theory concepts applied to federated learning, along with technology-driven solutions like blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. Presents a comprehensive taxonomy covering both centralized and decentralized architectures.

Result: Identifies fundamental challenges in designing incentive mechanisms and demonstrates that well-designed incentives are essential for practical success of federated learning systems.

Conclusion: Well-designed incentive mechanisms are essential components for practical success of federated learning, with promising solutions emerging but significant challenges remaining in building sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.

Abstract: Federated learning promises to revolutionize machine learning by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. However,
practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the
participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute
to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to
participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental
challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It
examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be
applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as
blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive
taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized
architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore,
the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering
emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure,
vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this
exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms
are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical
success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising
solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in
building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.

*Asma Jamali,Tin Sum Cheng,Rodrigo A. Vargas-Hernández*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comprehensive spectral analysis of molecular kernels reveals that richer spectral features don't consistently improve accuracy, challenging the common heuristic that richer spectra yield better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between kernel spectral properties and generalization performance in molecular property prediction, as systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are scarce despite extensive kernel studies in ML.

Method: Analyzed kernel ridge regression on QM9 dataset using molecular fingerprints, pretrained transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular properties, employing four spectral metrics and Pearson correlation tests, and implemented truncated kernels to probe spectrum-performance relationship.

Result: Surprisingly, richer spectral features don't consistently improve accuracy; for transformer-based and local 3D representations, spectral richness can negatively correlate with performance. Truncated kernels show retaining only top 2% of eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the common heuristic that richer spectra yield better generalization and highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and predictive performance, informing evaluation of kernel and self-supervised learning methods in data-limited scientific tasks.

Abstract: Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled
perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel
methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and
transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra
in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are
scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of
kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained
transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular
properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different
spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation
tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations,
spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We
also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and
predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of
eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading
eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the
common heuristic that "richer spectra yield better generalization" and
highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and
predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings
inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in
data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.

*Nils Philipp Walter,Linara Adilova,Jilles Vreeken,Michael Kamp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flat minima in neural networks provide local adversarial robustness but not global robustness, as adversarial examples can exist in large flat regions where models are confidently wrong.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formally analyze the relationship between flat minima and adversarial robustness, challenging the informal intuition that flatness always implies robustness.

Method: Derived closed-form expression for relative flatness in penultimate layer, used this to constrain loss variation in input space, and formally analyzed network adversarial robustness.

Result: Flatness implies local robustness but not global robustness; maintaining robustness beyond local neighborhood requires sharp curvature away from data manifold.

Conclusion: Simplified views of flatness are insufficient - flat minima provide local robustness but adversarial examples exist in flat regions where models are confidently wrong, requiring nuanced understanding.

Abstract: Despite their empirical success, neural networks remain vulnerable to small,
adversarial perturbations. A longstanding hypothesis suggests that flat minima,
regions of low curvature in the loss landscape, offer increased robustness.
While intuitive, this connection has remained largely informal and incomplete.
By rigorously formalizing the relationship, we show this intuition is only
partially correct: flatness implies local but not global adversarial
robustness. To arrive at this result, we first derive a closed-form expression
for relative flatness in the penultimate layer, and then show we can use this
to constrain the variation of the loss in input space. This allows us to
formally analyze the adversarial robustness of the entire network. We then show
that to maintain robustness beyond a local neighborhood, the loss needs to
curve sharply away from the data manifold. We validate our theoretical
predictions empirically across architectures and datasets, uncovering the
geometric structure that governs adversarial vulnerability, and linking
flatness to model confidence: adversarial examples often lie in large, flat
regions where the model is confidently wrong. Our results challenge simplified
views of flatness and provide a nuanced understanding of its role in
robustness.

Motivation: Competitive programming like IOI is a key benchmark for evaluating LLMs, but achieving gold medal performance with open-weight models remains challenging while proprietary models often have undisclosed methods.

Method: Combines large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and round-robin submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under limited validation budgets.

Result: GenCluster achieves gold medal performance at IOI 2025 using gpt-oss-120b open-weight model, scaling consistently with available compute and narrowing the gap between open and closed systems.

Conclusion: Sets a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible evaluation of reasoning in LLMs by demonstrating IOI gold-level performance with open-weight models for the first time.

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of decision-making under distribution shift in RL, where training and deployment environments differ, and bridge the gap in policy optimization methods for robust RL which remain theoretically and empirically underexplored.

Method: Propose DR-RPO algorithm that incorporates reference-policy regularization within softmax policy class, uses d-rectangular linear MDP formulation with linear function approximation, and employs upper confidence bonus for optimistic exploration.

Result: Achieves polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency matching value-based approaches, with empirical results demonstrating robustness across diverse domains.

Conclusion: Policy optimization can be effectively applied to robust RL with theoretical guarantees and practical performance, providing a viable alternative to value-based methods for distributionally robust reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ.
We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes
(RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics.
Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction
with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially
critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains
theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap,
we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized
\textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online
policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret.
To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO
incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are
doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large
state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and
combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for
optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy
optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency
in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally,
empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate
the robustness of DR-RPO.

*Lianzi Jiang,Jianxin Zhang,Xinyu Han,Huanhe Dong,Xiangrong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PhysAttnNet is a physics-guided dual-stream attention network that improves motion response prediction for elastic Bragg breakwaters by incorporating temporal decay and wave-structure interaction modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional deep learning models have limited generalization for unseen sea states due to neglect of natural decay in marine systems and inadequate modeling of wave-structure interaction.

Method: Proposes PhysAttnNet with: 1) DBSA module with learnable temporal decay, 2) PDG-BCA module with cosine-based bias for wave-structure interaction, 3) GCF module for stream integration, and 4) hybrid time-frequency loss function.

Result: PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms mainstream models in wave flume experiments and demonstrates robust cross-scenario generalization to unseen environments.

Conclusion: The framework shows potential for developing predictive models for complex systems in ocean engineering, with validated robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: Accurate motion response prediction for elastic Bragg breakwaters is critical
for their structural safety and operational integrity in marine environments.
However, conventional deep learning models often exhibit limited generalization
capabilities when presented with unseen sea states. These deficiencies stem
from the neglect of natural decay observed in marine systems and inadequate
modeling of wave-structure interaction (WSI). To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network
(PhysAttnNet). First, the decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) module
incorporates a learnable temporal decay to assign higher weights to recent
states, aiming to emulate the natural decay phenomenon. Meanwhile, the phase
differences guided bidirectional cross-attention (PDG-BCA) module explicitly
captures the bidirectional interaction and phase relationship between waves and
the structure using a cosine-based bias within a bidirectional
cross-computation paradigm. These streams are synergistically integrated
through a global context fusion (GCF) module. Finally, PhysAttnNet is trained
with a hybrid time-frequency loss that jointly minimizes time-domain prediction
errors and frequency-domain spectral discrepancies. Comprehensive experiments
on wave flume datasets demonstrate that PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms
mainstream models. Furthermore,cross-scenario generalization tests validate the
model's robustness and adaptability to unseen environments, highlighting its
potential as a framework to develop predictive models for complex systems in
ocean engineering.

Brown,Amit Shah,Craig Jabaley,Tim Buchman,Sivasubramanium V Bhavani,Randall J. Lee,Xiao Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks generalist vs specialist foundation models for PPG signal analysis, finding specialist models perform 27% better in full-tuning scenarios across 51 cardiac assessment tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are increasingly used in time-series analysis, but most are specialist models trained on specific data types. Recent generalist models like MOMENT use multi-domain data, but their performance compared to specialists for physiological signals like PPG remains unclear.

Method: Comprehensive benchmarking study comparing generalist and specialist models on 51 PPG tasks across 7 dimensions: win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability.

Result: Specialist models achieved 27% higher win score than generalist models in full-tuning scenarios. The study also analyzed generalization, fairness, attention patterns, and training data importance.

Conclusion: Specialist foundation models outperform generalist models for PPG signal analysis tasks, particularly in full-tuning scenarios, highlighting the importance of domain-specific pre-training for physiological sensing applications.

Abstract: Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are
pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various
downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural
Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and
CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis,
particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation
models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the
same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and
Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time
series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather,
traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive
benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist
models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51
tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and
cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven
dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning
gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics
jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability,
robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a
holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse
downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the
specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further
analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the
importance of training data choice.

*Zihao Fu,Ming Liao,Chris Russell,Zhenguang G. Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAST is a probe-free framework for analyzing transformer layer functions through direct transformation matrix estimation and spectral analysis, revealing distinct behaviors between encoder-only and decoder-only models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models remain black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms, despite various existing interpretability methods providing valuable but limited insights.

Method: CAST uses Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse to estimate realized transformation matrices for each layer and applies spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics to characterize layer behavior.

Result: Analysis reveals decoder models exhibit compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank processing. CKA similarity matrices partition layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

Conclusion: CAST provides complementary insights to existing interpretability methods by offering a novel perspective on transformer layer functions through direct transformation matrix analysis and spectral tracking.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

### [143] [Nonparametric Data Attribution for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14269)
*Yutian Zhao,Chao Du,Xiaosen Zheng,Tianyu Pang,Min Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a nonparametric data attribution method for diffusion models that measures influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images, without requiring model gradients or retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attribution methods for diffusion models typically need model gradients or retraining, which limits their use in proprietary or large-scale settings where such access is restricted.

Method: A nonparametric approach that operates entirely on data, measuring influence through patch-level similarity between generated and training images, grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and extended to multiscale representations with convolution-based acceleration.

Result: The method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines, while producing spatially interpretable attributions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an effective nonparametric alternative for data attribution in diffusion models that works without model access and uncovers intrinsic relationships between training data and outputs.

Abstract: Data attribution for generative models seeks to quantify the influence of
individual training examples on model outputs. Existing methods for diffusion
models typically require access to model gradients or retraining, limiting
their applicability in proprietary or large-scale settings. We propose a
nonparametric attribution method that operates entirely on data, measuring
influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images. Our
approach is grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and
naturally extends to multiscale representations, while remaining
computationally efficient through convolution-based acceleration. In addition
to producing spatially interpretable attributions, our framework uncovers
patterns that reflect intrinsic relationships between training data and
outputs, independent of any specific model. Experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based
approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines.

### [144] [Stable Prediction of Adverse Events in Medical Time-Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14286)
*Mayank Keoliya,Seewon Choi,Rajeev Alur,Mayur Naik,Eric Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAREBench is a new benchmark for early event prediction that evaluates both accuracy and temporal stability of risk trajectories using multi-modal inputs (EHR, ECG, clinical text), revealing that current methods struggle to balance these requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEP benchmarks ignore temporal stability of risk scores and focus mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior untested for clinical deployment.

Method: Introduces CAREBench benchmark with multi-modal inputs and a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability using local-Lipschitz constants. Evaluates classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs across six prediction tasks.

Result: Existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points.

Conclusion: Models need to produce evidence-aligned, stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

Abstract: Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's
imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk
trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new,
relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk
scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior
untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that
evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms,
and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive
accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability
in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz
constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and
compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across
tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy
and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points.
These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned,
stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

### [145] [Enhancing Time-Series Anomaly Detection by Integrating Spectral-Residual Bottom-Up Attention with Reservoir Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14287)
*Hayato Nihei,Sou Nobukawa,Yusuke Sakemi,Kazuyuki Aihara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SR-RC, which combines spectral residual (SR) method with reservoir computing to improve time-series anomaly detection performance without sacrificing learning efficiency, making it suitable for Edge AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reservoir computing is attractive for Edge AI due to its simplicity (only output layer training), but achieving good anomaly detection performance may require large reservoirs that are impractical on resource-constrained edge devices. Attention mechanisms can help but may undermine RC's learning efficiency.

Method: Proposed SR-RC integrates the spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism - with reservoir computing. The SR method provides attention without additional training, maintaining RC's efficiency.

Result: SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and logistic-regression models using SR-extracted values across benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets.

Conclusion: SR-RC provides a practical direction for deploying reservoir computing as Edge AI for time-series anomaly detection, as both SR and RC are well-suited for hardware implementation.

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of
time-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of
a recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only
the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in
Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series
anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can
lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection
performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on
resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention
mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial
computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to
improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning
efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the
spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism
- with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and
logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across
benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR
method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC
suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series
anomaly detection.

### [146] [TED++: Submanifold-Aware Backdoor Detection via Layerwise Tubular-Neighbourhood Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14299)
*Nam Le,Leo Yu Zhang,Kewen Liao,Shirui Pan,Wei Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TED++ is a submanifold-aware framework that detects subtle backdoor attacks by constructing tubular neighborhoods around class manifolds and using Locally Adaptive Ranking to identify activations that drift outside acceptable bounds, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance even with limited clean data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stealthy backdoor attacks pose severe security risks for deep neural networks, and existing defenses are vulnerable to subtle distance-based anomalies and perform poorly when clean examples are scarce.

Method: TED++ constructs tubular neighborhoods around each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimates local thickness from clean activations, applies Locally Adaptive Ranking (LAR) to detect activations drifting outside the tube, and aggregates LAR-adjusted ranks across layers to capture input behavior on evolving class submanifolds.

Result: Extensive experiments show TED++ achieves state-of-the-art detection performance under adaptive-attack and limited-data scenarios, delivering near-perfect detection with only five held-out examples per class and achieving up to 14% gains in AUROC over the next-best method.

Conclusion: TED++ effectively detects subtle backdoors that evade existing defenses by leveraging submanifold-aware analysis and tube-constrained behavior characterization, providing robust protection even with minimal clean data.

Abstract: As deep neural networks power increasingly critical applications, stealthy
backdoor attacks, where poisoned training inputs trigger malicious model
behaviour while appearing benign, pose a severe security risk. Many existing
defences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies
or when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++,
a submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that
evade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood
around each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness''
from a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking
(LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By
aggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how
faithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such
characteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose
LAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are
conducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves
state-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and
limited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per
class, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to
14\% in AUROC over the next-best method. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/namle-w/TEDpp.

### [147] [Active Measuring in Reinforcement Learning With Delayed Negative Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14315)
*Daiqi Gao,Ziping Xu,Aseel Rawashdeh,Predrag Klasnja,Susan A. Murphy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Actively Observable MDPs (AOMDPs) where agents can choose to measure latent states at a cost, proposes a belief-based RL algorithm with sequential Monte Carlo approximation, and demonstrates improved sample efficiency despite measurement costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world RL applications, measuring states can be costly and negatively impact future outcomes, creating a trade-off between information gathering and environmental costs.

Method: Formulate AOMDP as periodic partially observable MDP, develop online RL algorithm using belief states, and approximate belief states with sequential Monte Carlo method for posterior estimation of parameters and latent states.

Result: The approach shows provable improvement in sample efficiency and optimal policy value despite measurement costs, validated in a digital health application for intervention delivery and health assessment.

Conclusion: AOMDP framework effectively balances measurement costs with information benefits, enabling more efficient RL in real-world applications where state observation has delayed negative effects.

Abstract: Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world
settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the
Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only
selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state.
The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative
delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may
provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy
despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable
MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate
the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to
jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and
unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital
health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital
interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.

*Shivam Singhal,Eran Malach,Tomaso Poggio,Tomer Galanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-ERM is a propose-and-verify framework that uses LLM-guided search over candidate programs with ERM-style selection, achieving sample-efficient learning of short programs where gradient-based methods fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between sample-efficient but computationally expensive program enumeration and computationally feasible but sample-inefficient gradient-based training for program learning.

Method: Draw k candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis without feedback, adaptivity, or gradients.

Result: LLM-ERM solves tasks like parity variants, pattern matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples.

Conclusion: Language-guided program synthesis recovers statistical efficiency of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond gradient-based training.

Abstract: We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and
computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short
program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a
``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via
length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description
length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require
exponentially many samples on certain short-program families.
  To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework
that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate
programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we
draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and
check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no
feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise
online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs.
{\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern
matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained
transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that
language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency
of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a
practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of
gradient-based training.

*Shruti Sarika Chakraborty,Peter Minary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARTS-GT redesigns Graph Transformers with asymmetric attention and differentiable architecture search to enable depth-specific GNN selection, achieving state-of-the-art performance while providing quantifiable interpretability through causal ablation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Graph Transformers have rigid designs with fixed GNN types across layers and lack quantifiable interpretability, making it hard to distinguish meaningful patterns from spurious correlations.

Method: Redesign GT attention asymmetrically (queries from node features, keys/values from GNN transformations) and use Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at each layer, creating depth-wise heterogeneous architectures.

Result: DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on 4 out of 8 benchmarks while remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing dataset-specific patterns and consistently producing more interpretable models than baselines.

Conclusion: Graph Transformers need not choose between performance and interpretability - heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT achieve both state-of-the-art performance and quantifiable interpretability through causal analysis.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack
quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN
types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component
selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance
gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious
correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural
encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while
keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use
Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at
each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention
itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first
quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our
metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and
nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across
eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while
remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing
dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual
attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating
widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter.
Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced
more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers
need not choose between performance and interpretability.

*Jaewan Park,Solbee Cho,Jay-Yoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stop-RAG is a value-based controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving in iterative RAG systems, improving efficiency and accuracy over fixed-iteration and confidence-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Iterative RAG systems face increasing latency, costs, and risk of distracting evidence with each additional retrieval loop, but existing stopping strategies are either predetermined or use poor confidence proxies.

Method: Cast iterative RAG as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and train Stop-RAG with full-width forward-view Q(λ) targets from complete trajectories, making it compatible with black-box APIs and existing pipelines.

Result: On multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines and prompting-based stopping with LLMs.

Conclusion: Adaptive stopping is a key missing component in current agentic systems, and value-based control can significantly improve RAG system accuracy.

Abstract: Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models
to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases
latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating
the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a
predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly
reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a
finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based
controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with
full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories,
Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with
black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering
benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines
and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive
stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate
that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a geometric interpretation of automatic differentiation theory through differential geometry, offering a foundation for developing structure-preserving differentiation methods in deep learning and scientific computing.

Method: Using jet bundles and Weil algebras to formulate automatic differentiation, with reverse-mode AD as cotangent-pullback and Taylor-mode as evaluation in Weil algebras. Tensorized Weil algebras enable one-pass computation of all mixed derivatives.

Result: Derived concise statements on correctness, stability, and complexity: functorial identity for reverse-mode, algebraic exactness of higher-order derivatives, explicit bounds on truncation error, and linear-cost computation of mixed derivatives avoiding combinatorial blow-up.

Conclusion: The framework successfully interprets AD theory through differential geometry and provides a foundation for developing structure-preserving differentiation methods, with practical implementation available through provided code repository.

Abstract: We present a geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) using
jet bundles and Weil algebras. Reverse-mode AD emerges as cotangent-pullback,
while Taylor-mode corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. From these
principles, we derive concise statements on correctness, stability, and
complexity: a functorial identity for reverse-mode, algebraic exactness of
higher-order derivatives, and explicit bounds on truncation error. We further
show that tensorized Weil algebras permit one-pass computation of all mixed
derivatives with cost linear in the algebra dimension, avoiding the
combinatorial blow-up of nested JVP/VJP schedules. This framework interprets AD
theory through the lens of differential geometry and offers a foundation for
developing structure-preserving differentiation methods in deep learning and
scientific computing. Code and examples are available at

*Andrew Zhao,Reshmi Ghosh,Vitor Carvalho,Emily Lawton,Keegan Hines,Gao Huang,Jack W. Stokes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization, showing that systems are more vulnerable to manipulated feedback than injected queries, with attacks raising success rates by up to 48%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM systems now power everyday AI applications where performance depends on carefully designed prompts, but the security of the prompt optimization stage remains underexamined despite its critical role.

Method: Using HarmBench, the researchers analyzed poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization, introducing a simple fake-reward attack that requires no access to the reward model, and proposing a lightweight highlighting defense.

Result: Feedback-based attacks significantly increase vulnerability, raising attack success rate by up to ΔASR = 0.48. The fake-reward attack increased vulnerability, while the highlighting defense reduced the fake-reward ΔASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility.

Conclusion: Prompt optimization pipelines represent a first-class attack surface that requires stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization frameworks to ensure security.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

*Kartikay Agrawal,Abhijeet Vikram,Vedant Sharma,Vaishnavi N.,Ayon Borthakur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHaRe-SSM is a second-order spiking state space model that combines energy-efficient spiking neural networks with state space models for long-range sequence modeling, achieving better performance than transformers or first-order SSMs while being 73x more energy efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an energy-efficient alternative to transformers for long sequence modeling by combining the benefits of spiking neural networks (energy efficiency, multiplication-free operations) with state space models (linear complexity for long sequences).

Method: Proposed SHaRe-SSM using second-order spiking state space models with resonate and fire neurons, implemented with parallel scans for stable learning over long sequences. Also introduced a kernel-based spiking regressor for very long-range sequences.

Result: SHaRe-SSM outperforms transformers and first-order SSMs on average, consumes 73x less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for 18k sequences, and maintains performance on sequences up to 50k while being significantly energy-efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed SHaRe-SSM provides an energy-efficient and high-performance solution for long-range sequence modeling tasks, successfully combining spiking neural networks with state space models while enabling systematic analysis of resonate-and-fire SSM properties.

Abstract: In recent years, with the emergence of large models, there has been a
significant interest in spiking neural networks (SNNs) primarily due to their
energy efficiency, multiplication-free, and sparse event-based deep learning.
Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a
powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences,
thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a
transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking
Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling
(including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences.
Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or
first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal
for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$
less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while
retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we
propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical
system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a
kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very
long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k
sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted
a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and
conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.

### [154] [Revisit Modality Imbalance at the Decision Layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14411)
*Xiaoyu Ma,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals that modality imbalance in multimodal learning persists at the decision layer, not just during representation learning, with systematic bias toward certain modalities like audio even after balanced optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address modality imbalance where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization in multimodal learning, which affects model performance.

Method: Experiments on audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) to analyze decision-layer bias, and investigation of feature-space and decision-weight distribution disparities.

Result: Models exhibit systematic bias toward certain modalities (e.g., audio) even after extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, due to intrinsic disparities in feature-space and decision-weight distributions.

Conclusion: Future multimodal systems should incorporate adaptive weight allocation mechanisms at the decision layer to enable balanced contributions according to each modality's capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal learning integrates information from different modalities to
enhance model performance, yet it often suffers from modality imbalance, where
dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization. This
paper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation
learning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on
audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after
extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit
systematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis
demonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in
feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization
dynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the
fusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker
modalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that
future multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight
allocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced
according to the capabilities of each modality.

*Tapio Pahikkala,Riikka Numminen,Parisa Movahedi,Napsu Karmitsa,Antti Airola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces IC-index, a new performance metric for evaluating drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction methods by measuring their ability to capture interaction effects between drugs and targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DTA prediction methods focus on predicting affinity values but don't adequately evaluate whether they capture interaction effects, which are crucial for optimal drug-target assignment decisions.

Method: Proposed interaction concordance index (IC-index) to measure prediction of interaction directions. Analyzed invariance properties and showed that permutation equivariance in learning algorithms prevents interaction capture for unseen entities without side information.

Result: IC-index complements existing DTA prediction metrics. Experiments on biomedical datasets with state-of-the-art methods show varying performance in capturing interactions.

Conclusion: IC-index provides valuable additional evaluation of DTA prediction methods by assessing interaction effect direction prediction, which is important for practical decision-making in drug allocation.

Abstract: Consider two sets of entities and their members' mutual affinity values, say
drug-target affinities (DTA). Drugs and targets are said to interact in their
effects on DTAs if drug's effect on it depends on the target. Presence of
interaction implies that assigning a drug to a target and another drug to
another target does not provide the same aggregate DTA as the reversed
assignment would provide. Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables
better decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug
doses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly
done from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on
the entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets. In this paper,
we introduce interaction directions' prediction performance estimator we call
interaction concordance index (IC-index), for both fixed predictors and machine
learning algorithms aimed for inferring them. IC-index complements the
popularly used DTA prediction performance estimators by evaluating the ratio of
correctly predicted directions of interaction effects in data. First, we show
the invariance of IC-index on predictors unable to capture interactions.
Secondly, we show that learning algorithm's permutation equivariance regarding
drug and target identities implies its inability to capture interactions when
either drug, target or both are unseen during training. In practical
applications, this equivariance is remedied via incorporation of appropriate
side information on drugs and targets. We make a comprehensive empirical
evaluation over several biomedical interaction data sets with various
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The experiments demonstrate how
different types of affinity strength prediction methods perform in terms of
IC-index complementing existing prediction performance estimators.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MergeMoE is a method for compressing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models using mathematical optimization to merge experts' outputs, outperforming baselines at the same compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models have substantial memory overhead, making compression an important research direction. Expert merging has been proposed but needs better theoretical foundation and optimization.

Method: Approach expert merging from the perspective of merging experts' outputs rather than parameter aggregation. Interpret merging as inserting additional matrices into forward computation, leading to an optimization formulation. Use mathematical optimization to construct compression matrices.

Result: MergeMoE consistently outperforms baseline methods with the same compression ratios across multiple MoE models.

Conclusion: The optimization-based approach to expert merging provides an effective method for compressing MoE models while maintaining performance.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique has proven to be a promising solution
to efficiently scale the model size, which has been widely applied in recent
LLM advancements. However, the substantial memory overhead of MoE models has
made their compression an important research direction. In this work, we
provide a theoretical analysis of expert merging, a recently proposed technique
for compressing MoE models. Rather than interpreting expert merging from the
conventional perspective of parameter aggregation, we approach it from the
perspective of merging experts' outputs. Our key insight is that the merging
process can be interpreted as inserting additional matrices into the forward
computation, which naturally leads to an optimization formulation. Building on
this analysis, we introduce MergeMoE, a method that leverages mathematical
optimization to construct the compression matrices. We evaluate MergeMoE on
multiple MoE models and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
baselines with the same compression ratios.

### [157] [A Free Lunch in LLM Compression: Revisiting Retraining after Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14444)
*Moritz Wagner,Christophe Roux,Max Zimmer,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper challenges the common practice of avoiding retraining in LLM pruning, showing that reconstructing attention and MLP components separately within transformer blocks achieves better performance than full retraining with much less memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM pruning methods avoid full retraining due to computational costs, but the authors question whether this avoidance is always necessary and investigate optimal reconstruction strategies.

Method: Conducted extensive computational study on GPT architectures, comparing different reconstruction granularities (single matrices vs. transformer blocks) and pruning criteria like Wanda.

Result: Found that reconstructing attention and MLP components separately within each transformer block is Pareto-optimal - achieves best perplexity with minimal resources, outperforming full retraining.

Conclusion: The findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs, showing that proper reconstruction strategies can achieve better performance than full retraining with significantly reduced memory requirements.

Abstract: While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to
recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask
selection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to
avoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs.
Reconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as
convexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements
compared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often
implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer
block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work,
we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining
weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on
state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that
challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we
observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components
separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient
yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup
achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a
fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient
pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when
the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our
findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs
and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.

### [158] [Towards geological inference with process-based and deep generative modeling, part 1: training on fluvial deposits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14445)
*Guillaume Rongier,Luk Peeters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GANs can effectively generate realistic 3D fluvial deposits that honor geological principles like the law of superposition, showing better performance than current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative modeling approaches struggle to reproduce continuous geological structures like fluvial deposits, which is crucial for subsurface resource distribution.

Method: Train a generative adversarial network (GAN) using training data from a process-based model that simulates geological processes, with ablation studies to test transferability from 2D to 3D image generation.

Result: GAN training remained stable, generated samples reproduced non-stationarity and details without mode collapse or memorization, and successfully honored the law of superposition using deposition time.

Conclusion: GANs are more robust than given credit for in generating specific geological structures, and leveraging geological principles shows promise for future applications.

Abstract: The distribution of resources in the subsurface is deeply linked to the
variations of its physical properties. Generative modeling has long been used
to predict those physical properties while quantifying the associated
uncertainty. But current approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological
structures, and fluvial deposits in particular, because of their continuity.
This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of
deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - can be trained to reproduce
fluvial deposits simulated by a process-based model - a more expensive model
that mimics geological processes. An ablation study shows that developments
from the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly
transferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the
generated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits
without mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data. Using a
process-based model to generate those training data allows us to include
valuable properties other than the usual physical properties. We show how the
deposition time let us monitor and validate the performance of a GAN by
checking that its samples honor the law of superposition. Our work joins a
series of previous studies suggesting that GANs are more robust that given
credit for, at least for training datasets targeting specific geological
structures. Whether this robustness transfers to larger 3D images and
multimodal datasets remains to be seen. Exploring how deep generative models
can leverage geological principles like the law of superposition shows a lot of
promise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fundamental trade-offs between model accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability for production deployment in analytical chemistry, particularly for wine classification.

Method: Empirical study using One-vs-Rest logistic regression on UCI Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 chemical features), comparing from-scratch gradient descent against scikit-learn's optimized solvers, and analyzing L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity.

Result: Manual gradient descent achieved 92.59% accuracy, scikit-learn provided 98.15% accuracy with 24x speedup. L1 regularization achieved 54-69% feature reduction with only 4.63% accuracy decrease. Proposed optimal 5-feature subset with 62% complexity reduction and estimated 92-94% accuracy.

Conclusion: L1 regularization provides favorable interpretability-performance trade-offs, enabling cost-effective deployment with significant savings ($80 per sample, 56% time reduction) and robust generalization suitable for real-time quality control.

Abstract: Multi-class wine classification presents fundamental trade-offs between model
accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability - critical factors for
production deployment in analytical chemistry. This paper presents a
comprehensive empirical study of One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the UCI
Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 chemical features), comparing
from-scratch gradient descent implementation against scikit-learn's optimized
solvers and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity. Manual
gradient descent achieves 92.59 percent mean test accuracy with smooth
convergence, validating theoretical foundations, though scikit-learn provides
24x training speedup and 98.15 percent accuracy. Class-specific analysis
reveals distinct chemical signatures with heterogeneous patterns where color
intensity varies dramatically (0.31 to 16.50) across cultivars. L1
regularization produces 54-69 percent feature reduction with only 4.63 percent
accuracy decrease, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance
trade-offs. We propose an optimal 5-feature subset achieving 62 percent
complexity reduction with estimated 92-94 percent accuracy, enabling
cost-effective deployment with 80 dollars savings per sample and 56 percent
time reduction. Statistical validation confirms robust generalization with
sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control. Our findings
provide actionable guidelines for practitioners balancing comprehensive
chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle to faithfully execute molecular modifications when operating on non-intuitive representations like SMILES, despite showing promise in generating high-level editing intentions.

Method: MECo reformulates molecular optimization as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable editing intentions from molecules and property goals, then translating those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation.

Result: Achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing realistic edits, improves consistency by 38-86 percentage points to 90%+, and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines while preserving structural similarity.

Conclusion: MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design by aligning intention with execution, laying foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative human-AI workflows in drug discovery.

Abstract: Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires
precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in
natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these
modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like
SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by
translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular
optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable
editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating
those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our
approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits
derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On
downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and
target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage
points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines
while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution,
MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design,
laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative
human-AI workflows in drug discovery.

TL;DR: ICA framework uses in-context approximation to estimate data value without retraining, enabling efficient data selection and reweighting for improved model alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy or off-target examples can dilute supervision in fine-tuning, and systematic ways to identify high-value training data are underexplored, with current methods relying on heuristics or expensive retraining.

Method: In-Context Approximation (ICA) estimates holdout loss after training on candidate examples by conditioning on small curated holdout set in context, requiring no reference model or additional finetuning. Per-example weights derived from ICA scores dynamically reweight gradient updates.

Result: ICA-based reweighting consistently improves model alignment across SFT, DPO, and SimPO methods, with diverse backbones and datasets, achieving minimal overhead.

Conclusion: ICA provides a theoretically grounded, resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting, though limitations exist for rapidly drifting on-policy updates, highlighting future research directions.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for
aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can
dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the
performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify
high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on
heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a theoretically grounded,
resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is
an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would
incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated
holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional
finetuning. Under a local linearization, ICA is equivalent to a first-order
update toward the holdout optimum, motivating its use as a proxy for data
value. We derive per-example weights from ICA scores, dynamically reweighting
gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and
over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently
improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score
update frequency and the choice of $k$ holdout examples for in-context
demonstrations, and note limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates,
highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.

TL;DR: The Guess2Graph (G2G) framework improves causal discovery with limited samples by using expert guesses to guide statistical tests rather than replacing them, maintaining statistical consistency while enabling performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery algorithms perform poorly with limited samples, and existing methods that integrate expert knowledge require perfect predictions or uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable for practical use.

Method: Proposed Guess2Graph framework with two instantiations: PC-Guess (augments PC algorithm) and gPC-Guess (learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage high-quality expert input). Both use expert guesses to guide the sequence of statistical tests.

Result: Both methods preserve correctness regardless of expert error, with gPC-Guess provably outperforming its non-augmented counterpart in finite samples when experts are 'better than random.' Empirically, both show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with gPC-Guess achieving significantly stronger gains.

Conclusion: The G2G framework provides a practical approach to integrate expert knowledge in causal discovery while maintaining statistical guarantees, with gPC-Guess offering superior performance when expert input is reliable.

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms often perform poorly with limited samples. While

*Andrejs Sorstkins,Omer Tariq,Muhammad Bilal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reversible learning framework for RL agents that uses transition reversibility measures and selective rollback to improve safety and performance by preventing catastrophic actions and reducing value overestimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible environments, where traditional RL agents can take catastrophic actions with poor long-term consequences.

Method: Two core mechanisms: 1) Phi(s,a) - an online estimator quantifying likelihood of returning to prior state within horizon K, used to adjust TD penalty terms; 2) Selective rollback operation that returns agent to preceding state when actions yield unexpectedly low returns, interrupting suboptimal trajectories.

Result: In CliffWalking v0: 99.8% reduction in catastrophic falls, 55% increase in mean episode return. In Taxi v3: ≥99.9% suppression of illegal actions, 65.7% improvement in cumulative reward, significantly reduced reward variance in both environments.

Conclusion: The framework improves safety, performance, and stability in RL, with ablation studies confirming the rollback mechanism as critical for these gains, representing progress toward safe sequential decision making.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reversible learning framework to improve the robustness
and efficiency of value based Reinforcement Learning agents, addressing
vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible
environments. The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an
empirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and
a selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action
estimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior
state within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term
during temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility
awareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a
selective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly
lower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined
threshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather
than progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids
catastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted
rollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the
CliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8
percent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi
v3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9
percent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while
also sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies
confirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these
safety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable
sequential decision making.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Selective Representation Space (SRS) module that uses learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic Reassembly to adaptively select and shuffle time series patches, improving forecasting performance over conventional fixed patching methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional patching techniques partition time series into adjacent patches, creating a fixed representation space that leads to insufficiently expressive representations for time series forecasting.

Method: Proposed SRS module with learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle patches from contextual time series. Also introduced SRSNet model combining SRS with an MLP head.

Result: SRSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains. SRS module also enhances existing patch-based models as a plug-and-play component.

Conclusion: The selective representation space approach effectively exploits contextual time series information and improves forecasting performance in patch-based models.

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of
Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to
effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space
beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching
partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed
representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful
representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a
selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches
for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space
(SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic
Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the
contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of
contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based
models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet
effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains.
Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the
performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for selecting latent dimensions (ranks) in tensor factorization rely on heuristic methods, lacking rigorous theoretical foundations.

Method: Transform moment matching conditions into a log-linear system of equations relating marginal moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; establish equivalence between rank identifiability and system solvability.

Result: PARAFAC/CP, Tensor Train, and Tensor Ring models yield solvable systems (ranks identifiable), while Tucker model leads to underdetermined system (ranks unidentifiable). Derived explicit closed-form rank estimators for identifiable models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a rigorous approach to rank identifiability, with practical estimators for identifiable tensor models that work with observed data moments only.

Abstract: Selecting the latent dimensions (ranks) in tensor factorization is a central
challenge that often relies on heuristic methods. This paper introduces a
rigorous approach to determine rank identifiability in probabilistic tensor
models, based on prior predictive moment matching. We transform a set of moment
matching conditions into a log-linear system of equations in terms of marginal
moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; establishing an equivalence between
rank identifiability and the solvability of such system. We apply this
framework to four foundational tensor-models, demonstrating that the linear
structure of the PARAFAC/CP model, the chain structure of the Tensor Train
model, and the closed-loop structure of the Tensor Ring model yield solvable
systems, making their ranks identifiable. In contrast, we prove that the
symmetric topology of the Tucker model leads to an underdetermined system,
rendering the ranks unidentifiable by this method. For the identifiable models,
we derive explicit closed-form rank estimators based on the moments of observed
data only. We empirically validate these estimators and evaluate the robustness
of the proposal.

TL;DR: AEPO is an agentic RL algorithm that balances entropy in rollout and policy update phases to prevent training collapse from excessive entropy reliance, achieving state-of-the-art results on 14 challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream agentic RL algorithms rely heavily on entropy signals for exploration, but excessive entropy can cause training collapse and impose constraints on tool-use capabilities.

Method: AEPO uses: (1) dynamic entropy-balanced rollout with entropy pre-monitoring and branch penalty for consecutive high-entropy steps; (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization with stop-gradient on high-entropy clipping and entropy-aware advantage estimation.

Result: AEPO outperforms 7 mainstream RL algorithms across 14 datasets. Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, 43.0% on WebWalker for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, 70.0% on WebWalker for Pass@5.

Conclusion: AEPO improves rollout sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, enabling scalable web agent training with better performance than existing methods.

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

*Jungi Lee,Junyong Park,Soohyun Cha,Jaehoon Cho,Jaewoong Sim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MX+ is a cost-effective extension to microscaling (MX) formats that improves 4-bit block floating-point performance for LLM inference by repurposing exponent fields as extended mantissas for outlier elements, achieving better model performance than MXFP4 with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduced-precision formats are essential for efficient LLM serving, but existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle with outlier values in blocks, limiting their practical adoption despite being industry-driven formats.

Method: Proposed MX+ extension for microscaling formats that identifies outliers don't need their exponent fields, allowing repurposing of exponent bits as extended mantissas to increase precision for outlier elements while maintaining non-intrusive integration.

Result: MX+ achieves significantly higher model performance compared to 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage overhead and slowdown, making it a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6.

Conclusion: MX+ provides an effective solution to the outlier problem in ultra low-bit BFP formats, enabling efficient LLM inference with minimal modifications while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Reduced-precision data formats are crucial for cost-effective serving of
large language models (LLMs). While numerous reduced-precision formats have
been introduced thus far, they often require intrusive modifications to the
software frameworks or are rather unconventional for widespread adoption across
hardware vendors. In this paper, we instead focus on recent industry-driven
variants of block floating-point (BFP) formats and conduct a comprehensive
analysis to push their limits for efficient LLM serving. Our analysis shows
that existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle to provide reasonable
language model performance due to outlier values in blocks. To address the
outliers with BFPs, we propose MX+, a cost-effective and non-intrusive
extension designed for seamless integration into the microscaling (MX) formats.
MX+ builds on the key insight that the outlier does not need to use its
exponent field in the element data type, which allows us to repurpose the
exponent field as an extended mantissa to increase the precision of the outlier
element. Our evaluation shows that MX+ achieves significantly higher model
performance compared to the 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage
overhead and slowdown, thus offering a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6
for efficient LLM inference.

*Yue Hou,He Zhu,Ruomei Liu,Yingke Su,Junran Wu,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RedOUT is an unsupervised framework that uses structural entropy to improve OOD detection in graph classification by reducing structural redundancy through a Redundancy-aware Graph Information Bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph OOD detection methods suffer from performance degradation due to structural redundancy that causes semantic shifts between training and test data distributions.

Method: Proposes RedOUT framework with Redundancy-aware Graph Information Bottleneck (ReGIB) that decomposes information into essential and redundant components, minimizing structural entropy with theoretically grounded bounds.

Result: Achieves superior OOD detection performance with 6.7% average improvement and 17.3% better than best competitor on ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.

Conclusion: RedOUT effectively addresses structural redundancy in graph OOD detection through structural entropy minimization, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Distributional discrepancy between training and test data can lead models to
make inaccurate predictions when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples
in real-world applications. Although existing graph OOD detection methods
leverage data-centric techniques to extract effective representations, their
performance remains compromised by structural redundancy that induces semantic
shifts. To address this dilemma, we propose RedOUT, an unsupervised framework
that integrates structural entropy into test-time OOD detection for graph
classification. Concretely, we introduce the Redundancy-aware Graph Information
Bottleneck (ReGIB) and decompose the objective into essential information and
irrelevant redundancy. By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled
redundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are
proposed for optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of RedOUT on OOD detection. Specifically,
our method achieves an average improvement of 6.7%, significantly surpassing
the best competitor by 17.3% on the ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.

TL;DR: Hydra, a bidirectional linear-time SSM, is proposed as an efficient alternative to Transformers in TabPFN for tabular data, reducing order-dependence while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers in foundation models for tabular data suffer from quadratic complexity with sequence length, motivating exploration of more efficient sequence models like SSMs.

Method: Replace Transformers with Hydra, a bidirectional linear-time structured state space model (SSM), to address SSM's sensitivity to input token order through symmetric context aggregation.

Result: The approach reduces order-dependence and achieves predictive performance competitive with the original TabPFN model.

Conclusion: Bidirectional SSMs like Hydra can serve as efficient alternatives to Transformers in tabular foundation models, maintaining performance while reducing computational complexity.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models for tabular data, such as TabPFN,
demonstrated that pretrained Transformer architectures can approximate Bayesian
inference with high predictive performance. However, Transformers suffer from
quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, motivating the
exploration of more efficient sequence models. In this work, we investigate the
potential of using Hydra, a bidirectional linear-time structured state space
model (SSM), as an alternative to Transformers in TabPFN. A key challenge lies
in SSM's inherent sensitivity to the order of input tokens - an undesirable
property for tabular datasets where the row order is semantically meaningless.
We investigate to what extent a bidirectional approach can preserve efficiency
and enable symmetric context aggregation. Our experiments show that this
approach reduces the order-dependence, achieving predictive performance
competitive to the original TabPFN model.

*Huipeng Huang,Wenbo Liao,Huajun Xi,Hao Zeng,Mengchen Zhao,Hongxin Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Conformal Labeling is a method that provides theoretical guarantees for AI-generated labels by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), ensuring a predefined fraction of AI-assigned labels is correct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality human labeling is expensive, while AI labeling has unavoidable errors. Existing selective labeling methods lack theoretical guarantees on AI label quality.

Method: Construct conformal p-values by comparing AI model confidence to mislabeled calibration instances, then select test instances with p-values below a data-dependent threshold to certify trustworthy AI predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments show tight FDR control with high power across image/text labeling and LLM QA tasks.

Conclusion: Conformal Labeling provides provable trust in AI predictions by controlling FDR, addressing the reliability gap in selective labeling approaches.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring
massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective
alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the
unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through
selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder.
However, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of
AI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within
the AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Conformal
Labeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be
provably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In
particular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by
comparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances
mislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are
below a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as
trustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls
the FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of
AI-assigned labels is correct on average. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves tight FDR control with high power across various
tasks, including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing protein-ligand docking methods struggle to balance speed, accuracy, and physical plausibility, creating a need for improved approaches.

Method: Three-stage flow matching pipeline operating on geometric spaces (ℝ³, SO(3), SO(2)) with learned scoring and unsupervised physical validity filtering.

Result: Superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test sets with 25x faster speed than modern co-folding models.

Conclusion: Matcha provides an effective solution for accurate and fast protein-ligand docking with improved physical plausibility.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding poses is crucial for
structure-based drug design, yet existing methods struggle to balance speed,
accuracy, and physical plausibility. We introduce Matcha, a novel molecular
docking pipeline that combines multi-stage flow matching with learned scoring
and physical validity filtering. Our approach consists of three sequential
stages applied consecutively to refine docking predictions, each implemented as
a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces
($\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and $\mathrm{SO}(2)$). We enhance the
prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised
physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various
approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test
sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our
method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding
models. The model weights and inference code to reproduce our results are

TL;DR: MAHA is a modality-aware hybrid retrieval architecture that combines dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal for multimodal question answering, achieving superior performance over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems are limited to unimodal textual data, but real-world documents are multimodal with text, images, tables, equations, and graphs that each provide unique information.

Method: MAHA uses a modality-aware knowledge graph that encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships, integrating dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal for context-aware retrieval across diverse modalities.

Result: MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods on multiple benchmark datasets, achieving a ROUGE-L score of 0.486 with complete modality coverage.

Conclusion: MAHA establishes a scalable and interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data through the combination of embeddings with explicit document structure.

Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on
unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal
documents. Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and
graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a
Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for
multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge
graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal,
where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This
design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across
diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of
0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's
ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling
effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and
interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAL is an efficient transformer architecture that bypasses MHA-MLP connections to eliminate all-reduce communication overhead in tensor parallelism, reducing training time by up to 44% while maintaining or improving model quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer designs suffer from significant communication overhead in tensor parallelism, particularly the all-reduce communication required for each block's MHA-MLP connection, which becomes problematic at billion-scale training.

Method: FAL redirects the first MHA output to the MLP inputs of following layers, eliminating per-block MHA-MLP connections. FAL+ adds normalized first attention output to subsequent MHA outputs to augment MLP input for improved quality.

Result: FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to 44%, improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, and achieves better perplexity than baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity without increasing training time.

Conclusion: The proposed FAL architecture successfully addresses communication bottlenecks in distributed transformer training while maintaining or improving model quality, making it an efficient alternative for large-scale transformer training.

Abstract: As training billion-scale transformers becomes increasingly common, employing
multiple distributed GPUs along with parallel training methods has become a
standard practice. However, existing transformer designs suffer from
significant communication overhead, especially in Tensor Parallelism (TP),
where each block's MHA-MLP connection requires an all-reduce communication.
Through our investigation, we show that the MHA-MLP connections can be bypassed
for efficiency, while the attention output of the first layer can serve as an
alternative signal for the bypassed connection. Motivated by the observations,
we propose FAL (First Attentions Last), an efficient transformer architecture
that redirects the first MHA output to the MLP inputs of the following layers,
eliminating the per-block MHA-MLP connections. This removes the all-reduce
communication and enables parallel execution of MHA and MLP on a single GPU. We
also introduce FAL+, which adds the normalized first attention output to the
MHA outputs of the following layers to augment the MLP input for the model
quality. Our evaluation shows that FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to
44%, improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, and achieves better
perplexity compared to the baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity
without increasing the training time than the baseline.

TL;DR: LeapFactual is a novel counterfactual explanation algorithm using conditional flow matching to generate reliable counterfactuals, overcoming limitations like gradient vanishing and decision boundary misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for interpretable ML/AI models in high-stakes domains like healthcare and scientific research, and the limitations of current counterfactual methods including gradient vanishing and overreliance on decision boundary alignment.

Method: Proposes LeapFactual based on conditional flow matching, which is model-agnostic and can handle non-differentiable models and human-in-the-loop systems.

Result: Extensive experiments show LeapFactual generates accurate, in-distribution counterfactual explanations that provide actionable insights and can be used as new training data to enhance models.

Conclusion: LeapFactual is broadly applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert interpretability in domains requiring human participation.

Abstract: The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research
calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the
existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer
interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a
model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current
counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including
gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the
alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these
limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation
algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable
and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries
diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to
models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop
systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that
require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We
provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that
LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations
that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable
counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially
used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly
applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Galaxy morphology classification is laborious for large datasets, and existing machine learning approaches lack interpretability and insight into decision processes.

Method: Extend classical encoder-decoder architecture with invertible flow to enable counterfactual explanations while maintaining predictive performance.

Result: The proposed approach achieves good predictive performance while providing additional information about the decision process.

Conclusion: The invertible flow extension to encoder-decoder architecture enables both accurate galaxy morphology classification and explainable AI through counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Galaxy morphologies play an essential role in the study of the evolution of
galaxies. The determination of morphologies is laborious for a large amount of
data giving rise to machine learning-based approaches. Unfortunately, most of
these approaches offer no insight into how the model works and make the results
difficult to understand and explain. We here propose to extend a classical
encoder-decoder architecture with invertible flow, allowing us to not only
obtain a good predictive performance but also provide additional information
about the decision process with counterfactual explanations.

*Shayan Gharib,Marcelo Hartmann,Arto Klami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Riemannian geometry approach for unsupervised domain adaptation that matches source and target distributions using symmetric positive definite matrices to simultaneously align first- and second-order moments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing domain adaptation methods use ad-hoc similarity measures for moment matching, lacking principled geometric foundations for distribution alignment.

Method: Proposes using Siegel embeddings to represent first- and second-order moments as SPD matrices, then aligns distributions using Riemannian distance on the SPD manifold.

Result: Validated on image denoising and classification benchmarks, showing improved adaptation performance through principled geometric alignment.

Conclusion: The Riemannian manifold approach provides a more faithful metric for cross-domain comparison by preserving distribution structure and connecting to theoretical error bounds.

Abstract: We address the problem of distribution shift in unsupervised domain
adaptation with a moment-matching approach. Existing methods typically align
low-order statistical moments of the source and target distributions in an
embedding space using ad-hoc similarity measures. We propose a principled
alternative that instead leverages the intrinsic geometry of these
distributions by adopting a Riemannian distance for this alignment. Our key
novelty lies in expressing the first- and second-order moments as a single
symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix through Siegel embeddings. This
enables simultaneous adaptation of both moments using the natural geometric
distance on the shared manifold of SPD matrices, preserving the mean and
covariance structure of the source and target distributions and yielding a more
faithful metric for cross-domain comparison. We connect the Riemannian manifold
distance to the target-domain error bound, and validate the method on image
denoising and image classification benchmarks. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/shayangharib/GeoAdapt.

TL;DR: A low-power online anomaly detection framework using neuromorphic wireless sensor networks with event-driven sensors and IR transmissions, featuring FDR control via e-values and dynamic sensor querying optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient anomaly detection in applications like brain-machine interfaces and environmental monitoring while minimizing power consumption and maintaining strict false discovery rate control.

Method: Uses neuromorphic sensor nodes that produce spikes for relevant changes, impulse radio transmissions for communication, online hypothesis testing with e-values for FDR control, and multi-armed bandit optimization for dynamic sensor querying.

Result: The framework reliably detects anomalies under stringent FDR requirements while efficiently scheduling sensor communications and achieving low detection latency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully combines neuromorphic sensing, online statistical testing, and dynamic optimization to create an effective low-power anomaly detection system with guaranteed FDR control.

Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on
neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as
brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered
system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor
nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are
event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the
monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse
radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The
reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored
environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the
false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The
proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to
maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it
dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm
identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies
under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor
communications and achieving low detection latency.

TL;DR: FedPPA is a novel Personalized Federated Learning method that progressively aligns common layer weights with the global model while preserving local knowledge, addressing both model and data heterogeneity in non-IID settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PFL approaches overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity from clients with diverse computational capabilities, which poses challenges in real-world FL scenarios.

Method: Progressive Parameter Alignment (FedPPA) that aligns common layer weights with global model weights while preserving local knowledge, integrated with entropy-based weighted averaging.

Result: FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, achieving superior personalized adaptation performance.

Conclusion: FedPPA effectively addresses model and data heterogeneity in FL, providing robust personalization while maintaining strong global model performance through progressive alignment and entropy-based averaging.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving
machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however,
clients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold
non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses
significant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)
has emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based
on their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL
approaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity
arising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment
(FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across
clients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates
inconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also
preserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization
robustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance
while retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based
weighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image
classification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate
that FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior
performance in personalized adaptation.

*Alexandru Meterez,Depen Morwani,Jingfeng Wu,Costin-Andrei Oncescu,Cengiz Pehlevan,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Seesaw is a principled batch-size scheduling framework that replaces learning rate decay with batch size ramp-up, reducing wall-clock training time while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batch size ramp-up can accelerate LLM pretraining, but optimal strategies for adaptive optimizers like Adam are unclear, leading to heuristic tuning. A principled approach is needed.

Method: Seesaw framework: when standard scheduler would halve learning rate, instead multiply by 1/√2 and double batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps. Theoretical analysis for SGD and normalized SGD.

Result: On 150M/300M/600M-parameter models at Chinchilla scale, Seesaw matches cosine decay at equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by ≈36%, approaching theoretical limit.

Conclusion: Seesaw provides a principled batch-size scheduling method that significantly accelerates training while maintaining performance, with theoretical foundations for equivalence between learning rate decay and batch size ramp-up.

Abstract: Increasing the batch size during training -- a ''batch ramp'' -- is a
promising strategy to accelerate large language model pretraining. While for
SGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate,
the optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a
result, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned
heuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size
scheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the
learning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the
batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps.
Theoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of
equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy
linear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a
tractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in
practice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla
scale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at
equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\approx 36\%$, approaching the
theoretical limit implied by our analysis.

TL;DR: Tawa is an automated compiler that generates high-performance, warp-specialized GPU code from high-level tile-based programs, using asynchronous references (aref) to abstract warp-level communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The conventional SIMT programming model is misaligned with task-parallel GPU hardware, creating a programmability gap. Manual warp specialization requires complex low-level programming that is labor-intensive and error-prone.

Method: Tawa uses a novel IR abstraction called asynchronous references (aref) to express warp-level communication without exposing hardware details. It automatically partitions programs into producer-consumer roles and manages dataflow pipelines.

Result: On NVIDIA H100 GPUs, Tawa achieves up to 1.1× speedup over cuBLAS GEMM kernels and 1.2× speedup over Triton for attention workloads. It matches the performance of hand-optimized CUTLASS FlashAttention-3 with significantly less programming effort.

Conclusion: Tawa successfully bridges the programmability gap in GPU programming by automating warp specialization, delivering high performance while reducing developer burden.

Abstract: Modern GPUs feature specialized hardware units that enable high-performance,
asynchronous dataflow execution. However, the conventional SIMT programming
model is fundamentally misaligned with this task-parallel hardware, creating a
significant programmability gap. While hardware-level warp specialization is
the key to unlocking peak performance, it forces developers to manually
orchestrate complex, low-level communication and software pipelines--a process
that is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsustainable. To address this
challenge, we present Tawa, an automated compiler that systematically generates
high-performance, warp-specialized code from a high-level, tile-based program.
Central to our approach is a novel IR abstraction, asynchronous references
(aref), which expresses warp-level communication without exposing low-level
hardware details. Using this abstraction, Tawa automatically partitions
programs into producer-consumer roles and manages the intricate dataflow
pipeline, relieving developers of invasive kernel rewriting. Evaluation on
NVIDIA H100 GPUs across representative LLM kernels shows that Tawa delivers
high hardware utilization, achieving up to 1.1$\times$ speedup over highly
optimized cuBLAS GEMM kernels. For attention workloads, Tawa attains
1.2$\times$ speedup over Triton and matches the performance of the
hand-optimized CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3 kernel with far less programming
effort.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools like INDAGO focus only on maximizing failure counts without ensuring diversity of discovered scenarios or revealing distinct error types in safety-critical DRL testing.

Method: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with multiple diversity metrics and Pareto front selection strategies to jointly optimize for failure likelihood and test scenario diversity.

Result: INDAGO-Nexus discovers up to 83% and 40% more unique failures than INDAGO in SDC and Parking scenarios respectively, while reducing time-to-failure by up to 67% across all agents.

Conclusion: Multi-objective optimization approach significantly improves test effectiveness and efficiency for discovering diverse failure scenarios in DRL agents compared to single-objective methods.

Abstract: Testing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in safety-critical domains
requires discovering diverse failure scenarios. Existing tools such as INDAGO
rely on single-objective optimization focused solely on maximizing failure
counts, but this does not ensure discovered scenarios are diverse or reveal
distinct error types. We introduce INDAGO-Nexus, a multi-objective search
approach that jointly optimizes for failure likelihood and test scenario
diversity using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with multiple diversity
metrics and Pareto front selection strategies. We evaluated INDAGO-Nexus on
three DRL agents: humanoid walker, self-driving car, and parking agent. On
average, INDAGO-Nexus discovers up to 83% and 40% more unique failures (test
effectiveness) than INDAGO in the SDC and Parking scenarios, respectively,
while reducing time-to-failure by up to 67% across all agents.

TL;DR: Future Summary Prediction (FSP) improves on next-token and multi-token prediction by training models to predict compact representations of long-term future content, addressing limitations in long-horizon reasoning and creative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Next-token prediction struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative writing due to teacher-forced training limitations, while multi-token prediction only captures short-range dependencies.

Method: FSP trains an auxiliary head to predict compact representations of long-term future content using either handcrafted summaries (e.g., bag of words) or learned summaries from reverse language model embeddings.

Result: Large-scale pretraining experiments with 3B and 8B-parameter models show FSP outperforms both next-token and multi-token prediction across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.

Conclusion: FSP effectively addresses limitations of existing prediction methods by enabling better long-term content modeling, demonstrating significant improvements in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) has driven the success of large language models
(LLMs), but it struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative
writing, with these limitations largely attributed to teacher-forced training.
Multi-token prediction (MTP) partially mitigates these issues by predicting
several future tokens at once, but it mostly captures short-range dependencies
and offers limited improvement. We propose future summary prediction (FSP),
which trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the
long-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We
explore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words
summary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use
embeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left.
Large-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate
that FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning,
and coding benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations: they assume independent latent confounders or cannot properly handle causal relationships among observed variables.

Method: Uses higher-order cumulants of observed data to identify causal structure, allowing causal relationships among latent variables, observed variables, and between them.

Result: Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate the algorithm's validity and practical utility.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully identifies causal DAGs in LvLiNGAM models with more flexible assumptions about latent confounders.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating causal directed acyclic graphs

observed data to identify the causal structure. Extensive simulations and
experiments with real-world data demonstrate the validity and practical utility

TL;DR: An active jammer localization framework using Bayesian optimization with acquisition-aware path planning that guides mobile agents to collect high-utility RSS measurements while considering urban obstacles and mobility constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of passive crowdsourced methods by enabling adaptive, guided data collection for jammer localization in urban environments with obstacles and mobility constraints.

Method: Modified A* algorithm (A-UCB*) that incorporates acquisition values into trajectory costs to plan high-acquisition paths for mobile agents collecting RSS measurements.

Result: Simulations show accurate jammer localization with fewer measurements compared to uninformed baselines, with consistent performance across different urban environments.

Conclusion: The proposed acquisition-aware path planning framework effectively localizes jammers in urban settings while minimizing required measurements and handling environmental constraints.

Abstract: We propose an active jammer localization framework that combines Bayesian
optimization with acquisition-aware path planning. Unlike passive crowdsourced
methods, our approach adaptively guides a mobile agent to collect high-utility
Received Signal Strength measurements while accounting for urban obstacles and
mobility constraints. For this, we modified the A* algorithm, A-UCB*, by
incorporating acquisition values into trajectory costs, leading to
high-acquisition planned paths. Simulations on realistic urban scenarios show
that the proposed method achieves accurate localization with fewer measurements
compared to uninformed baselines, demonstrating consistent performance under
different environments.

*Shikuang Deng,Jiayuan Zhang,Yuhang Wu,Ting Chen,Shi Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPHeRe is a novel unsupervised Hebbian learning method that integrates orthogonality constraints and structural information preservation through local auxiliary nonlinear blocks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on image classification benchmarks while being effective for continual learning and transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Hebbian learning suffers from unconstrained connection updates and lack of feedback mediation, limiting its scalability to complex networks and tasks. SPHeRe addresses these limitations to make Hebbian learning competitive in modern deep learning frameworks.

Method: SPHeRe uses orthogonality constraints to bound update magnitudes and incorporates structural information preservation through local auxiliary nonlinear blocks. A loss for structural preservation backpropagates through an auxiliary lightweight projection that serves as feedback mediation.

Result: SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic plasticity approaches on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. It also shows strong effectiveness in continual learning, transfer learning scenarios, and image reconstruction tasks, demonstrating robust and generalizable feature extraction.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian unsupervised learning rules in modern deep learning, showing that efficient biologically inspired learning algorithms can be developed without strong dependence on strict backpropagation.

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how
neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied
to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates
of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such
shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and
tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian
Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates
orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary
nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation
backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that
conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints
account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental
results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic
plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong
effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image
reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted
features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian
unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks,
demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning
algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation. Our code is

*Abhishek Tyagi,Arjun Iyer,Liam Young,William H Renninger,Christopher Kanan,Yuhao Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PA-DST combines structured sparsity with learned permutations to match unstructured DST accuracy while maintaining GPU efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured sparsity is faster on GPUs but less accurate than unstructured DST due to limited expressivity in fixed patterns like blocks or N:M layouts.

Method: Learn a single permutation matrix per layer jointly with structured weight matrix, applied to block, N:M, and diagonal structures.

Result: Matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90-95% sparsity on ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), with 1.21× faster training and 2.9× faster inference.

Conclusion: Structure + learned permutation provides optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency for sparse training.

Abstract: Structured sparsity accelerates training and inference on modern GPUs, yet it
still trails unstructured dynamic sparse training (DST) in accuracy. The
shortfall stems from a loss of expressivity: whereas a dense layer can realize
every possible mask obtained by choosing any $w$ active weights out of $n$, a
fixed block or N:M layout explores only a subset of those possibilities. We
propose to close this gap by learning, for each layer, a single permutation
matrix jointly with the structured weight matrix. Applied to three canonical
structures -- block, N:M, and diagonals -- we show that permutation-augmented
DST (PA-DST) matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90--95\% sparsity on
ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), yet trains up to $1.21\times$
and infers up to $2.9\times$ faster. The results position structure + learned
permutation as a sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency.

*Zhiyuan Zhao,Haoxin Liu,B. Aditya Prakash*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes ShifTS, a method-agnostic framework that addresses both temporal shift and concept drift in time-series forecasting through a unified approach, using a soft attention mechanism to find invariant patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies primarily focus on temporal shift in time series forecasting, while concept drift methods have received less attention. Conventional concept drift methods face challenges in time-series forecasting, and temporal shift mitigation is critical before addressing concept drift.

Method: ShifTS framework that first tackles temporal shift and then concept drift using a soft attention mechanism to find invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. The framework is method-agnostic and can be applied to various forecasting models.

Result: Extensive experiments show ShifTS consistently enhances forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets, outperforming existing concept drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed ShifTS framework effectively addresses both temporal shift and concept drift in time-series forecasting, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and providing a unified approach to handle distribution shifts.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due
to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series
forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this
paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series:
concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies
primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting,
designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received
comparatively less attention.
  Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional
concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in
time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds
invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we
emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a
preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS,
a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then
concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of
agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept
drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.

*Gabriel Poesia,Georgia Gabriela Sampaio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models combine code-based features synthesized by LLMs with decision trees to create interpretable, efficient predictors competitive with neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between interpretable classical models (like decision trees) that need manual feature engineering and neural networks that learn representations automatically but lack interpretability and require specialized hardware.

Method: Two algorithms: 1) Adaptation of FunSearch to learn features using LLMs, 2) Novel ID3 variant that generates features on-demand during decision tree learning. Features are represented as code functions synthesized by LLMs.

Result: Learned neural network-free predictors competitive with neural networks in tasks including chess position evaluation, image classification, and text classification.

Conclusion: LeaPR provides a flexible paradigm for learning interpretable representations end-to-end where both features and predictions can be readily inspected and understood.

Abstract: Classical models for supervised machine learning, such as decision trees, are
efficient and interpretable predictors, but their quality is highly dependent
on the particular choice of input features. Although neural networks can learn
useful representations directly from raw data (e.g., images or text), this
comes at the expense of interpretability and the need for specialized hardware
to run them efficiently. In this paper, we explore a hypothesis class we call
Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models, which stack arbitrary
features represented as code (functions from data points to scalars) and
decision tree predictors. We synthesize feature functions using Large Language
Models (LLMs), which have rich prior knowledge in a wide range of domains and a
remarkable ability to write code using existing domain-specific libraries. We
propose two algorithms to learn LeaPR models from supervised data. First, we
design an adaptation of FunSearch to learn features rather than directly
generate predictors. Then, we develop a novel variant of the classical ID3
algorithm for decision tree learning, where new features are generated on
demand when splitting leaf nodes. In experiments from chess position evaluation
to image and text classification, our methods learn high-quality, neural
network-free predictors often competitive with neural networks. Our work
suggests a flexible paradigm for learning interpretable representations
end-to-end where features and predictions can be readily inspected and
understood.

TL;DR: SSMs have limitations in long-form generation but can overcome them through tool augmentation, achieving length generalization on arithmetic, reasoning, and coding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the theoretical limitation of SSMs in solving truly long-form generation problems and explore how tool augmentation can overcome this limitation.

Method: Augment SSMs with interactive access to external tools and train them with problem-dependent data to enable learning of tractable problems.

Result: Tool-augmented SSMs achieve remarkable length generalization on arithmetic, reasoning, and coding tasks, demonstrating their potential as efficient alternatives to Transformers.

Conclusion: SSMs with tool access can overcome their theoretical limitations and serve as efficient alternatives to Transformers in interactive tool-based settings.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have become the leading alternative to Transformers
for sequence modeling. Their primary advantage is efficiency in long-context
and long-form generation, enabled by fixed-size memory and linear scaling of
computational complexity. We begin this work by showing a simple theoretical
result stating that SSMs cannot accurately solve any ``truly long-form''
generation problem (in a sense we formally define), undermining their main
competitive advantage. However, we show that this limitation can be mitigated
by allowing SSMs interactive access to external tools. In fact, we show that
given the right choice of tool access and problem-dependent training data, SSMs
can learn to solve any tractable problem and generalize to arbitrary problem
length/complexity (i.e., achieve length generalization). Following our
theoretical finding, we demonstrate that tool-augmented SSMs achieve remarkable
length generalization on a variety of arithmetic, reasoning, and coding tasks.
These findings highlight SSMs as a potential efficient alternative to
Transformers in interactive tool-based and agentic settings.

TL;DR: Proposes ML-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework using LSTM networks for signal quality forecasting in 6G multi-RAT networks to enable proactive handovers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current handover in multi-RAT networks is reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous measurements, which is unreliable under fast channel dynamics, interference, and heterogeneous coverage in 6G networks.

Method: Uses RAT-aware LSTM networks to forecast signal quality indicators along randomized trajectories, with a generalized P-CHO workflow including data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, hysteresis-based decision logic, and CHO execution.

Result: P-CHO with hysteresis reduces handover failures and ping-pong events. The framework enables accurate, low-latency proactive handovers suitable for 6G multi-RAT deployments.

Conclusion: The proposed P-CHO framework can enable accurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted handover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments.

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of 6G multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT)
networks, where cellular and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) transmitters coexist,
requires mobility decisions that remain reliable under fast channel dynamics,
interference, and heterogeneous coverage. Handover in multi-RAT deployments is
still highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous
measurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning
(ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a
model-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a
generalized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,
which standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision
logic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a
realistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along
randomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated
under different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated
coverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under
different system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO
variants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out.
Finally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings,
showing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover
failures and ping-pong events. Overall, the proposed P-CHO framework can enable
accurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted
handover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces stochastic reward machines to handle noisy rewards in reinforcement learning, with a constraint-solving algorithm that learns minimal models from agent explorations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward machine learning algorithms assume noise-free rewards, which is impractical in real-world scenarios where rewards can be noisy.

Method: Developed a novel stochastic reward machine model and a constraint-solving algorithm that learns minimal reward machines from RL agent explorations, compatible with existing RM algorithms.

Result: The algorithm outperforms existing methods and naive approaches for handling noisy rewards in two case studies, and guarantees convergence to optimal policy in the limit.

Conclusion: Stochastic reward machines effectively address the practical limitation of noisy rewards in reinforcement learning, providing a robust framework that integrates well with existing RM methods.

Abstract: Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement
learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences
of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an
overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome
this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called
stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm,
based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the
explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be
paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and
guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms
both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis shows gradient ascent can effectively unlearn specific data points by leveraging gradient descent's implicit bias toward KKT conditions, with formal success criteria and validation on linear models and neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and ethical concerns by removing specific data from trained models without full retraining, using gradient ascent as a practical unlearning method.

Method: Analyze gradient ascent unlearning by leveraging implicit bias of gradient descent toward KKT conditions of margin maximization, with formal (ε,δ,τ)-success criterion for linear models and two-layer neural networks.

Result: Properly scaled gradient ascent satisfies the success criterion and approximates retrained solution on retained data, while preserving generalization in Gaussian-mixture settings.

Conclusion: Gradient ascent provides theoretically grounded and effective machine unlearning that closely matches retrained models while maintaining privacy and generalization.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove specific data from trained models,
addressing growing privacy and ethical concerns. We provide a theoretical
analysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse
the influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch.
Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we
quantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies
these conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a
new success criterion, termed \textbf{$(\epsilon, \delta, \tau)$-successful}
unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks
with high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies
this criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained
solution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs
successful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic
Gaussian-mixture setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to remove backdoors from foundation models without compromising their general capabilities, leveraging the finding that backdoors are disentangled from benign tasks in the weight space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and backdoors, but existing removal methods degrade performance on other tasks. The authors investigate whether backdoors can be removed without compromising general model capabilities.

Method: The method leverages the finding that backdoors are disentangled from benign tasks in the model weight space. It introduces a simple unlearning approach that isolates and erases the backdoor's influence with minimal impact on clean performance.

Result: The method achieves approximately perfect unlearning while retaining 96% of clean accuracy on average. It works even when the attack is unknown by using reverse-engineered triggers.

Conclusion: The proposed method consistently yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs compared to state-of-the-art defenses, demonstrating effective backdoor removal without compromising model capabilities.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad
generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such
vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the
large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.
Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the
harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.
This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without
compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address
this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,
finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this
separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the
model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we
introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.
Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial
triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves
approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean
accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its
presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper
estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently
yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present
state-of-the-art defenses.

*Dhruva Karkada,Joseph Turnbull,Yuxi Liu,James B. Simon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a theoretical framework called Hermite eigenstructure ansatz (HEA) that predicts kernel regression learning curves from data covariance and target function decomposition, showing it works well on real image datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an end-to-end theory that can predict model performance from dataset structure for nontrivial learning algorithms on real datasets.

Method: Analytical approximation of kernel eigenvalues/eigenfunctions using Hermite polynomials (HEA), validated on Gaussian data and applied to real image datasets like CIFAR-5m, SVHN, and ImageNet.

Result: HEA accurately predicts kernel regression learning curves on real image data, and MLPs in feature-learning regime learn Hermite polynomials in the predicted order.

Conclusion: The HEA framework demonstrates that end-to-end learning theories mapping dataset structure to model performance are possible for real-world learning algorithms.

Abstract: We study kernel regression with common rotation-invariant kernels on real
datasets including CIFAR-5m, SVHN, and ImageNet. We give a theoretical
framework that predicts learning curves (test risk vs. sample size) from only
two measurements: the empirical data covariance matrix and an empirical
polynomial decomposition of the target function $f_*$. The key new idea is an
analytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with
respect to an anisotropic data distribution. The eigenfunctions resemble
Hermite polynomials of the data, so we call this approximation the Hermite
eigenstructure ansatz (HEA). We prove the HEA for Gaussian data, but we find
that real image data is often "Gaussian enough" for the HEA to hold well in
practice, enabling us to predict learning curves by applying prior results
relating kernel eigenstructure to test risk. Extending beyond kernel
regression, we empirically find that MLPs in the feature-learning regime learn
Hermite polynomials in the order predicted by the HEA. Our HEA framework is a
proof of concept that an end-to-end theory of learning which maps dataset
structure all the way to model performance is possible for nontrivial learning
algorithms on real datasets.

*Sarah Liaw,Benjamin Plaut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cautious bandit algorithm that learns when to abstain rather than commit actions in high-stakes environments where errors can cause irreparable damage, achieving sublinear regret guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard bandit algorithms assume all errors are recoverable, but in high-stakes AI applications, single actions can cause irreparable damage. Existing approaches rely on mentors that may not always be available.

Method: Formalizes learning as a two-action contextual bandit with abstain option. Proposes a caution-based algorithm that commits only in trusted regions where evidence doesn't certify harm, using Lipschitz assumptions about commit rewards.

Result: Establishes sublinear regret guarantees under i.i.d. inputs, demonstrating that cautious exploration can effectively deploy learning agents safely in high-stakes environments.

Conclusion: Cautious exploration strategies that learn when not to learn can enable safe deployment of learning agents in high-stakes applications without requiring constant mentor availability.

Abstract: In high-stakes AI applications, even a single action can cause irreparable
damage. However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that
all errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit
algorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this
assumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help
from a mentor, but a mentor may not always be available. In this work, we
formalize a model of learning with unbounded rewards without a mentor as a
two-action contextual bandit with an abstain option: at each round the agent
observes an input and chooses either to abstain (always 0 reward) or to commit
(execute a preexisting task policy). Committing yields rewards that are
upper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative, and the commit reward is assumed
Lipschitz in the input. We propose a caution-based algorithm that learns when
not to learn: it chooses a trusted region and commits only where the available
evidence does not already certify harm. Under these conditions and i.i.d.
inputs, we establish sublinear regret guarantees, theoretically demonstrating
the effectiveness of cautious exploration for deploying learning agents safely
in high-stakes environments.

*Aayush Karan,Yilun Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that comparable reasoning capabilities to RL-posttraining can be achieved from base LLMs at inference time using a simple iterative sampling algorithm based on MCMC techniques, without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if base models can achieve reasoning capabilities comparable to RL-posttraining through pure sampling at inference time, avoiding the need for additional training and addressing the diversity collapse issue in RL.

Method: Proposed a simple iterative sampling algorithm inspired by MCMC techniques for sampling from sharpened distributions, leveraging base models' own likelihoods without requiring training, curated datasets, or verifiers.

Result: The algorithm provides substantial reasoning boosts that nearly match or even outperform RL-posttraining on tasks like MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA, while avoiding the diversity collapse characteristic of RL.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains and shows that base models can achieve strong reasoning capabilities through inference-time sampling alone.

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

TL;DR: WeightLens and CircuitLens are two complementary methods that enhance neural network interpretability by analyzing learned weights and feature interactions, overcoming limitations of activation-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability methods rely on manual inspection, are limited to toy tasks, and miss feature interactions. Automated approaches depend heavily on external LLMs and dataset quality.

Method: WeightLens interprets features directly from learned weights without explainer models or datasets. CircuitLens captures how feature activations arise from component interactions, revealing circuit-level dynamics.

Result: WeightLens matches or exceeds existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens identifies circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches miss. Together they increase interpretability robustness.

Conclusion: These methods enhance scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and quality, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit analysis.

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

### [198] [Efficient Parallel Samplers for Recurrent-Depth Models and Their Connection to Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14961)
*Jonas Geiping,Xinyu Yang,Guinan Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a diffusion forcing sampler that accelerates generation in recurrent-depth language models by enabling parallel token refinement through recurrence, achieving up to 5x speedup without tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language models, and leverage their similarities to develop more efficient generation methods that can parallelize the extra computation in recurrent-depth models.

Method: Developed a diffusion forcing sampler that decodes new tokens at every forward pass while allowing latent states to be refined in parallel through recurrence, based on principles from diffusion literature.

Result: The sampler provides strictly more expressive generation than autoregressive baselines with the same time budget, and achieves up to 5x speedup when applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth transformers without any tuning.

Conclusion: Recurrent-depth models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal, diffusion language models, and the proposed sampler provides an efficient mechanism for parallelizing their extra computation at inference.

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

### [199] [Identity-Link IRT for Label-Free LLM Evaluation: Preserving Additivity in TVD-MI Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14966)
*Zachary Robertson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that using identity link functions instead of logistic/probit transformations preserves the additive structure of pairwise comparison data from LLM evaluations, enabling more efficient ranking with fewer comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop more efficient methods for evaluating large language models by preserving the geometric properties of pairwise comparison data and avoiding nonlinear transformations that break additivity.

Method: Proposes using identity link functions with box-constrained least-squares formulation derived from Gini entropy maximization, applied to pairwise comparisons using TVD-MI (total variation distance mutual information).

Result: Achieves holdout RMSE of 0.117 ± 0.008 with 33% coverage (three times fewer evaluations than full dense), preserves agent rankings (Spearman ρ = 0.972 ± 0.015), and shows strong judge robustness (ρ = 0.872 between different judges).

Conclusion: Identity mapping best preserves TVD-MI's geometry for efficient LLM evaluation and is applicable to other bounded-response domains, outperforming traditional logistic/probit transformations.

Abstract: Pairwise comparisons of large language models using total variation distance
mutual information (TVD-MI) produce binary critic decisions per pair. We show
that averaging TVD-MI's binary trials yields centered-probability scores with
additive structure suitable for item-response theory (IRT) without nonlinear
link functions. Maximum-likelihood approaches to IRT use logistic links, but we
find empirically that these transformations introduce curvature that breaks
additivity: across three domains, the identity link yields median curl on raw
data of 0.080-0.150 (P95 = [0.474, 0.580]), whereas probit/logit introduce
substantially higher violations (median [0.245, 0.588], P95 [0.825, 2.252]). We
derive this clipped-linear model from Gini entropy maximization, yielding a
box-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation. At
33% coverage, we achieve holdout RMSE $0.117 \pm 0.008$ while preserving agent
rankings (Spearman $\rho = 0.972 \pm 0.015$), three times fewer evaluations
than full dense. Judge robustness analysis (GPT-4o-mini vs. Llama3-70b) shows
strong agreement in agent rankings ($\rho = 0.872$) and consistent
identity-link advantage. TVD-MI's geometry is best preserved by identity
mapping for efficient LLM evaluation, applicable to other bounded-response
domains.

### [200] [Biology-informed neural networks learn nonlinear representations from omics data to improve genomic prediction and interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14970)
*Katiana Kontolati,Rini Jasmine Gladstone,Ian Davis,Ethan Pickering*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) improve genomic prediction and selection in crops by integrating SNPs with multi-omics data and biological knowledge, achieving up to 56% higher accuracy and identifying nonlinear biological relationships that traditional methods miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional genotype-to-phenotype models have limited accuracy, requiring costly field trials. Models using intermediate molecular phenotypes achieve better fit but are impractical for genomic selection since such data is unavailable during deployment. BINNs overcome this by using multi-omics data only during training while using genotype data alone during inference.

Method: BINNs encode pathway-level inductive biases and leverage multi-omics data during training, but use only genotype data during inference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial data, and tested with synthetic metabolomics benchmark.

Result: BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across subpopulations under sparse-data conditions. With complete domain knowledge, reduces prediction error by 75% relative to conventional neural nets. Identifies genes that GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover and correctly identifies important nonlinear pathways. Latent variables correlate with experimental quantities despite not being trained on them.

Conclusion: BINNs learn biologically-relevant representations from genotype to phenotype and establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological relationships for genomic selection, candidate gene selection, pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.

Abstract: We extend biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) for genomic
prediction (GP) and selection (GS) in crops by integrating thousands of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with multi-omics measurements and prior
biological knowledge. Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend
heavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders
to conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic
gain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene
expression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for
GS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome
this limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging
multi-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during
inference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial
data, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across
subpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes
that GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic
metabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to
conventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear
pathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables
correlate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being
trained on them. This suggests BINNs learn biologically-relevant
representations, nonlinear or linear, from genotype to phenotype. Together,
BINNs establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to
improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological
relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection,
pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.

### [201] [pi-Flow: Policy-Based Few-Step Generation via Imitation Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14974)
*Hansheng Chen,Kai Zhang,Hao Tan,Leonidas Guibas,Gordon Wetzstein,Sai Bi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: π-Flow introduces policy-based flow models that predict dynamic flow velocities for fast ODE integration, achieving state-of-the-art few-step generation with better diversity and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the format mismatch in few-step diffusion/flow models that leads to complex distillation procedures and quality-diversity trade-offs.

Method: Modify student flow model to predict network-free policies that produce dynamic flow velocities at future substeps, enabling fast ODE integration without extra network evaluations. Use imitation distillation with ℓ₂ flow matching loss.

Result: Achieves 1-NFE FID of 2.85 on ImageNet 256², outperforming MeanFlow. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, achieves substantially better diversity while maintaining teacher-level quality.

Conclusion: π-Flow enables stable and scalable training by mimicking teacher behavior, avoiding quality-diversity trade-offs in few-step generative models.

Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a
velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards
denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures
that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we
propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output
layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.
The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with
negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these
substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE
trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation
approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the
policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply
mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable
training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it
attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT
architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves
substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while
maintaining teacher-level quality.

*Raheleh Biglari,Joachim Denil*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DOTechnique is a novel method for determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output similarity, enabling efficient identification of validity regions without predefined boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model validity is critical for decision-making, but traditional approaches rely on predefined validity frames that may be unavailable or insufficient.

Method: Evaluates whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions compared to high-fidelity models, integrating domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the search space.

Result: Successfully demonstrated on a highway lane change system, uncovering the validity region of a simulation model.

Conclusion: DOTechnique has potential to support finding model validity through decision-maker context, offering an efficient alternative to traditional validity assessment methods.

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding
decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined
validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper
introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for
determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output
similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions
compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification
of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The
approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the
search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system
serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the
validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of
the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

### [203] [Do Slides Help? Multi-modal Context for Automatic Transcription of Conference Talks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13979)
*Supriti Sinhamahapatra,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-modal ASR system that integrates visual information from presentation slides to improve speech recognition accuracy, especially for domain-specific terminology in scientific presentations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA ASR systems rely only on acoustic information and ignore multi-modal context, while visual information from slides can help disambiguate and adapt recognition, particularly for domain-specific terms in scientific presentations.

Method: Created a benchmark for multi-modal presentations, developed methods to augment speech models with slide information, used data augmentation to overcome dataset limitations, and trained models on the augmented dataset.

Result: Achieved 34% relative reduction in word error rate overall and 35% reduction for domain-specific terms compared to baseline model.

Conclusion: Integrating presentation slide information with acoustic data significantly improves ASR performance, especially for domain-specific terminology in scientific contexts.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

### [204] [Do Large Language Models Show Biases in Causal Learning? Insights from Contingency Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13985)
*María Victoria Carro,Denise Alejandra Mester,Francisca Gauna Selasco,Giovanni Franco Gabriel Marraffini,Mario Alejandro Leiva,Gerardo I. Simari,María Vanina Martinez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large language models show systematic susceptibility to causal illusions in null contingency scenarios, inferring unwarranted causal relationships despite insufficient evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether LLMs develop causal illusions similar to human cognitive biases when faced with contingency judgment tasks, particularly in medical contexts where accurate causal reasoning is crucial.

Method: Constructed a dataset of 1,000 null contingency scenarios in medical contexts and prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes using the classic contingency judgment paradigm from cognitive science.

Result: All evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal relationships, revealing strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.

Conclusion: Findings support the hypothesis that LLMs reproduce causal language without true comprehension, raising concerns about their use in domains requiring accurate causal reasoning for informed decision-making.

Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of
making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by
normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the
illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between
two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been
proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,
stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,
we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal
illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency
judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null
contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to
establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and
prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings
show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal
relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.
While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality
or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings
support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language
models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed
decision-making.

*Rajesh Mangannavar,Prasad Tadepalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GammaZero introduces an action-centric graph representation framework for POMDP planning that enables zero-shot generalization to larger problem sizes using learned structural patterns from small problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches require domain-specific neural architectures and struggle with scalability, needing a unified framework that can generalize across problem sizes within a domain.

Method: Transforms belief states into action-centric graphs, uses graph neural network with decoder architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations on small problems, then applies learned heuristics to guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to BetaZero on same-sized problems while enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger than training instances, maintaining solution quality with reduced search requirements.

Conclusion: GammaZero's action-centric graph representation provides an effective framework for scalable POMDP planning that transfers learned structural patterns from small to large problem instances.

Abstract: We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to
guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures
and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief
representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a
domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed
into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems
transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder
architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations
on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to
guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on
standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable
performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems,
while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger
than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced
search requirements.

*Shriyash Upadhyay,Chaithanya Bandi,Narmeen Oozeer,Philip Quirke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes mandating AI labs to release small analog models (scaled-down versions) of their large proprietary models to enable safety verification and innovation without full model disclosure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about safety regulation costs and the safety-innovation tradeoff by creating an alternative regulatory approach that promotes both safety and innovation.

Method: Require large AI labs to release small, openly accessible analog models trained similarly to and distilled from their largest proprietary models, serving as public proxies for safety research.

Result: Enables broad participation in safety verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency while reducing regulatory burden and accelerating safety advancements.

Conclusion: This policy minimizes additional costs while significantly contributing to public good, demonstrating that deeper model understanding relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff, allowing for both safety and innovation.

Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns
about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been
shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an
alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting
innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly
accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and
distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety
verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without
forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates
that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models
generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider
research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible
analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates
safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources
like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public
good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates
a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper
understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have
more of both.

### [207] [Generating Fair Consensus Statements with Social Choice on Token-Level MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14106)
*Carter Blair,Kate Larson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-objective MDP framework for consensus statement generation with provable fairness guarantees using social choice theory principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM frameworks lack structure for provable fairness guarantees when aggregating diverse opinions, requiring a principled approach to ensure fair consensus generation.

Method: Models the task as token-level MDP with each agent's preference as an objective. Uses social choice theory: stochastic policy for ex-ante core guarantee (maximizing Nash Welfare) and search algorithms for single statement generation (maximizing egalitarian welfare).

Result: Empirical experiments show search guided by egalitarian objective generates consensus statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline methods including Habermas Machine.

Conclusion: The MDP formulation combined with social choice theory provides a principled framework for fair consensus generation with provable guarantees, demonstrating practical improvements in worst-case alignment.

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

TL;DR: STEMS is a safety-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management that combines spatial-temporal graph representation learning with Control Barrier Functions to ensure operational safety while optimizing energy costs and emissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-building energy systems face challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal dependencies, lack rigorous safety guarantees, and have system complexity issues that hinder effective coordinated energy management for carbon reduction and cost savings.

Method: Proposes STEMS framework with two core components: (1) GCN-Transformer fusion architecture for spatial-temporal graph representation learning to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm using Control Barrier Functions for mathematical safety guarantees.

Result: STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework shows strong robustness during extreme weather and effectiveness across different building types.

Conclusion: STEMS provides an effective solution for coordinated building energy management by successfully addressing spatial-temporal dependency exploitation and safety constraints, demonstrating significant improvements in cost, emissions, and safety performance while maintaining occupant comfort.

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals,
improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building
energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal
dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.
Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient
spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,
and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe
Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.
STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph
representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture
to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a
safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier
Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on
real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over
existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission
reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while
maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework
also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and
maintains effectiveness across different building types.

*Edoardo Allegrini,Ananth Shreekumar,Z. Berkay Celik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A unified modeling framework for agentic AI systems that addresses fragmentation in inter-agent communication protocols through formal host agent and task lifecycle models, enabling systematic verification of safety, liveness, and coordination properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic AI systems suffer from fragmented communication protocols (MCP for tools, A2A for coordination) creating semantic gaps that prevent rigorous analysis and introduce security risks, architectural misalignment, and exploitable coordination issues.

Method: Two foundational models: (1) host agent model formalizing user interaction, task decomposition, and orchestration; (2) task lifecycle model detailing sub-task states and transitions from creation to completion. Properties defined in temporal logic for formal verification.

Result: Defined 17 properties for host agent and 14 for task lifecycle across liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness categories. Enables detection of coordination edge cases, prevention of deadlocks and security vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: First rigorously grounded, domain-agnostic framework for systematic analysis, design, and deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems through unified semantic framework and formal verification capabilities.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A lightweight multimodal architecture fusing sensor data and visual imagery to predict degradation severity at cultural heritage sites, achieving 76.9% accuracy with simplified PerceiverIO and Adaptive Barlow Twins loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change, but traditional unimodal monitoring (visual inspection or environmental sensors alone) fails to capture the complex interplay between environmental stressors and material deterioration.

Method: Proposes a lightweight multimodal architecture adapting PerceiverIO with simplified encoders (64D latent space) to prevent overfitting on small datasets, and Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality complementarity rather than redundancy.

Result: Achieves 76.9% accuracy on Strasbourg Cathedral data, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal architectures and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO. Sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. Optimal moderate correlation target (τ=0.3) achieves 69.2% accuracy.

Conclusion: Architectural simplicity combined with contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven conservation decision support systems.

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic

Conclusion: CodeEvolve successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of combining evolutionary algorithms with LLMs for complex problem solving, and the framework is released as open-source to foster collaboration.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce CodeEvolve, an open-source evolutionary coding
agent that unites Large Language Models (LLMs) with genetic algorithms to solve
complex computational problems. Our framework adapts powerful evolutionary
concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized
scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to
maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel
inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to
combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting
strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous
evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to
evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that
our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems.
To foster collaboration and accelerate progress, we release our complete
framework as an open-source repository.

TL;DR: The paper explores combining reinforcement learning with behavior trees to create viable NPCs for commercial video games, addressing the slow adoption of RL in gaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the slow adoption of reinforcement learning in commercial video games and explore the intersection of RL with traditional behavior trees as a practical solution.

Method: Using AMD Schola plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine, creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by "The Last of Us", with detailed methodologies for joint training of RL models with behavior trees.

Result: Demonstrated the viability of combining RL with behavior trees for creating NPCs with various skills in complex 3D game environments.

Conclusion: The RL+behavior tree intersection represents a crucial and viable approach that should be further explored to bridge the gap between RL research and practical game development.

Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research
community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains
slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces
when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL
with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored
further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research
papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach
using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by
creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial
video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly
training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Systematic exploration of multimodal depression detection using EEG, speech, and text modalities, showing that trimodal models with pretrained embeddings achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depression detection studies lack systematic feature comparisons, suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols, and have limited scope in exploring multimodal approaches.

Method: Systematically evaluated feature representations (handcrafted vs pretrained embeddings), neural encoders, unimodal/bimodal/trimodal configurations, and fusion strategies with consistent subject-independent splits for robust benchmarking.

Result: Combination of EEG, speech and text enhances detection; pretrained embeddings outperform handcrafted features; carefully designed trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The work establishes foundation for future multimodal depression detection research by providing systematic comparisons and reproducible evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

### [214] [JEDA: Query-Free Clinical Order Search from Ambient Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14169)
*Praphul Singh,Corey Barrett,Sumana Srivasta,Amitabh Saikia,Irfan Bulu,Sri Gadde,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JEDA is a bi-encoder system that retrieves clinical orders directly from ambient dialogue using joint embedding of commands and context, eliminating the need for LLM rewriting and enabling real-time order processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems rely on LLM rewriting for clinical order processing, which introduces latency, instability, and opacity that hinder real-time ordering in clinical conversations.

Method: JEDA uses a domain-initialized bi-encoder from PubMedBERT with duplicate-safe contrastive objective, trained with constrained LLM guidance to align heterogeneous intent expressions to shared order concepts. It operates in both direct retrieval and query-free modes using rolling dialogue windows.

Result: JEDA achieves large performance gains, substantially outperforming base encoder and recent open embedders. The query-free mode is noise-resilient and reduces sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors.

Conclusion: JEDA provides a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient clinical context to actionable orders in real time, overcoming limitations of existing LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with
implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for
pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability,
and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding
for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that
retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short
rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from
PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA
aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training
uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary
formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning),
producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order
coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient,
reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short
window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large
gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders
(Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The
result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient
context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

*Roger Creus Castanyer,Faisal Mohamed,Pablo Samuel Castro,Cyrus Neary,Glen Berseth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARM-FM is a framework that uses foundation models to automatically generate reward machines from natural language specifications for reinforcement learning, enabling compositional reward design and zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning algorithms are highly sensitive to reward function specification, which limits their broad applicability. Current methods require manual reward design, which is challenging and time-consuming.

Method: Uses foundation models to automatically generate reward machines (automata-based formalism) from natural language specifications. Associates language embeddings with each automata-state to enable generalization across tasks.

Result: Empirical evidence shows ARM-FM's effectiveness in diverse challenging environments, including zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: ARM-FM provides an automated approach for compositional reward design in RL that leverages foundation models' reasoning capabilities, addressing the central challenge of reward function specification.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward
function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad
applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation
Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that
leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs).
Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification
-- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are
automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs
yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective
specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically
generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language
embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks;
and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse
suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot
generalization.

### [217] [Echoes of Human Malice in Agents: Benchmarking LLMs for Multi-Turn Online Harassment Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14207)
*Trilok Padhi,Pinxian Lu,Abdulkadir Erol,Tanmay Sutar,Gauri Sharma,Mina Sonmez,Munmun De Choudhury,Ugur Kursuncu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating LLM agent vulnerability to multi-turn harassment attacks, showing that jailbreak tuning dramatically increases attack success rates and reduces refusal rates, with closed-source models being particularly vulnerable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current jailbreak research focuses on single-turn prompts, but real harassment occurs over multiple interactions, creating a need for multi-turn evaluation frameworks.

Method: Created Online Harassment Agentic Benchmark with synthetic multi-turn harassment dataset, multi-agent simulation based on game theory, three jailbreak methods (memory, planning, fine-tuning), and mixed-methods evaluation using LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-flash.

Result: Jailbreak tuning increased attack success rates to 95.78-96.89% vs 57.25-64.19% without tuning in Llama, and 99.33% vs 98.46% in Gemini. Refusal rates dropped to 1-2%. Most prevalent toxic behaviors were Insult (84.9-87.8% vs 44.2-50.8%) and Flaming (81.2-85.1% vs 31.5-38.8%).

Conclusion: Multi-turn, theory-grounded attacks successfully mimic human-like harassment dynamics, highlighting the urgent need for robust safety guardrails to protect online platforms.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive
web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak
research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment
often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online
Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn
harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)
simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods
attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a
mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our
results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an
attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,
and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal
rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with
84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.
31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive
categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further
reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as
Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies
with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit
distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models
showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn
and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic
human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety
guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

*Fikresilase Wondmeneh Abebayew*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Gatekeeper Protocol addresses LLM limitations in autonomous agents by using a latent state approach and JSON-based interaction protocol to improve reliability, efficiency, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs as autonomous agents face constraints from limited context windows and state desynchronization, leading to unreliable output and inefficient resource usage when interacting with complex knowledge systems.

Method: Introduces a domain-agnostic framework where agents first operate on minimalist latent state representations, then strategically request high-fidelity context through a unified JSON format that ensures state synchronization.

Result: Significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction with complex systems.

Conclusion: Creates a foundational methodology for building more robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,
yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context
window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature
and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable
output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly
when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such
as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the
Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs
agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate
and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the
system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All
interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a
declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the
system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the
Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this
approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational
efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction
with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more
robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge
domain.

TL;DR: LiveResearchBench is a benchmark for evaluating deep research systems that require extensive web search and synthesis, with DeepEval providing comprehensive evaluation metrics for citation-grounded reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to adequately evaluate deep research systems that need to search and synthesize information from hundreds of web sources, lacking user-centric, dynamic, unambiguous, and search-intensive tasks.

Method: Created LiveResearchBench with 100 expert-curated tasks across daily life, enterprise, and academia, requiring dynamic web search and synthesis. Developed DeepEval suite with four evaluation protocols covering content and report quality.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems revealed current strengths, recurring failure modes, and identified key system components needed for advancement.

Conclusion: The benchmark and evaluation suite provide a rigorous foundation for systematically advancing reliable deep research capabilities in agentic systems.

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by
searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources --
marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this
ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric,
reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date
information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent
interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive,
requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing
benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or
posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these
principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated
tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive,
dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of
human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic
evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce
DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level
quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,
consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary
evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high
agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems,
including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent
systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and
key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

*Wangtao Sun,Xiang Cheng,Jialin Fan,Yao Xu,Xing Yu,Shizhu He,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic Self-Learning (ASL) is a closed-loop RL framework that enables LLM-based agents to self-improve without human data or rule-based rewards, using co-evolving generative reward models and scalable synthetic task data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable LLM-based agent training without relying on human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards, addressing limitations of current approaches that plateau or degrade.

Method: Proposes Agentic Self-Learning (ASL) - a multi-role reinforcement learning framework with Prompt Generator, Policy Model, and Generative Reward Model that co-evolve in a closed-loop system within a shared tool environment.

Result: ASL delivers steady performance gains, surpasses RLVR baselines like Search-R1, continues improving under zero-labeled-data conditions, and shows superior sample efficiency and robustness. GRM verification capacity is identified as the main bottleneck.

Conclusion: Reward source and data scale are critical for open-domain agent learning, and multi-role co-evolution enables scalable, self-improving agents. Continual GRM training and small real data injection further enhance performance.

Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on
human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled
experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of
scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent
task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform
rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM
with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task
data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic
Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning
framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within
a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,
a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of
harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,
ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines
(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under
zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and
robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main
bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual
GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small
late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.
This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for
open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role
co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents. The data and code of this
paper are released at

TL;DR: MorphoBench is a dynamic benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities of large models that adapts difficulty based on model performance and includes multidisciplinary questions from Olympiad competitions and simulation-generated problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning benchmarks are limited in scope and lack flexibility to adapt difficulty as models evolve, creating a need for more comprehensive and adaptive evaluation tools.

Method: Curated complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks and Olympiad competitions, adaptively modified question difficulty using key statements from model reasoning processes, and included simulation-generated questions for dynamic difficulty adjustment.

Result: Created a benchmark with over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted difficulty based on models like o3 and GPT-5, enhancing evaluation comprehensiveness and validity.

Conclusion: MorphoBench provides reliable guidance for improving reasoning abilities and scientific robustness of large models through its adaptive and comprehensive evaluation framework.

Abstract: With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly
important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning
abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility
to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the
models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates
multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large
models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning
abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by
selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks
and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench
adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key
statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it
includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic
adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have
gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of
MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.
MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning
evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning
abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released

*Bingjie Zhang,Yibo Yang,Renzhe,Dandan Guo,Jindong Gu,Philip Torr,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GuardSpace is a framework that preserves safety alignment in LLMs during fine-tuning by decomposing weights into safety-relevant and irrelevant components, and using a null space projector to prevent harmful updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' safety alignment is fragile and easily degraded during fine-tuning, leading to harmful responses even when using benign data or low-rank adaptation methods.

Method: Uses covariance-preconditioned SVD to decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and irrelevant components, initializes adapters from safety-irrelevant parts while freezing safety-relevant ones, and employs a null space projector to restrict adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts.

Result: GuardSpace outperforms existing methods, reducing average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6% and improving accuracy from 26.0% to 28.0% for Llama-2-7B-Chat fine-tuned on GSM8K.

Conclusion: GuardSpace effectively preserves safety alignment throughout fine-tuning while maintaining or improving model performance on downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse
tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when
fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety
behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned
models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework
for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key
components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.
First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and
safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value
decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant
ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated
safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts
adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby
maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained
models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves
superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat
fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,
reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the
accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

TL;DR: Terrarium is a framework for studying safety, privacy, and security in LLM-based multi-agent systems, using a modular testbed with configurable attack scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-powered multi-agent systems can automate complex tasks but introduce new risks including misalignment, malicious attacks, and data theft that need systematic study.

Method: Repurposed the blackboard design from early multi-agent systems to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent collaboration, identifying key attack vectors and implementing three collaborative scenarios with four representative attacks.

Result: Developed a flexible framework that enables rapid prototyping, evaluation, and iteration on defenses and designs for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: Terrarium accelerates progress toward trustworthy multi-agent systems by providing tools to systematically study and address safety, privacy, and security challenges.

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MASC is a metacognitive framework for multi-agent systems that enables real-time error detection and self-correction to prevent cascading errors in collaborative problem solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems are brittle to cascading errors where a single faulty step can propagate across agents and disrupt the entire problem-solving trajectory.

Method: MASC uses two complementary designs: (1) Next-Execution Reconstruction to predict next step embeddings for causal consistency, and (2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement that learns a prototype prior over normal-step embeddings to stabilize anomaly scoring under sparse context. When anomalies are detected, a correction agent revises outputs before downstream propagation.

Result: On the Who&When benchmark, MASC improved step-level error detection by up to 8.47% AUC-ROC and delivered consistent end-to-end gains across diverse MAS architectures with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: Metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can effectively mitigate error propagation in multi-agent systems, confirming the framework's ability to enhance system robustness.

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative
problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step
can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we
present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,
unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks
detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:
(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next
step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and
(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over
normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly
scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is
flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output
before information flows downstream. On the Who&When benchmark, MASC
consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by
up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers
consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our
metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation
with minimal overhead.

TL;DR: AI4Service introduces proactive AI assistance through Alpha-Service framework, enabling real-time service intervention from egocentric video without explicit user commands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI services are reactive, responding only to explicit commands. The authors argue for proactive AI that anticipates user needs and takes appropriate actions automatically.

Method: Alpha-Service framework with five components inspired by von Neumann architecture: Input Unit (perception), Central Processing Unit (task scheduling), Arithmetic Logic Unit (tool utilization), Memory Unit (personalization), and Output Unit (human interaction). Implemented as multi-agent system on AI glasses.

Result: Case studies demonstrate successful applications including real-time Blackjack advisor, museum tour guide, and shopping fit assistant, showing ability to perceive environment, infer intent, and provide timely assistance without explicit prompts.

Conclusion: Alpha-Service represents a shift from reactive to proactive AI assistance, enabling seamless, real-time service intervention through unified framework deployed on wearable AI glasses.

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

### [226] [Can MLLMs Absorb Math Reasoning Abilities from LLMs as Free Lunch?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14387)
*Yijie Hu,Zihao Zhou,Kaizhu Huang,Xiaowei Huang,Qiufeng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IP-Merging is a tuning-free method that enables multi-modal LLMs to directly absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs by identifying reasoning-associated parameters, projecting them into MLLM's subspace, and merging while maintaining alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Math reasoning performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) lags behind text-only LLMs, and current model-merging approaches overlook the alignment gap between MLLM and LLM parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.

Method: IP-Merging identifies reasoning-associated parameters in both MLLM and Math LLM, projects them into MLLM's subspace to maintain alignment, and merges parameters in this subspace without requiring tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments show IP-Merging successfully enhances math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising their other capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed IP-Merging method effectively transfers math reasoning abilities from specialized LLMs to MLLMs through parameter identification, projection, and merging in aligned subspaces, without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs),
where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However,
most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and
intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning
performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM
typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly
absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?
Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,
they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there
is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.
Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the
identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the
mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we
propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in
both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to
maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.
IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the
math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising
their other capabilities.

### [227] [Hi-Agent: Hierarchical Vision-Language Agents for Mobile Device Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14388)
*Zhe Wu,Hongjin Lu,Junliang Xing,Changhao Zhang,Yin Zhu,Yuhao Yang,Yuheng Jing,Kai Li,Kun Shao,Jianye Hao,Jun Wang,Yuanchun Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hi-Agent is a hierarchical vision-language agent for mobile control that achieves SOTA performance on Android benchmarks through joint optimization of high-level reasoning and low-level action models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobile agent approaches lack structured reasoning and planning, leading to poor generalization to novel tasks and unseen UI layouts. Direct state-to-action mappings are insufficient for complex mobile control scenarios.

Method: Hierarchical architecture with high-level reasoning model and low-level action model jointly optimized. Reformulates multi-step decision-making as sequence of single-step subgoals with foresight advantage function that uses low-level execution feedback to guide high-level optimization.

Result: Achieves 87.9% task success rate on Android-in-the-Wild benchmark, significantly outperforming prior methods (AppAgent: 17.7%, Filtered BC: 54.5%, DigiRL: 71.9%). Shows competitive zero-shot generalization on ScreenSpot-v2 and scales effectively on AndroidWorld benchmark.

Conclusion: Hi-Agent's hierarchical design with joint optimization and foresight advantage function enables stable training and strong performance in mobile control tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted
increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most
existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack
structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or
unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical
vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning
model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient
training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of
single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which
leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level
optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables
stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark,
significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based
(AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement
learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot
generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging
AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones,
showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.

*Xikai Zhang,Bo Wang,Likang Xiao,Yongzhi Li,Quan Chen,Wenju Wu,Liu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The IMAGINE framework integrates Multi-Agent System reasoning capabilities into a single compact model through end-to-end training, achieving superior performance with smaller model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with complex reasoning and planning tasks, and while Multi-Agent Systems offer improved collective reasoning, they suffer from high reasoning costs, multi-round interactions, long latency, and training difficulties.

Method: Propose IMAGINE framework that integrates MAS reasoning and planning capabilities into one compact model through simple end-to-end training, enabling a single small-scale model to acquire structured reasoning abilities.

Result: A Qwen3-8B-Instruct model trained with IMAGINE achieves 82.7% Final Pass Rate on TravelPlanner benchmark, significantly outperforming DeepSeek-R1-671B's 40% while maintaining much smaller model size.

Conclusion: IMAGINE successfully integrates MAS capabilities into single models, enabling compact models to surpass both individual LLMs and well-organized MAS in complex reasoning tasks with reduced computational costs.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

*Claudia Grundke,Gabriele Röger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a transformation method to eliminate negative occurrences of derived predicates in PDDL axioms, showing that stratifiable axioms can express the same queries as the PDDL standard's restricted approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the discrepancy between the PDDL standard's restriction on negative predicate occurrences in axioms and the common practice of using stratifiable axioms in literature, demonstrating their equivalence.

Method: Developed a transformation technique that converts stratifiable axioms with negative occurrences of derived predicates into equivalent forms that comply with PDDL standards.

Result: Proved that both approaches (PDDL standard restrictions and stratifiable axioms) can express exactly the same queries as least fixed-point logic.

Conclusion: Negative occurrences of derived predicates in PDDL axioms can be eliminated through transformation, validating the equivalence between the standard's restrictive approach and the more flexible stratifiable approach used in practice.

Abstract: Axioms are a feature of the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL that can
be considered as a generalization of database query languages such as Datalog.
The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies
to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In
the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require
that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the
same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences
of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding
transformation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Helmsman is a multi-agent system that automates the synthesis of federated learning systems from high-level specifications, using collaborative planning, code generation, and autonomous evaluation to overcome design complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces critical bottlenecks in designing robust systems due to complexity in handling data heterogeneity and system constraints, leading to brittle solutions.

Method: Three-phase approach: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, (3) autonomous evaluation and refinement in sandboxed simulation. Also introduces AgentFL-Bench benchmark.

Result: Generated solutions are competitive with and often superior to established hand-crafted baselines across 16 diverse tasks.

Conclusion: Represents a significant step towards automated engineering of complex decentralized AI systems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on
decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense
complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select,
combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data
heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck,
resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce
Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of
federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a
principled research and development workflow through three collaborative
phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound
research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a
closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation
environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce
AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess
the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with,
and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents
a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized
AI systems.

### [231] [JSPLIT: A Taxonomy-based Solution for Prompt Bloating in Model Context Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14537)
*Emanuele Antonioni,Stefan Markovic,Anirudha Shankar,Jaime Bernardo,Lovro Markovic,Silvia Pareti,Benedetto Proietti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JSPLIT is a taxonomy-driven framework that reduces prompt bloating in LLM agents by organizing tools hierarchically and selecting only relevant tools based on the user's query, improving efficiency and task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM agents increasingly interact with external tools through protocols like MCP, prompt bloating becomes a major problem - longer prompts lead to higher token costs, increased latency, and reduced task success due to irrelevant tool inclusion.

Method: JSPLIT organizes MCP tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools based on both the query content and taxonomy structure.

Result: JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt size without compromising agent effectiveness. As tool sets grow, it even improves tool selection accuracy, reducing costs while improving task success in complex agent environments.

Conclusion: JSPLIT effectively addresses prompt bloating in agentic systems by leveraging hierarchical taxonomy and intelligent tool selection, enabling more efficient and successful LLM agent operations with large tool sets.

Abstract: AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are
concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond
simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's
applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a
shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools
by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the
prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a
growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts
become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and
reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the
prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework
designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large
sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and
uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,
based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe
the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used
to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt
size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond
effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows
substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,
effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in
high-complexity agent environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper provides an overview of Reasoning Shortcuts (RSs) in neuro-symbolic AI, where models achieve high accuracy by incorrectly grounding concepts, compromising interpretability and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scattered literature on Reasoning Shortcuts in neuro-symbolic AI and provide a unified perspective to help researchers and practitioners understand and tackle this challenging problem.

Method: The paper offers a gentle introduction to RSs, discusses their causes and consequences, reviews theoretical characterizations, and details methods for dealing with RSs including mitigation and awareness strategies.

Result: The overview reformulates advanced material in digestible form, providing a unifying perspective on RSs to lower the entry barrier for tackling them in neuro-symbolic AI systems.

Conclusion: This overview aims to contribute to the development of reliable neuro-symbolic and trustworthy AI models by providing comprehensive understanding of Reasoning Shortcuts and strategies to address them.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

*Asen Nachkov,Xi Wang,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores whether LLM agents can evolve from problem-solving tools into autonomous entities capable of planning, task generation, and reasoning toward ambiguous goals through open-ended experimentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if LLM agents can become autonomous entities that plan, design tasks, and reason toward broader goals, moving beyond their current role as problem-solving tools.

Method: Augment a pretrained LLM agent with capabilities to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with its environment in an open-ended experimental setting.

Result: The agent can reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, but remains sensitive to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form self-representations.

Conclusion: The findings show both promise and current limitations in adapting pretrained LLMs for open-endedness, pointing to future directions for training agents in memory management, productive exploration, and pursuit of abstract long-term goals.

Abstract: Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and
function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can
this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in
its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward
broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended
experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability
to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with
its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can
reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information
across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive
to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form
self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current
limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future
directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and
pursue abstract long-term goals.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ColorBench is a graph-structured benchmarking framework that enables static simulation of dynamic mobile device interactions to evaluate multimodal agents on complex long-horizon tasks with multiple valid solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mobile agent evaluation methods are inadequate - offline benchmarks only validate single predefined paths while online testing is constrained by device complexity and non-reproducibility, making comprehensive assessment difficult.

Method: Developed ColorBench, a benchmark that models finite states from real-device interactions to achieve static simulation of dynamic behaviors. It contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with average length over 13 steps, each including multiple correct paths and typical error paths for quasi-dynamic interaction.

Result: By evaluating various baselines on ColorBench, the study discovered limitations of existing models and identified improvement directions for complex long-horizon problems.

Conclusion: ColorBench bridges the gap between offline and online evaluation, enhances testing stability, and enables comprehensive assessment of agent capabilities including multiple solution validation, subtask completion analysis, and atomic-level capability evaluation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

*Rikard Rosenbacke,Carl Rosenbacke,Victor Rosenbacke,Martin McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rose-Frame, a three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in human-AI interaction, addressing LLMs' tendency toward hallucination and lack of grounded reasoning by reframing alignment as cognitive governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs inherit ambiguity, bias, and lack of direct access to truth from language itself, generating outputs through statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning, which creates risks of hallucination and convincing but factually invalid responses.

Method: Introduces Rose-Frame framework with three axes: (1) Map vs. Territory (epistemology vs ontology), (2) Intuition vs. Reason (dual-process theory), and (3) Conflict vs. Confirmation (critical testing vs mutual validation). It's a reflective tool rather than technical fix.

Result: Provides a diagnostic framework that makes both model limitations and user assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically aware AI deployment by capturing distinct failure modes and their combined misalignment effects.

Conclusion: Alignment should be reframed as cognitive governance where intuition (human or artificial) must remain governed by human reason, requiring reflective, falsifiable oversight to align machine fluency with human understanding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human
communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and
lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs
are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through
statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of
hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.
Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition
rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1
cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection
or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a
three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in
human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which
distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself
(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to
separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)
Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested
through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each
dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies
misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.
Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations
and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically
aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,
whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by
embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with
human understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning promises to revolutionize public health but may inadvertently reinforce existing health disparities without systematic attention to algorithmic bias.

Method: Developed the Risk of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating established frameworks and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Also introduced a four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness, Conceptualization, Application, Reporting).

Result: Analysis revealed pervasive gaps: most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and transparent discussion of potential harms, although data sampling and missing data practices are well documented.

Conclusion: Provides actionable recommendations for public health ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity rather than undermine it.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through
improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However,
without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently
reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature
review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch
public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk
of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from
established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible
AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals
pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well
documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and
transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a
four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness,
Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from
our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across
the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health
ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster
transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity

*Marco Simoni,Aleksandar Fontana,Andrea Saracino,Paolo Mori*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TITAN is a framework that connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a structured knowledge graph derived from MITRE, enabling bidirectional reasoning between threats, behaviors, and defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional retrieval systems lack the ability to perform logical reasoning over cyber threat intelligence, limiting their effectiveness in answering complex security questions that require understanding relationships between threats, behaviors, and defenses.

Method: TITAN integrates a path planner model that predicts logical relation chains from text and a graph executor that traverses the TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers with supporting evidence. It operates on a typed, bidirectional graph derived from MITRE data.

Result: Empirical evaluations show TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph. The framework includes a dataset of 88,209 examples for training and evaluation.

Conclusion: TITAN provides an effective framework for automated cyber threat intelligence reasoning that bridges natural language queries with executable graph-based reasoning, offering clear advantages over traditional retrieval systems through its bidirectional reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

*Bianca Maria Lerma,Rafael Peñaloza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NAEL is a non-anthropocentric ethical framework for AI agents that combines active inference and symbolic reasoning to enable emergent ethical behavior in multi-agent environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of human-centered AI ethics by developing a framework that doesn't presuppose anthropomorphic moral intuitions and allows for context-sensitive, adaptive ethical behavior.

Method: Neuro-symbolic architecture combining active inference (minimizing global expected free energy) with symbolic reasoning for ethical evaluation in uncertain multi-agent environments.

Result: The framework enables dynamic balancing of self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare, as demonstrated in a case study on ethical resource distribution.

Conclusion: NAEL provides a novel approach to AI ethics that allows agents to develop relational ethical behavior without relying on human-centric moral assumptions.

Abstract: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical
framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic
reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics,
NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent
systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent
environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to
evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The
proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by
allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical
behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study
involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of
self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.

### [239] [Practical, Utilitarian Algorithm Configuration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14683)
*Devon Graham,Kevin Leyton-Brown*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COUP is a utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure with strong theoretical guarantees but poor practical performance. This paper improves COUP's empirical performance while maintaining theoretical guarantees, making it competitive with heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical performance in utilitarian algorithm configuration, making COUP competitive with heuristic configuration procedures that lack performance guarantees.

Method: A series of improvements to the COUP algorithm that enhance its empirical performance without degrading its theoretical guarantees, tested experimentally.

Result: The improved COUP algorithm achieves competitive performance with widely used heuristic configuration procedures while maintaining its theoretical performance guarantees.

Conclusion: The enhanced COUP brings theoretically-grounded utilitarian algorithm configuration to practical competitiveness, and case studies demonstrate robustness analysis of algorithm selection solutions to utility function variations.

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a
given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a
theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under
uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over
algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a
solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing
returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced
utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to
offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it
returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper
closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm
configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic
configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a
series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without
degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit
experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the
robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations
in the utility function.

### [240] [Purifying Task Vectors in Knowledge-Aware Subspace for Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14697)
*Bang An,Yibo Yang,Philip Torr,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PAVE is a plug-and-play method that purifies task vectors by removing redundant components in knowledge-aware subspace to improve model merging performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model merging suffers from performance degradation due to task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors, and existing methods use random dropping without knowledge awareness.

Method: Use training examples to get covariance matrices, perform context-oriented SVD to identify task-relevant components, and prune redundant components using spectral rank allocation with normalized activated pruning error.

Result: PAVE effectively improves performance across various merging methods, tasks, and model architectures.

Conclusion: Task vector purification in knowledge-aware subspace is an effective plug-and-play solution for enhancing model merging performance.

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually
fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model
merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can
encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model
often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused
by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming
redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves
randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this
study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.
Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into
their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before
linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,
which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.
As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and
redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task
vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts
across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by
optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification
by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task
vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,
tasks, and model architectures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoAST is a framework that enhances next POI recommendation by aligning LLMs with geographical and temporal patterns through continued pretraining and cognitive alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack understanding of structured geographical entities and mobility patterns needed for POI recommendation, and incorporating world knowledge and human cognition can improve user experience and performance.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition via continued pretraining on enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data, (2) Cognitive Alignment using SFT and RL to align with human preferences.

Result: Extensive offline experiments on real-world datasets and online deployment in AMAP App demonstrate effectiveness.

Conclusion: CoAST successfully addresses LLM limitations in POI recommendation by incorporating spatial-temporal knowledge and cognitive alignment.

Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the
users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical
check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,
which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these
LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the
native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential
mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in
industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and
alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,
and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance
the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address
these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a
framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the
incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,
profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of
2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued
pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the
desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with
human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline
experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in
"Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoAST.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes ToolPRM, an inference scaling framework with fine-grained beam search and process reward model for improving LLM function calling performance through step-level supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference scaling research focuses on unstructured outputs, leaving structured outputs like function calling underexplored, creating a gap in applying these techniques to autonomous agent interactions.

Method: Combines fine-grained beam search with ToolPRM process reward model that scores internal steps of function calls, trained on a fine-grained intra-call process supervision dataset automatically annotated with function-masking techniques.

Result: ToolPRM outperforms coarse-grained and outcome reward models in predictive accuracy, and inference scaling with ToolPRM significantly improves backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Reveals key principle for applying inference scaling to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong
capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core
mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling
has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating
more computational resources during the inference process. However, current
research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output
generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function
calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference
scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward
model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.
To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process
supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques
to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome
reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger
capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference
scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the
backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and
benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference
scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to
the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

*Ruotian Peng,Yi Ren,Zhouliang Yu,Weiyang Liu,Yandong Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SimKO addresses RLVR's over-concentration bias by asymmetrically boosting top-K candidates for correct responses and penalizing top-1 for incorrect ones, improving pass@K performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR methods show systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance due to probability concentration effects.

Method: SimKO (Simple Pass@K Optimization) asymmetrically boosts probabilities of top-K candidates for verified-correct responses and applies stronger penalties to top-1 candidate for verified-incorrect responses, especially at high-entropy tokens.

Result: Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, effectively mitigating over-concentration and improving exploration.

Conclusion: SimKO provides a simple yet effective method to improve RLVR's exploration capabilities by addressing the probability concentration issue, leading to better pass@K performance across diverse reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing
RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as
evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To
understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking
the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our
analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1
candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of
other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with
worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K
Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration
issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical
manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the
top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger
penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is
particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens
with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO
consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way
to improve RLVR's exploration.

*Dominik Jehle,Lennart Purucker,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Datalake Agent is an agentic system that reduces token usage in NL2SQL tasks by using an interactive loop to selectively request only necessary database meta-information, achieving up to 87% token reduction while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NL2SQL methods using LLMs require processing large amounts of database meta-information, resulting in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs.

Method: Instead of direct solvers that call LLMs once with all meta-information, Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop within a reasoning framework where the LLM selectively requests only necessary information for table question answering tasks.

Result: Evaluation on 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks shows the agent reduces LLM tokens by up to 87%, enabling substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: Datalake Agent provides an efficient approach to NL2SQL by reducing token usage through selective information retrieval, making LLM-based SQL generation more cost-effective.

Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL)
has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to
perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates
processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in
turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To
address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed
to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing
direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in
the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the
utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning
framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a
table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection
of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent
reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for
substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RoboGPT-R1 is a two-stage fine-tuning framework that combines supervised training and reinforcement learning to improve embodied agents' reasoning for long-horizon manipulation tasks, achieving significant performance gains over larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision language models struggle with long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex real-world environments due to limited common sense and reasoning capabilities, and supervised fine-tuning alone suffers from poor generalization and insufficient physical understanding.

Method: A two-stage fine-tuning framework: supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences, followed by RL with a rule-based reward function that considers long-horizon performance and action constraints to improve visual-spatial understanding and reasoning.

Result: The model trained on Qwen2.5-VL-3B outperforms GPT-4o-mini by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the EmbodiedBench benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage fine-tuning approach with RL and rule-based rewards effectively enhances embodied agents' reasoning capabilities for complex manipulation tasks, demonstrating that smaller models can outperform larger ones with proper training methodology.

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots
to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks
successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language
models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue
facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex
real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning
capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models
to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor
generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,
a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,
supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,
followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial
understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action
sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based
reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and
action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on
Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,
by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the
EmbodiedBench benchmark.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Boosting is a post-generation method that improves LLM reliability in following prompt instructions, showing up to 7-point improvement for two instructions and 4-point improvement for ten instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prompt manipulation through adding instructions provides little assurance they will be followed, requiring a method to increase instruction following reliability.

Method: Introduced Instruction Boosting as a post-generation technique and created SCALEDIF benchmark with up to ten instructions per sample. Also developed a quantitative conflict scoring tool to analyze instruction tension.

Result: Instruction Boosting improves instruction following rate significantly. Analysis shows performance degrades with more instructions due to tension and conflict between them.

Conclusion: Instruction Boosting effectively increases LLM reliability in following instructions, and the conflict scoring tool helps developers understand the impact of additional instructions on model performance.

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an
application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or
modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides
little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction
Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt
instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction
following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for
ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a
benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data
sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that
performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important
factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that
arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative
conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and
provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt
instructions have on a model's performance.

*Zhuo-Yang Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A formal theory for measuring LLM-assisted iterative search with domain priors, representing agents as fuzzy relation operators constrained by safety envelopes, and analyzing reachability through coverage generating functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically encode domain priors into operationally structured hypothesis spaces for LLM-based iterative search, addressing the limitation that search effectiveness depends on proper domain encoding.

Method: Represent agents as fuzzy relation operators constrained by safety envelopes, weight reachable paths with continuation parameters to create coverage generating functions, measure reachability difficulty, and validate via majority-vote instantiation.

Result: Developed a compact formal theory that provides geometric interpretation of search on graph structures induced by safety envelopes, with testable inferences validated through instantiation.

Conclusion: The theory offers a workable language and operational tools to systematically measure agents and their search spaces, providing a formal description of LLM-constructed iterative search.

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning agent that self-improves schema mapping for enterprise logs without labeled data or model updates, using web searches for external evidence and confidence-based rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise systems need to integrate logs from multiple vendors, but vendor documentation is often unavailable, misplaced, or incomplete, making schema mapping challenging.

Method: Reinforcement learning agent that: 1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts, 2) Generates targeted web-search queries for external evidence, 3) Applies confidence-based rewards to iteratively refine mappings without labeled examples or model weight updates.

Result: Increased mapping accuracy from 56.4% (LLM-only) to 72.73% (RAG) to 93.94% over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. Reduced low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85%. Demonstrated on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs converted to common schema.

Conclusion: Provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving industry problems, enabling more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient, flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

Abstract: The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous
third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However,
vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,
mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping
challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve
without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent:
1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted
web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based
reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we
converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method
increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\%
over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of
low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach
provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry
problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient,
flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

TL;DR: Discriminative verification combined with self-consistency outperforms costly generative verification under fixed compute budgets, achieving up to 15.3% higher accuracy on AIME2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative verification methods for test-time scaling are computationally expensive and impractical for real-world applications, creating a need for more budget-aware alternatives.

Method: Proposed a hybrid approach combining discriminative verifiers with self-consistency, shifting from generative to discriminative verification for more efficient test-time scaling.

Result: Under fixed compute budget, the hybrid discriminative approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generative verification, achieving up to 15.3% higher accuracy on AIME2025.

Conclusion: Budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a free upgrade over self-consistency but also a more effective and efficient alternative to costly generative techniques for practical applications.

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

*Akira Okutomi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a feedback stability theory, introducing H-Risk metric to measure inference instability. It shows higher H-Risk predicts overconfident errors in simulations and correlates with miscalibration/hallucination in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge Kantian philosophy with control theory by viewing reason as a regulator that maintains inference within experiential bounds, providing a principled framework to diagnose and reduce overconfidence in reasoning systems.

Method: Developed composite instability index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity, and innovation amplification. Tested on linear-Gaussian simulations and extended to analyze large language models' internal dynamics and prompt effects.

Result: Higher H-Risk predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability. In LLMs, fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration and hallucination. Critique-style prompts show mixed effects on calibration and hallucination.

Conclusion: The work establishes a structural bridge between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a diagnostic lens for identifying and selectively reducing overconfidence in reasoning systems.

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

Motivation: Existing Process Reward Models (PRMs) face challenges with noisy rewards, low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning due to reliance on costly human labeling, hallucination-prone LLM self-evaluation, or credit misattribution in Monte Carlo estimation.

Method: Uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to construct structured reasoning paths, validates intermediate steps with external tools for execution-grounded correctness, and employs hybrid reward aggregation combining tool verification with MCTS feedback in a generative, rationale-enhanced format.

Result: Achieves up to 26% relative improvement on ProcessBench with only 40K automatically labeled samples (10% of data used by best-performing PRM). When used for reward-guided greedy search, outperforms PRMs trained with human-labeled supervision.

Conclusion: GroundedPRM provides a scalable and verifiable approach for high-quality process-level reasoning, addressing key limitations of existing PRMs through tree-guided structure and fidelity-aware supervision.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying
errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of
scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human
labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes
and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit
misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,
low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To
address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and
fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward
noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured
reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated
supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,
providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level
validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation
mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.
Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative
structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned
LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,
amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with
auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative
improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided
greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled
supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality
process-level reasoning.

### [253] [Agentic Design of Compositional Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14980)
*Wenqian Zhang,Weiyang Liu,Zhen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether large language models can learn machine design by creating BesiegeField, a testbed for compositional machine assembly, and explores reinforcement learning to improve LLM performance on spatial reasoning and physical design tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if large language models can learn to create complex machines through compositional design, building on recent LLM advances and connecting to human engineering intelligence.

Method: Introduces BesiegeField testbed built on the Besiege game for part-based construction and physical simulation. Benchmarks state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and explores reinforcement learning finetuning using a curated cold-start dataset.

Result: Identifies key capabilities required for success (spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, instruction-following) and finds current open-source models fall short, highlighting the need for improvement through RL.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning shows promise as a path to improve LLM performance on machine design tasks, but challenges remain at the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

### [254] [Towards Unified Multimodal Misinformation Detection in Social Media: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25991)
*Haiyang Li,Yaxiong Wang,Shengeng Tang,Lianwei Wu,Lechao Cheng,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for detecting both human-crafted misinformation and AI-generated fake content in multimodal posts, addressing the limitation of existing specialized systems that only handle one type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research treats human-crafted misinformation and AI-generated fake content separately, with NLP focusing on the former and CV on the latter. This specialization limits effectiveness in real-world scenarios where the type of deceptive content is unknown.

Method: Proposes UMFDet framework using a VLM backbone with Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts Adapter to capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism for implicit reasoning guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments show UMFDet achieves robust and consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming specialized baselines.

Conclusion: UMFDet provides a practical unified solution for real-world multimodal deception detection that handles both human-crafted and AI-generated fake content effectively.

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

### [256] [Incomplete Multi-view Clustering via Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13887)
*Xiaojian Ding,Lin Zhao,Xian Li,Xiaoying Zhu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: HSACC is a novel incomplete multi-view clustering framework that uses hierarchical semantic alignment and cooperative completion to address missing views, achieving superior performance through dual-level semantic spaces and dynamic view weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep incomplete multi-view clustering methods suffer from static fusion strategies and two-stage pipelines, leading to suboptimal fusion results and error propagation issues when dealing with samples that have entirely missing views.

Method: HSACC uses a dual-level semantic space design: low-level space ensures consistency alignment via mutual information maximization, while high-level space dynamically assigns adaptive view weights based on distributional affinity and performs weighted fusion. It implicitly recovers missing views by projecting aligned representations into high-dimensional spaces and jointly optimizes reconstruction and clustering objectives.

Result: HSACC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of hierarchical alignment and dynamic weighting, while parameter analysis shows robustness to hyperparameter variations.

Conclusion: The proposed HSACC framework effectively addresses incomplete multi-view clustering challenges through hierarchical semantic alignment and cooperative completion, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data, where certain views are entirely missing for some
samples, poses significant challenges for traditional multi-view clustering
methods. Existing deep incomplete multi-view clustering approaches often rely
on static fusion strategies or two-stage pipelines, leading to suboptimal
fusion results and error propagation issues. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes a novel incomplete multi-view clustering framework based on
Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion (HSACC). HSACC
achieves robust cross-view fusion through a dual-level semantic space design.
In the low-level semantic space, consistency alignment is ensured by maximizing
mutual information across views. In the high-level semantic space, adaptive
view weights are dynamically assigned based on the distributional affinity
between individual views and an initial fused representation, followed by
weighted fusion to generate a unified global representation. Additionally,
HSACC implicitly recovers missing views by projecting aligned latent
representations into high-dimensional semantic spaces and jointly optimizes
reconstruction and clustering objectives, enabling cooperative learning of
completion and clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that HSACC
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the hierarchical alignment and
dynamic weighting mechanisms, while parameter analysis confirms the model's
robustness to hyperparameter variations.

*Akarsh Prabhakara,Yawen Liu,Aswin C. Sankaranarayanan,Anthony Rowe,Swarun Kumar*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Umbra is a mmWave high resolution imaging system that uses rotating mmWave 'inverse pinholes' to enhance angular resolution for static compact radars, achieving 2.5° resolution with a single antenna - 5× improvement over baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static mount compact mmWave radars face limited angular resolution due to their small form factor, which hinders their effectiveness in applications like hovering drones where high-resolution imaging is needed.

Method: The system introduces rotating mmWave 'inverse pinholes' that are lightweight and enable low-power rotation. It also leverages propellers in aerial vehicles as natural inverse pinholes for high-resolution imaging during hovering.

Result: Umbra achieves 2.5° angular resolution with just a single antenna, representing a 5× improvement compared to the 14° resolution from a compact mmWave radar baseline.

Conclusion: The inverse pinhole concept effectively upgrades static-mount radars by significantly enhancing angular resolution while maintaining the benefits of compact size and low power consumption.

Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) radars are popular for perception in vision-denied
contexts due to their compact size. This paper explores emerging use-cases that
involve static mount or momentarily-static compact radars, for example, a
hovering drone. The key challenge with static compact radars is that their
limited form-factor also limits their angular resolution. This paper presents
Umbra, a mmWave high resolution imaging system, that introduces the concept of
rotating mmWave "inverse pinholes" for angular resolution enhancement. We
present the imaging system model, design, and evaluation of mmWave inverse
pinholes. The inverse pinhole is attractive for its lightweight nature, which
enables low-power rotation, upgrading static-mount radars. We also show how
propellers in aerial vehicles act as natural inverse pinholes and can enjoy the
benefits of high-resolution imaging even while they are momentarily static,
e.g., hovering. Our evaluation shows Umbra resolving up to 2.5$^{\circ}$ with
just a single antenna, a 5$\times$ improvement compared to 14$^{\circ}$ from a
compact mmWave radar baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust facial rig inversion system that can generalize from synthetic to scanned data for faithful facial reconstructions.

Method: Uses two independent Hiera transformer backbones to process RGB appearance and RGB-encoded normal maps, then fuses features to regress 102 FACS-based rig parameters.

Result: The method successfully generalizes to scanned data and produces faithful facial reconstructions.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-modal approach using RGB and normal maps with transformer backbones enables effective rig inversion that transfers well from synthetic to real scanned data.

Abstract: We present an image-based rig inversion framework that leverages two
modalities: RGB appearance and RGB-encoded normal maps. Each modality is
processed by an independent Hiera transformer backbone, and the extracted
features are fused to regress 102 rig parameters derived from the Facial Action
Coding System (FACS). Experiments on synthetic and scanned datasets demonstrate
that the method generalizes to scanned data, producing faithful

TL;DR: RL4Seg3D is an unsupervised domain adaptation framework that uses reinforcement learning for 2D+time echocardiography segmentation, improving accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency without requiring target domain labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliability issues in domain adaptation for medical image segmentation, particularly in spatio-temporal echocardiography data where temporal consistency and anatomical validity are critical, and artifacts/noise degrade performance.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with novel reward functions and fusion scheme to enhance landmark precision in full-sized echocardiography videos, providing robust uncertainty estimation as a side effect.

Result: Outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques on over 30,000 echocardiographic videos, demonstrating improved segmentation performance without target domain labels.

Conclusion: RL4Seg3D effectively bridges domain gaps in echocardiography segmentation, providing accurate, anatomically valid, and temporally consistent results with built-in uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Domain adaptation methods aim to bridge the gap between datasets by enabling
knowledge transfer across domains, reducing the need for additional expert
annotations. However, many approaches struggle with reliability in the target
domain, an issue particularly critical in medical image segmentation, where
accuracy and anatomical validity are essential. This challenge is further
exacerbated in spatio-temporal data, where the lack of temporal consistency can
significantly degrade segmentation quality, and particularly in
echocardiography, where the presence of artifacts and noise can further hinder
segmentation performance. To address these issues, we present RL4Seg3D, an
unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D + time echocardiography
segmentation. RL4Seg3D integrates novel reward functions and a fusion scheme to
enhance key landmark precision in its segmentations while processing full-sized
input videos. By leveraging reinforcement learning for image segmentation, our
approach improves accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while
also providing, as a beneficial side effect, a robust uncertainty estimator,
which can be used at test time to further enhance segmentation performance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on over 30,000 echocardiographic
videos, showing that it outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques
without the need for any labels on the target domain. Code is available at

*Siva Teja Kakileti,Bharath Govindaraju,Sudhakar Sampangi,Geetha Manjunath*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A density-informed multi-modal AI framework combining mammography and thermal imaging improves breast cancer detection by dynamically selecting the optimal modality based on breast tissue density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mammography has reduced sensitivity in women with dense breast tissue, leading to missed or delayed diagnoses. Thermal imaging provides complementary functional data that could overcome this limitation.

Method: 324 women underwent both mammography and thermal imaging. The framework uses Mammography AI for fatty breasts and Thermalytix AI for dense breasts, with mammography analyzed by multi-view deep learning and thermal imaging assessed through vascular and thermal radiomics.

Result: The multi-modal AI achieved 94.55% sensitivity and 79.93% specificity, outperforming standalone mammography AI (81.82% sensitivity, 86.25% specificity) and Thermalytix AI (92.73% sensitivity, 75.46% specificity). Mammography sensitivity dropped significantly in dense breasts (67.86%) versus fatty breasts (96.30%), while Thermalytix maintained consistent sensitivity in both (92.59% and 92.86%).

Conclusion: The density-informed multi-modal AI framework overcomes limitations of unimodal screening, delivering high performance across diverse breast compositions. It is interpretable, low-cost, and easily deployable for improving breast cancer screening outcomes.

Abstract: Mammography, the current standard for breast cancer screening, has reduced
sensitivity in women with dense breast tissue, contributing to missed or
delayed diagnoses. Thermalytix, an AI-based thermal imaging modality, captures
functional vascular and metabolic cues that may complement mammographic
structural data. This study investigates whether a breast density-informed
multi-modal AI framework can improve cancer detection by dynamically selecting
the appropriate imaging modality based on breast tissue composition. A total of
324 women underwent both mammography and thermal imaging. Mammography images
were analyzed using a multi-view deep learning model, while Thermalytix
assessed thermal images through vascular and thermal radiomics. The proposed
framework utilized Mammography AI for fatty breasts and Thermalytix AI for
dense breasts, optimizing predictions based on tissue type. This multi-modal AI
framework achieved a sensitivity of 94.55% (95% CI: 88.54-100) and specificity
of 79.93% (95% CI: 75.14-84.71), outperforming standalone mammography AI
(sensitivity 81.82%, specificity 86.25%) and Thermalytix AI (sensitivity
92.73%, specificity 75.46%). Importantly, the sensitivity of Mammography
dropped significantly in dense breasts (67.86%) versus fatty breasts (96.30%),
whereas Thermalytix AI maintained high and consistent sensitivity in both
(92.59% and 92.86%, respectively). This demonstrates that a density-informed
multi-modal AI framework can overcome key limitations of unimodal screening and
deliver high performance across diverse breast compositions. The proposed
framework is interpretable, low-cost, and easily deployable, offering a
practical path to improving breast cancer screening outcomes in both
high-resource and resource-limited settings.

Conclusion: EdgeNavMamba successfully enables efficient and accurate goal-directed navigation on edge devices through model compression and efficient object detection, demonstrating practical deployment potential for autonomous navigation systems.

Abstract: Deployment of efficient and accurate Deep Learning models has long been a
challenge in autonomous navigation, particularly for real-time applications on
resource-constrained edge devices. Edge devices are limited in computing power

train and evaluate the detector, we introduce a custom shape detection dataset
collected in diverse indoor settings, reflecting visual cues common in
real-world navigation. The object detector serves as a pre-processing module,
extracting bounding boxes (BBOX) from visual input, which are then passed to an
RL policy to control goal-oriented navigation. Experimental results show that
the student model achieved a reduction of 67% in size, and up to 73% in energy
per inference on edge devices of NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi 5,
while keeping the same performance as the teacher model. EdgeNavMamba also
maintains high detection accuracy in MiniWorld and IsaacLab simulators while
reducing parameters by 31% compared to the baseline. In the MiniWorld
simulator, the navigation policy achieves over 90% success across environments

TL;DR: This paper analyzes information flow in multilayer perceptrons using information theory, introduces an information matrix framework, and reveals MLPs act as "adaptors" that process inputs according to learning objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how information flows through neural network layers and analyze information processing in supervised learning contexts, which is crucial for advancing artificial neural network research.

Method: Developed an information matrix framework to study information flow and optimization strategies, comparing it with the information bottleneck approach.

Result: Found strong similarities between the proposed information matrix optimization strategy and the information bottleneck framework, and discovered that MLPs function as "adaptors" that process input data according to given objectives.

Conclusion: Multilayer perceptrons serve as adaptive processors that transform input information based on learning objectives, with the information matrix providing a formal framework for understanding optimization strategies and information flow dynamics.

research for this article has also produced several key outcomes: i) the
definition of a parametric optimisation strategy, ii) the finding that the
optimisation strategy proposed in the information bottleneck framework shares
strong similarities with the one derived from the information matrix, and iii)
the insight that a multilayer perceptron serves as a kind of "adaptor", meant

### [263] [Structure-Preserving Error-Correcting Codes for Polynomial Frames](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13882)
*Baigang Chen,Dongfang Zhao*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes structure-preserving error correction for polynomial frames that operates directly in the polynomial ring domain, avoiding format conversions and round-trip delays while correcting symbol errors and burst errors through algebraic coding techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern computational systems frequently move polynomial frames across components, but conventional error detection/correction methods are ill-suited for low-latency pipelines - detect-and-retransmit adds round-trip delays, while byte-stream ECC ignores algebraic structure and requires format conversions.

Method: Two complementary algebraic coding schemes: one for odd-length frames using Hensel-lifted BCH ideal with idempotent encoder, and one for power-of-two length frames using repeated-root negacyclic code with derivative-style decoding. Ring automorphism provides in-place interleaving to disperse burst errors.

Result: Achieves per-frame failure target of 10^-9 at symbol error rates 10^-6 to 10^-5 with t=8-9, incurring only 0.20%-1.56% overhead and tolerating ~32-72 byte unknown-error bursts (doubled when flagged as erasures) after interleaving.

Conclusion: By aligning error correction with ring semantics, this work provides a practical step toward deployable robustness for polynomial-frame computations from an algebraic coding perspective, enabling structure-preserving reliability without format changes or round-trip delays.

Abstract: Modern FFT/NTT analytics, coded computation, and privacy-preserving ML
interface routinely move polynomial frames across NICs, storage, and
accelerators. However, even rare silent data corruption (SDC) can flip a few
ring coefficients and cascade through downstream arithmetic. Conventional
defenses are ill-matched to current low-latency pipelines:
detect-and-retransmit adds RTTs, while byte-stream ECC ignores the algebraic
structure and forces format conversions. To that end, we propose a
structure-preserving reliability layer that operates in the encoded data's
original polynomial ring, adds a small amount of systematic redundancy, and
corrects symbol errors/flagged erasures without round-trip or format changes.
We construct two complementary schemes: one for odd length $N_{odd}$ via a
Hensel-lifted BCH ideal with an idempotent encoder, and one for power-of-two
length $N_{2^m}$ via a repeated-root negacyclic code with derivative-style
decoding. In particular, to stay robust against clustered errors, a ring
automorphism provides in-place interleaving to disperse bursts. Implementation
wise, on four frame sizes $N\!=\!1024, 2048, 4096, 8192$, we meet a per-frame
failure target of $10^{-9}$ at symbol error rates $10^{-6}\text{--}10^{-5}$
with $t\!=\!8\text{--}9$, incurring only $0.20\%\text{--}1.56\%$ overhead and
tolerating $\sim\!32\text{--}72$\,B unknown-error bursts (roughly doubled when
flagged as erasures) after interleaving. By aligning error correction with ring
semantics, we take a practical step toward deployable robustness for
polynomial-frame computations from an algebraic coding perspective.

*Xiao Zheng,Wenchi Cheng,Jingqing Wang,Zhuohui Yao,Jiangzhou Wang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new element-wise RIS architecture and distributed location-aided transmission scheme to enhance reflected gain for CSI-limited RIS-assisted near-field communications, addressing channel estimation difficulties and discrete phase shift constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the double-fading attenuation of passive RIS and address the neglected challenges of channel estimation difficulty and discrete phase shift constraints in practical RIS deployment, while enabling zero-power operation through power harvesting.

Method: Designs a new element-wise RIS architecture with dynamic element selection capability, uses Fresnel diffraction theory to map spatial locations to phase distributions, and proposes distributed beamforming with determine-then-align phase design that eliminates RIS-associated channel estimation requirements at BS.

Result: The asymptotic analysis shows the proposed scheme achieves optimal gain with a fixed proportion of reflective elements when RIS is large, and simulations verify its superiority over other protocols.

Conclusion: The proposed element-wise RIS architecture and distributed location-aided transmission scheme effectively enhance reflected gain for near-field communications while reducing estimation overhead and addressing practical deployment constraints.

Abstract: Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) emerges as an effective
technique to resist the double-fading attenuation of passive RIS. By embedding
with power harvesting function, it further evolves to zero-power active RIS,
which can effectively enhance the flexibility of RIS deployment without
external power demand. Nevertheless, existing works neglected the inherent
difficulty of channel estimation (CE) for RIS-assisted systems, and the
discrete phase shift constraint in practical deployment. In this paper we
design a new element-wise RIS architecture and propose a distributed
location-aided transmission scheme with low complexity to enhance the reflected
gain for channel state information (CSI)-limited RIS-assisted near-field
communications. Specifically, the new element-wise RIS provides dynamic element
selection capability with low hardware resources. Based on Fresnel diffraction
theory, we construct the mapping from locations in space-domain to phase
distributions of waves in phase-domain and reveal the priority of elements for
harvesting and reflecting. {Then, the distributed beamforming design with the
phase of determine-then-align is proposed, where the estimation overhead
reduction stems from exempted requirements of RIS-associated CE at base station
(BS).} The asymptotic analysis indicates that the proposed scheme can achieve
the optimal gain with a fixed proportion of reflective elements when RIS is
large, followed by simulations to verify its superiority to other protocols.

latency, energy efficiency, and computational resources, particularly in
multi-user interactive scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce the
concept of spatial computing communications (SCC), a framework designed to meet
the latency and energy demands of multi-user VR over distributed mobile edge
computing (MEC) networks. SCC jointly represents the physical space, defined by
users and base stations, and the virtual space, representing shared immersive
environments, using a probabilistic model of user dynamics and resource
requirements. The resource deployment task is then formulated as a
multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem that simultaneously
minimizes system latency and energy consumption across distributed MEC
resources. To solve this problem, we propose MO-CMPO, a multi-objective
consistency model with policy optimization that integrates supervised learning
and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by preference weights.
Leveraging a sparse graph neural network (GNN), MO-CMPO efficiently generates
Pareto-optimal solutions. Simulations with real-world New Radio base station
datasets demonstrate that MO-CMPO achieves superior hypervolume performance and
significantly lower inference latency than baseline methods. Furthermore, the
analysis reveals practical deployment patterns: latency-oriented solutions
favor local MEC execution to reduce transmission delay, while energy-oriented
solutions minimize redundant placements to save energy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a simple and scalable modulation scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces that avoids complex beamforming while maintaining good performance.

Method: Partition N-element RIS into disjoint groups, each using predetermined binary reflection patterns to create distinct channel signatures at the receiver. Information is embedded in signature indices.

Result: Achieves diversity order equal to receiver antennas (n_R) and coding gain proportional to RIS elements (N). Spatial correlation among RIS elements improves performance at low spectral efficiency.

Conclusion: RIS-CSM provides a practical, lightweight modulation approach with simple channel estimation, scalable spectral efficiency, and validated theoretical performance under Rayleigh fading.

Abstract: This work proposes RIS-enabled channel signature modulation (RIS-CSM), a
lightweight index modulation scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RIS). An N-element RIS is partitioned into disjoint groups, each employing
predetermined binary reflection patterns to generate distinct channel
signatures at an $n_R$-antenna receiver, without RIS-side beamforming.
Information is embedded in the indices of these signatures, enabling simple
channel estimation and scalable spectral efficiency. A closed-form upper bound
on error probability and capacity analysis are derived, revealing diversity
order $n_R$ and coding gain proportional to N. Simulation results under
Rayleigh fading validate the theoretical analysis. Moreover, simulations
indicate that spatial correlation among RIS elements can improve system
performance at low spectral efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies focused on total number of inequivalent codes with fixed length, but the case where dimension varies with length had not been considered.

Method: Derived explicit asymptotic formulas for equivalence classes under three standard notions of equivalence, with fixed alphabet size and increasing length.

Result: Obtained asymptotic formulas for code equivalence classes and an exact asymptotic expression for the sum of all q-binomial coefficients, answering an open question.

Conclusion: Established connection between asymptotic quantities and discrete Gaussian distributions from Brownian motion, providing probabilistic interpretation of results.

Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic number of equivalence classes of linear codes
with prescribed length and dimension. While the total number of inequivalent
codes of a given length has been studied previously, the case where the
dimension varies as a function of the length has not yet been considered. We
derive explicit asymptotic formulas for the number of equivalence classes under
three standard notions of equivalence, for a fixed alphabet size and increasing
length. Our approach also yields an exact asymptotic expression for the sum of
all q-binomial coefficients, which is of independent interest and answers an
open question in this context. Finally, we establish a natural connection
between these asymptotic quantities and certain discrete Gaussian distributions
arising from Brownian motion, providing a probabilistic interpretation of our
results.

### [268] [Rotatable Antenna-Enhanced Beamforming: Signal Enhancement and Interference Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14574)
*Jie Feng,Zhenbing Liu,Junjie Dai,Hongbin Chen,Fangjiong Chen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper proposes rotatable antenna (RA) beamforming that jointly optimizes antenna rotation and beamforming weights to maximize array gain while suppressing interference, outperforming traditional fixed-orientation antenna approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional beamforming with fixed-orientation antenna arrays has limitations in enhancing signals and suppressing interference due to varying antenna directive gains at different steering angles.

Method: Joint optimization of antenna rotation vector (ARV) and antenna weight vector (AWV) using alternating optimization algorithm for multi-beam forming, with closed-form optimal solution for single-beam forming without interference.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed RA-based scheme significantly outperforms traditional fixed-orientation antenna and isotropic antenna schemes in terms of array gain.

Conclusion: Rotatable antennas provide new spatial degrees of freedom that enable superior beamforming performance compared to conventional approaches.

Abstract: Conventional beamforming with fixed-orientation antenna (FOA) arrays may
struggle to effectively enhance signal and/or suppress interference due to
significant variations in antenna directive gains over different steering
angles. To break this limitation, we investigate in this paper the rotatable
antenna (RA)-enhanced single/multi-beam forming by exploiting the new spatial
degrees of freedom (DoFs) via antennas' rotation optimization. Specifically,
the antenna rotation vector (ARV) and antenna weight vector (AWV) are jointly
optimized to maximize the minimum array gain over signal directions, subject to
a given constraint on the maximum array gain over interference directions. For
the special case of single-beam forming without interference, the optimal ARV
is derived in closed-form with the maximum ratio combining (MRC) beamformer
applied to the AWV. For the general case of multi-beam forming, we propose an
efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to find a high-quality
suboptimal solution by iteratively optimizing one of the ARV and AWV with the
other being fixed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RA-based
scheme can significantly outperform the traditional FOA-based and isotropic
antenna (IA)-based schemes in terms of array gain.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposed task-based quantization channel estimation for RIS-empowered mmWave systems with low-resolution ADCs, achieving near-unlimited resolution performance with small training overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High cost and power consumption of ADCs in large antenna arrays for mmWave systems makes low-resolution ADCs beneficial, requiring efficient channel estimation under finite bit-resolution constraints.

Method: Developed two channel estimators: cascaded channel estimator for passive RIS elements, and separate channel estimator leveraging semi-passive RIS elements with RF chains, using task-based quantization considering hybrid analog-digital architecture.

Result: Proposed designs outperform purely digital methods and approach unlimited resolution ADC performance, showing superiority over baselines with small training overhead.

Conclusion: Task-based quantization effectively addresses channel estimation challenges in low-resolution ADC mmWave RIS systems, enabling near-optimal performance with practical hardware constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate channel estimation for reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) empowered millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user
single-input multiple-output communication systems using low-resolution
quantization. Due to the high cost and power consumption of analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs) in large antenna arrays and for wide signal bandwidths,
designing mmWave systems with low-resolution ADCs is beneficial. To tackle this
issue, we propose a channel estimation design using task-based quantization
that considers the underlying hybrid analog and digital architecture in order
to improve the system performance under finite bit-resolution constraints. Our
goal is to accomplish a channel estimation task that minimizes the mean squared
error distortion between the true and estimated channel. We develop two types
of channel estimators: a cascaded channel estimator for an RIS with purely
passive elements, and an estimator for the separate RIS-related channels that
leverages additional information from a few semi-passive elements at the RIS
capable of processing the received signals with radio frequency chains.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimation designs
exploiting task-based quantization outperform purely digital methods and can
effectively approach the performance of a system with unlimited resolution
ADCs. Furthermore, the proposed channel estimators are shown to be superior to
baselines with small training overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop rate-adaptive coding schemes that can approach the Shannon capacity limit over the entire rate range [0,1] for binary-input AWGN channels.

Method: Using density evolution analysis on protograph spatially coupled LDPC codes as inner codes in MacKay-Neal ensembles, with a parallel channel model for threshold computation.

Result: The spatially coupled MN code ensembles can perform within 0.15 dB from the binary-input AWGN capacity across the full [0,1] rate range.

Conclusion: Spatially coupled MacKay-Neal code ensembles provide an effective approach for achieving near-capacity performance in rate-adaptive coding systems.

Abstract: We analyze by density evolution the asymptotic performance of rate-adaptive
MacKay-Neal (MN) code ensembles, where the inner code is a protograph spatially
coupled (SC) low-density parity-check code. By resorting to a suitably-defined

TL;DR: Analysis of rate-adaptive MacKay-Neal codes using protographs with outer distribution matcher for rate adaptation and inner LDPC code, achieving near-Shannon limit performance across wide rate range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop rate-adaptive coding schemes that can operate near Shannon limit across wide rate ranges with constant blocklength, suitable for high-throughput wireless/optical links with binary-input modulations.

Method: Combines outer distribution matcher for rate adaptation with inner protograph-based LDPC code, analyzed through equivalent communication model, density evolution, and error floor analysis using input-output weight distribution.

Result: Demonstrates operation within 1 dB from Shannon limit over wide code rate range using single LDPC code ensemble, with rate selection via DM parameter tuning.

Conclusion: The construction provides appealing rate-flexible solution for high-throughput wireless/optical links with constant blocklength and fixed inner LDPC code.

Abstract: Rate-adaptive MacKay-Neal (MN) codes based on protographs are analyzed. The
code construction employs an outer distribution matcher (DM) to adapt the rate
of the scheme. The DM is coupled with an inner protograph-based low-density
parity-check (LDPC) code. The performance achievable by the resulting code
structure, that is nonlinear, is studied by means of an equivalent
communication model that reduces the problem to the analysis of the inner
(linear) LDPC code with transmission that takes place in parallel over the
communication channel, and over a suitably defined binary symmetric channel. A
density evolution analysis of protograph MN code ensembles is outlined, and it
is complemented by an error floor analysis that relies on the derivation of the
average input-output weight distribution of the inner LDPC code ensemble.
Conditions on the shape of the normalized logarithmic asymptotic input-output
weight distribution are defined, which allow discarding code ensembles with bad
error floor properties during the code design phase. Examples of code designs
are provided, showing how the use of a single LDPC code ensemble allows
operating within 1 dB from the Shannon limit over a wide range of code rates,
where the code rate is selected by tuning the DM parameters. By enabling rate
flexibility with a constant blocklength, and with a fixed LDPC code as inner
code, the construction provides an appealing solution for very high-throughput
wireless (optical) links that employ binary-input modulations.

TL;DR: PID violates the set-theoretic principle that the whole equals the sum of its parts (WESP) in multivariate systems, leading to fundamental limitations in current lattice-based frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address conceptual and technical challenges in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), particularly the violation of the set-theoretic principle that the whole equals the sum of its parts, which limits its applicability in analyzing fine-grained interactions between multiple random variables.

Method: Introduce a new axiomatic framework called System Information Decomposition (SID) specifically for three-variable systems, which redefines summation rules of decomposed information atoms based on synergistic relationships to resolve WESP violations.

Result: SID successfully resolves WESP violations in three-variable systems, but for systems with four or more variables, no partial summation approach within existing lattice-based structures can fully eliminate WESP inconsistencies.

Conclusion: The results highlight the inherent inadequacy of (antichain) lattice-based decompositions for general multivariate systems, revealing fundamental limitations in current PID frameworks.

Abstract: Partial Information Decomposition (PID) was proposed by Williams and Beer in
2010 as a tool for analyzing fine-grained interactions between multiple random
variables, and has since found numerous applications ranging from neuroscience
to privacy. However, a unified theoretical framework remains elusive due to key
conceptual and technical challenges. We identify and illustrate a crucial
problem: PID violates the set-theoretic principle that the whole equals the sum
of its parts (WESP). Through a counterexample in a three-variable system, we
demonstrate how such violations naturally arise, revealing a fundamental
limitation of current lattice-based PID frameworks. To address this issue, we
introduce a new axiomatic framework, termed System Information Decomposition
(SID), specifically tailored for three-variable systems. SID resolves the WESP
violation by redefining the summation rules of decomposed information atoms
based on synergistic relationships. However, we further show that for systems
with four or more variables, no partial summation approach within the existing
lattice-based structures can fully eliminate WESP inconsistencies. Our results
thus highlight the inherent inadequacy of (antichain) lattice-based
decompositions for general multivariate systems.

Motivation: To overcome limitations of conventional fixed antenna systems by introducing flexible antenna architectures that can dynamically create, reposition, or deactivate radiation sites for user-centric and dynamic coverage.

Method: Introduces generalized pinching-antenna systems implemented through various media including dielectric waveguides, leaky coaxial cables, and surface-wave guiding structures, using mechanical, electronic, or hybrid activation mechanisms.

Result: The paper describes physical mechanisms, wireless channel models, and system architectures ranging from single- to multiple-waveguide configurations, highlighting unique propagation and reconfigurability characteristics compared to conventional antennas.

Conclusion: Identifies key research challenges and outlines future directions for practical deployment of generalized pinching antennas in next-generation wireless networks, emphasizing their potential for synergistic integration with emerging wireless technologies.

Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems have emerged as a novel and transformative
flexible-antenna architecture for next-generation wireless networks. They offer
unprecedented flexibility and spatial reconfigurability by enabling dynamic
positioning and activation of radiating elements along a signal-guiding medium
(e.g., dielectric waveguides), which is not possible with conventional fixed
antenna systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of generalized
pinching antenna systems, which retain the core principle of creating localized
radiation points on demand, but can be physically realized in a variety of
settings. These include implementations based on dielectric waveguides, leaky
coaxial cables, surface-wave guiding structures, and other types of media,
employing different feeding methods and activation mechanisms (e.g.,
mechanical, electronic, or hybrid). Despite differences in their physical
realizations, they all share the same inherent ability to form, reposition, or
deactivate radiation sites as needed, enabling user-centric and dynamic
coverage. We first describe the underlying physical mechanisms of
representative generalized pinching-antenna realizations and their associated
wireless channel models, highlighting their unique propagation and
reconfigurability characteristics compared with conventional antennas. Then, we
review several representative pinching-antenna system architectures, ranging
from single- to multiple-waveguide configurations, and discuss advanced design
strategies tailored to these flexible deployments. Furthermore, we examine
their integration with emerging wireless technologies to enable synergistic,
user-centric solutions. Finally, we identify key open research challenges and
outline future directions, charting a pathway toward the practical deployment
of generalized pinching antennas in next-generation wireless networks.

Result: Numerical results show the proposed approach achieves high-accuracy device activity detection, channel estimation, and target localization simultaneously.

Conclusion: The study validates the feasibility of embedding localization functionality into massive communication systems for future 6G networks.

Abstract: This paper presents an initial investigation into the combination of
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and massive communication, both of
which are largely regarded as key scenarios in sixth-generation (6G) wireless
networks. Specifically, we consider a cell-free network comprising a large
number of users, multiple targets, and distributed base stations (BSs). In each
time slot, a random subset of users becomes active, transmitting pilot signals
that can be scattered by the targets before reaching the BSs. Unlike
conventional massive random access schemes, where the primary objectives are
device activity detection and channel estimation, our framework also enables
target localization by leveraging the multipath propagation effects introduced
by the targets. However, due to the intricate dependency between user channels
and target locations, characterizing the posterior distribution required for
minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation presents significant computational
challenges. To handle this problem, we propose a hybrid message passing-based
framework that incorporates multiple approximations to mitigate computational
complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves
high-accuracy device activity detection, channel estimation, and target
localization simultaneously, validating the feasibility of embedding
localization functionality into massive communication systems for future 6G

Conclusion: The ERA-ISAC system effectively enhances system DoFs and overall performance through dynamic radiation pattern adjustment, demonstrating substantial improvements over traditional approaches.

Abstract: Beamforming with a sufficient number of antennas is one of the most

we design a tri-hybrid beamforming optimization framework combining digital,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between theoretical analyses of fluid antennas (which assume near-instant reconfiguration, perfect channel knowledge, etc.) and practical realities that limit their performance in real-world applications.

Method: The authors dissect common assumptions, contrast them with practical constraints, use illustrative examples and simulations to demonstrate performance gaps, and propose modeling refinements, experimental validation methods, and improved control algorithms.

Result: Demonstrates that ignoring practical factors leads to overestimated performance gains in capacity and coverage, and shows that realistic constraints significantly impact achievable benefits from fluid antennas.

Conclusion: While fluid antennas remain promising for B5G/6G and IoT applications, their full potential can only be realized by incorporating practical considerations into system design and performance evaluation.

Abstract: Fluid antennas, including those based on liquid, mechanical, and pixel-based
technologies, are poised to significantly enhance next-generation wireless
systems by adaptively optimizing their radiation characteristics. Many
theoretical analyses assumed near-instant reconfiguration, perfect channel
knowledge, static or slowly varying propagation environments, and ideal
material properties that rarely hold in practice. In this article, we dissect
these common assumptions and contrast them with the realities of finite
actuation time, limited and imperfect channel state information, rapidly
changing fading conditions, electromagnetic coupling, and mechanical
constraints. Through illustrative examples and simulations, we demonstrate how
ignoring these factors can lead to overestimated gains in capacity, coverage,
etc.. We then propose modeling refinements, experimental validation methods,
and emerging control algorithms that better account for real-world constraints.
Our findings highlight that, while reconfigurable antennas remain highly
promising for B5G/6G and Internet of things (IoT) applications, their full
potential can only be realized by incorporating practical considerations into

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MVDR beamforming is computationally expensive for large arrays (cubic complexity with antenna elements), making it impractical for real-time applications with massive arrays.

Method: Leverages Sherman-Morrison formula, low-rank SVD approximations, and algebraic manipulation specifically for scenarios where signals of interest are below noise floor.

Result: Achieves linear computational complexity instead of cubic, significantly reduces computational load while maintaining high beamforming accuracy for large-scale arrays.

Conclusion: Enables practical real-time MVDR beamforming applications in radar, sonar, and wireless communications with massive antenna arrays.

Abstract: The Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamforming technique is
widely applied in array systems to mitigate interference. However, applying
MVDR to large arrays is computationally challenging; its computational
complexity scales cubically with the number of antenna elements. In this paper,
we introduce a scalable MVDR beamforming method tailored for massive arrays.
Our approach, which is specific to scenarios where the signal of interest is
below the noise floor (e.g.,~GPS), leverages the Sherman-Morrison formula,
low-rank Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) approximations, and algebraic
manipulation. Using our approach, we reduce the computational complexity from
cubic to linear in the number of antennas. We evaluate the proposed method
through simulations, comparing its computational efficiency and beamforming
accuracy with the conventional MVDR approach. Our method significantly reduces
the computational load while maintaining high beamforming accuracy for
large-scale arrays. This solution holds promise for real-time applications of
MVDR beamforming in fields like radar, sonar, and wireless communications,

Result: CRLB analysis and simulation demonstrate reliable estimation even when the signal is over a thousand times weaker than the interference. A low-altitude radio-map case study verifies practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework enables reliable estimation of weak target signals overwhelmed by strong interference, advancing complete wireless environment awareness for future intelligent networks.

Abstract: Complete awareness of the wireless environment, crucial for future
intelligent networks, requires sensing all transmitted signals, not just the
strongest. A fundamental barrier is estimating the target signal when it is
buried under strong co-channel interference from other transmitters, a failure
of which renders the signal unusable. This work proposes a maximum likelihood
(ML)-based cross-preamble estimation framework that exploits carrier frequency
offset (CFO) constancy across beam-swept synchronization signals (SS),
coherently aggregating information across multiple observations to reinforce
the desired signal against overwhelming interference. Cramer-Rao lower bound
(CRLB) analysis and simulation demonstrate reliable estimation even when the
signal is over a thousand times weaker than the interference. A low-altitude
radio-map case study further verifies the framework's practical effectiveness.

Motivation: ISI channels cause time dispersion and noise coloring through equalization, requiring effective decoding methods for colored noise without interleaving.

Method: Proposed ORBGRAND-AI decoder inspired by approximate independence in statistical physics, tested on delay tap models including two-tap dicode and RFView-derived ISI channels under imperfect CSI.

Result: ORBGRAND-AI delivers same or lower BLER than CA-SCL with interleaving for same energy per bit, and second order autoregressive model adequately represents RFView channel effects.

Conclusion: ORBGRAND-AI is an effective decoder for colored noise in ISI channels that can match or outperform state-of-the-art soft input decoders without requiring interleaving.

Abstract: Inter symbol interference (ISI), which occurs in a wide variety of channels,
is a result of time dispersion. It can be mitigated by equalization which
results in noise coloring. For such colored noise, we propose a decoder called
Ordered Reliability Bit Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (ORBGRANDAI)
which is inspired by the development of approximate independence in statistical
physics. By foregoing interleaving, ORBGRAND-AI can deliver the same, or lower,
block error rate (BLER) for the same amount of energy per information bit in an
ISI channel as a state-of-the-art soft input decoder, such as Cyclic Redundancy
Check Assisted-Successive Cancellation List (CA-SCL) decoding, with an
interleaver. To assess the decoding performance of ORBGRAND-AI, we consider
delay tap models and their associated colored noise. In particular, we examine
a two-tap dicode ISI channel as well as an ISI channel derived from data from
RFView, a physics-informed modeling and simulation tool. We investigate the
dicode and RFView channel under a variety of imperfect channel state
information assumptions and show that a second order autoregressive model
adequately represents the RFView channel effect.
