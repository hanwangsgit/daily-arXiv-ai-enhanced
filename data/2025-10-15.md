*Yumi Iwashita,Haakon Moe,Yang Cheng,Adnan Ansar,Georgios Georgakis,Adrian Stoica,Kazuto Nakashima,Ryo Kurazume,Jim Torresen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Method to improve 3D lunar maps from Kaguya TC images by reducing compression-induced noise in disparity maps, enhancing elevation accuracy for lunar missions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for high-quality 3D lunar maps for long-distance missions like NASA's Endurance, as Kaguya TC images suffer from altitude inaccuracies due to stereo matching errors and JPEG compression artifacts.

Method: Analyze compression behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, identify systematic disparity noise patterns in darker regions, and propose approach to reduce residual noise in disparity images from compressed images.

Result: Experimental results show the approach effectively reduces elevation noise, improving terrain data quality.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances safety and reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions by mitigating compression-induced noise in 3D lunar maps.

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

### [2] [Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835)
*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP's advantage over DINO in vision-language models stems from language supervision enabling better semantic understanding, not just larger training data, with CLIP excelling at text-intensive tasks while DINO performs slightly better on vision-centric ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether CLIP's superior performance in vision-language models comes from language supervision or larger training data, and to disentangle these factors through controlled experiments.

Method: Pre-trained CLIP and DINO under controlled settings with same architecture, dataset, and training configuration to achieve similar ImageNet accuracy, then analyzed embeddings and integrated them into VLMs for evaluation on 20 VQA benchmarks.

Result: CLIP captures high-level semantics (object categories, text) while DINO focuses on low-level features (colors, styles). CLIP excels at text-intensive VQA tasks, DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Language supervision variants provided limited gains.

Conclusion: Language supervision in CLIP enables better semantic understanding crucial for text-intensive vision-language tasks, providing scientific insights for vision encoder design in VLMs.

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited
data and domain specific biases. We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework
for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture
clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data
augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a
cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and
generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable,
annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve
diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoTPS-Net is a novel model for estimating 3D room layouts from single panorama images using CNN and Thin Plate Spline transformation, achieving high accuracy on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D room layout estimation is crucial for applications in robotics, augmented reality, and interior design.

Method: Two-stage architecture: CNN extracts features and learns TPS transformation parameters, then TPS layer warps reference layout to predicted layout using learned parameters.

Result: Achieved 3DIoU values of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and 91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets respectively, demonstrating robustness for both cuboid and non-cuboid layouts.

Conclusion: The model effectively combines TPS transformation with panorama images, showing high accuracy and generalization capability in room layout estimation.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,
respectively. The source code is available at:

*Yuehui Li,Yahao Lu,Haoyuan Wu,Sen Zhang,Liang Lin,Yukai Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Ivan-ISTD, a wavelet-guided framework for infrared small target detection that addresses cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise through two-stage wavelet alignment and real-domain noise invariance learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address dual challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in infrared small target detection for drone-based multi-modality sensing.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis for target domain alignment using multi-frequency wavelet filtering, 2) Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning with dynamic noise library and self-supervised loss.

Result: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics, demonstrates excellent robustness in cross-domain scenarios, and validated on Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark and other real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Ivan-ISTD effectively handles cross-domain challenges and noise perturbations in infrared small target detection, showing superior performance and robustness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spatial reasoning framework for warehouse environments that embeds bounding box coordinates into prompts to improve spatial understanding, achieving 4th place in the AI City Challenge with a score of 73.0606.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models struggle with spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments like warehouses due to scene clutter, occlusions, and lack of explicit spatial grounding.

Method: Embed mask dimensions (bounding box coordinates) into input prompts, fine-tune across four question categories with task-specific supervision, and append normalized answers to GPT responses for training consistency.

Result: Achieved a final score of 73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard of the Track 3 2025 AI City Challenge.

Conclusion: Structured prompt enrichment with geometric information and targeted optimization effectively advances spatial reasoning capabilities for real-world industrial environments.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

### [8] [AngularFuse: A Closer Look at Angle-based Perception for Spatial-Sensitive Multi-Modality Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12260)
*Xiaopeng Liu,Yupei Lin,Sen Zhang,Xiao Wang,Yukai Shi,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AngularFuse is a novel visible-infrared image fusion framework that uses cross-modal complementary masks, fine-grained reference image synthesis, and angle-aware loss to produce enhanced fused images with better details and balanced brightness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised fusion methods rely on manually designed loss functions that lack details, have uneven brightness, and focus only on gradient magnitude without considering direction, limiting practical application effectiveness.

Method: Proposes three key components: 1) Cross-modal complementary mask module to learn complementary information between modalities, 2) Fine-grained reference image synthesis combining Laplacian edge enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, 3) Angle-aware loss that constrains both gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on MSRS, RoadScene, and M3FD datasets show AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons confirm sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes.

Conclusion: AngularFuse demonstrates superior fusion capability by preserving both texture intensity and correct edge orientation, producing enhanced fused images that are better suited for downstream tasks like autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance.

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates Vision Transformer explainability methods (Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM) on medical imaging tasks, finding DINO with Grad-CAM provides the most faithful explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers have shown state-of-the-art performance in medical imaging but their complex attention mechanisms create explainability challenges that impact clinical trust and adoption.

Method: Evaluated different Vision Transformer architectures (ViT, DeiT, DINO, Swin Transformer) with Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM on peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image classification tasks using quantitative and qualitative analysis.

Result: DINO combined with Grad-CAM offered the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM consistently produced class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps, while Gradient Attention Rollout yielded more scattered activations. Even in misclassifications, DINO with Grad-CAM highlighted clinically relevant morphological features.

Conclusion: By improving model transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration of Vision Transformers into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

*Xinxin Huang,Han Sun,Junmin Cai,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APGNet is an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network for detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments, addressing image degradation and marine camouflage challenges through a Siamese architecture with prior-guided mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with underwater image degradation (low contrast, color distortion) and fail to adapt to marine camouflage due to lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.

Method: Uses MSRCR algorithm for data augmentation, Extended Receptive Field module with Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder, and adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary priors using spatial attention and deformable convolution.

Result: APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods on two public MAS datasets under widely used evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed APGNet effectively addresses underwater camouflaged object detection challenges by integrating adaptive prior guidance and multi-scale feature processing.

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

Method: Leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion representation from source videos, enabling generation of new videos that maintain original motion while allowing structural and semantic flexibility.

Result: Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate superiority over existing methods in maintaining motion consistency while enabling flexible structural and semantic changes.

Conclusion: VidMP3 successfully addresses key challenges in motion-preserved video editing and outperforms current approaches, with code to be made publicly available.

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync

animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift

preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art

### [15] [An Adaptive Edge-Guided Dual-Network Framework for Fast QR Code Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12098)
*Jianping Li,Dongyang Guo,Wenjie Li,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer) and Adaptive Dual-network (ADNet) for QR code deblurring, using explicit edge priors to improve decoding rates and dynamically selecting networks based on blur severity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for QR code deblurring don't exploit the highly structured patterns and sharp edges that characterize QR codes, which are crucial for successful decoding rather than just perceptual quality.

Method: Developed Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB) to embed explicit edge priors into Transformer architecture, created EG-Restormer for severe blur, LENet for mild blur, and integrated them into ADNet for adaptive network selection based on blur severity.

Result: EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve state-of-the-art performance with competitive speed, significantly boosting decoding rates for severely blurred QR codes while being efficient for mobile devices.

Conclusion: The proposed edge-guided approach and adaptive dual-network architecture effectively address QR code deblurring by leveraging structural priors and optimizing for decoding success rather than perceptual quality.

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

*Junfeng Ni,Yixin Chen,Zhifei Yang,Yu Liu,Ruijie Lu,Song-Chun Zhu,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve 3D scene reconstruction using generative diffusion models by leveraging accurate geometry guidance from planar structures to address limitations in reconstruction quality and multi-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using generative diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction struggle with poor reconstruction quality due to lack of geometric supervision and multi-view inconsistencies, leading to shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded geometry.

Method: The method leverages planar structures to derive accurate metric-scale depth maps, then incorporates this geometry guidance throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with video diffusion models.

Result: Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show consistent outperformance of existing baselines in both geometry and appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. The method also supports single-view inputs and unposed videos with strong generalizability across indoor and outdoor scenarios.

Conclusion: Accurate geometry is identified as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction, and the proposed method successfully addresses key limitations through geometry-guided generative completion.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

### [17] [DRL: Discriminative Representation Learning with Parallel Adapters for Class Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12107)
*Jiawei Zhan,Jun Liu,Jinlong Peng,Xiaochen Chen,Bin-Bin Gao,Yong Liu,Chengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework with Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA) network and Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS) to address three key challenges in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning: large model complexity, non-smooth representation shifts, and inconsistency between stage-wise optimization and global inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome three major challenges in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation shift during incremental learning, and inconsistency between stage-wise sub-problem optimization and global inference.

Method: Proposes DRL framework with IPA network that learns lightweight adapters in each incremental stage, connected in parallel via transfer gates to inherit representation capability. Uses DAS to decouple positive and negative sample constraints by comparing them with virtual anchors, promoting discriminative representation learning and feature space alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show that DRL consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference phases.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL framework effectively addresses key challenges in non-rehearsal CIL by enabling smooth representation shifts through parallel adapters and aligning feature spaces across stages via decoupled anchor supervision, achieving superior performance with high efficiency.

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

### [18] [Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion Model for Old-Photo Face Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12114)
*Wenjie Li,Xiangyi Wang,Heng Guo,Guangwei Gao,Zhanyu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSDiff is a self-supervised selective-guided diffusion method for old-photo face restoration that uses pseudo-reference faces and staged supervision to address localized artifacts while preserving identity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-guided methods struggle with localized artifacts and face color issues in old-photo restoration, relying on explicit degradation priors or global statistical guidance that are insufficient for complex real-world degradations.

Method: Leverages pseudo-reference faces from pre-trained diffusion models under weak guidance, uses face parsing maps and scratch masks for selective restoration, and applies staged supervision with structural guidance throughout denoising and color refinement in later steps.

Result: Outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual quality, fidelity, and regional controllability on the VintageFace benchmark of 300 real old photos with varying degradation levels.

Conclusion: SSDiff effectively addresses compound degradations in old photos through selective guidance and staged supervision, achieving superior restoration quality while maintaining identity preservation.

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

*Ziyuan Luo,Yangyi Zhao,Ka Chun Cheung,Simon See,Renjie Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageSentinel is a framework that protects visual datasets from unauthorized use in Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) systems by generating sentinel images with embedded character sequences as retrieval keys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting private image datasets from unauthorized use in RAIG systems is challenging because traditional watermarking methods fail due to complex feature extraction and recombination processes that don't preserve watermarks.

Method: Leverages vision-language models to synthesize sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with original datasets, embedding randomly generated character sequences as retrieval keys for protection verification.

Result: Experimental results show ImageSentinel effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation quality for authorized applications.

Conclusion: ImageSentinel provides an effective solution for dataset protection in RAIG systems by using synthesized sentinel images with embedded retrieval keys, addressing the limitations of traditional watermarking approaches.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

*David Parra,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Trevor Seets,Andreas Velten*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a constrained optimization approach using gradient descent to design practical coding functions for compressive single-photon 3D imaging that work within hardware limitations like bandwidth and peak power constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-photon cameras face performance limitations due to hardware constraints (system bandwidth, laser power, data rates, memory). Existing compressive histograms underperform under real-world illumination hardware constraints.

Method: A constrained optimization approach using gradient descent to jointly optimize illumination and coding matrix (coding functions) that adhere to hardware constraints like bandwidth and peak power limits.

Result: The optimized coding functions consistently outperform traditional designs under both bandwidth and peak power constraints, with particular advantage in peak-power-constrained systems. The approach also adapts to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses.

Conclusion: The proposed constrained optimization method enables practical coding function design for compressive single-photon 3D imaging that works effectively within real-world hardware limitations.

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between current open-source models and commercial ones in generalist visual captioning, which limits applications like data synthesis.

Method: Proposes CapFlow - a multi-agent collaboration workflow that leverages open-source models to generate high-quality captions, then uses this as data synthesizer to fine-tune MetaCaptioner.

Result: CapFlow achieves caption quality comparable to GPT-4 across various domains with 89.5% cost reduction. MetaCaptioner achieves commercial-level captioning capabilities and top-tier multimodal performance in open-source community.

Conclusion: CapFlow and MetaCaptioner provide a strong, cost-effective visual captioning solution that can benefit future multimodal research.

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

TL;DR: FedHUG is a federated learning framework for remote physiological measurement that addresses privacy concerns and label scarcity by enabling unsupervised domain generalization across heterogeneous client data without requiring labeled client data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote physiological measurement requires collecting privacy-sensitive user data, and existing methods rely on labeled client data, making it challenging to update deployed models with unlabeled user data.

Method: FedHUG framework includes: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module that dynamically adjusts aggregation weights based on bias evaluation for heterogeneous non-IID data, and (2) Global Distribution-aware Learning Controller that parameterizes label distribution and manipulates client training strategies to handle server-client label skew and long-tail issues.

Result: The framework shows superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques for physiological estimation using either RGB video or mmWave radar data.

Conclusion: FedHUG successfully addresses privacy and label scarcity challenges in remote physiological measurement through federated unsupervised domain generalization, enabling effective model updates with unlabeled heterogeneous client data.

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

*Jiahuan Zhou,Chao Zhu,Zhenyu Cui,Zichen Liu,Xu Zou,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KFF method for continual test-time adaptation uses class-aware domain knowledge fusion and fission to dynamically accumulate discriminative historical knowledge while avoiding negative knowledge interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTTA methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting of historical knowledge and insufficient learning of new knowledge due to irregular domain switching, leading to performance degradation.

Method: Proposes KFF with two modules: 1) Domain Knowledge Fission (KFI) to separate new domain knowledge from class-aware prompt pool, and 2) Domain Knowledge Fusion (KFU) to merge new knowledge efficiently using greedy dynamic merging strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet-C dataset show effectiveness against other methods.

Conclusion: KFF successfully addresses catastrophic forgetting and insufficient learning in CTTA by adaptively managing domain knowledge through fusion and fission mechanisms.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

*Ziyuan Gao,Philippe Morel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPL introduces diffusion-based prototype learning for one-shot medical image segmentation, modeling prototypes as probability distributions to generate diverse variants from limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prototype methods fail to capture intra-class diversity due to deterministic averaging, leading to brittle representations that don't generalize well across anatomical variability in medical images.

Method: Uses diffusion processes to transform single prototypes into diverse variant sets, with spatial-aware conditioning and conservative fusion to preserve fidelity while maximizing diversity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on abdominal MRI and CT datasets for one-shot medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: DPL effectively addresses the limitations of traditional prototype methods by modeling prototypes as distributions, enabling robust generalization from minimal labeled data.

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

*Jiahuan Zhou,Kai Zhu,Zhenyu Cui,Zichen Liu,Xu Zou,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes State Space Prompting (SSP) for video understanding, which uses intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to better capture spatiotemporal information in videos, improving performance while reducing fine-tuning parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pre-trained state space models for video classification fail to effectively capture spatial and temporal contextual information when using prompt learning for downstream task adaptation, limiting their ability to extract discriminative information.

Method: Proposed SSP method with two modules: Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) to aggregate spatial key information within frames, and Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) to spread discriminative spatiotemporal information across frames, adaptively balancing and compressing key information.

Result: Extensive experiments on four video benchmark datasets show SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by 2.76% on average while reducing fine-tuning parameter overhead.

Conclusion: SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in videos through complementary intra-frame and inter-frame prompting, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters.

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Motivation: To achieve high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction with geometric accuracy and computational efficiency, addressing limitations in existing methods.

Method: Uses CUDA-accelerated rasterization pipeline with redesigned depth rendering via differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection, analytic gradient formulation for surface normals, and learnable attribute for differentiable Gaussian pruning.

Result: State-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy across all modalities (RGB, depth, surface normals, semantics) with improved geometric consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry-aware paradigm effectively enables high-quality multimodal 3D reconstruction with computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and
differentiable framework for high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction based
on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEEP3D is a box-supervised end-to-end 3D instance segmentation method that uses a student-teacher framework with pseudo-mask generation, eliminating the need for two-stage training while achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the high annotation costs of fully supervised 3D instance segmentation methods while overcoming the ambiguity challenges of box-level supervision and the complexity of existing two-stage approaches.

Method: Uses a student-teacher framework with Exponential Moving Average updates, instance center-based query refinement for better localization, and two novel losses (query consistency and masked feature consistency) to align predictions with pseudo-masks.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets while remaining computationally efficient.

Conclusion: BEEP3D provides an effective end-to-end solution for box-supervised 3D instance segmentation that eliminates the need for complex two-stage pipelines while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompoDistill is a knowledge distillation framework that addresses visual attention misalignment between teacher and student MLLMs to improve visual perception abilities in smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge distillation methods struggle to effectively transfer rich visual perception abilities from larger teacher MLLMs to smaller student models, particularly due to visual attention misalignment issues.

Method: Proposed CompoDistill framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with the teacher's visual attention to enhance visual perception capabilities.

Result: Significantly improved performance on compositional reasoning tasks requiring visual perception abilities while maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks. Also demonstrated effectiveness with more advanced backbones.

Conclusion: CompoDistill effectively addresses visual attention misalignment in knowledge distillation for MLLMs, enhancing visual perception abilities in smaller models and showing good generalizability.

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving models struggle with out-of-distribution scenarios despite training on diverse datasets. The COOOL benchmark addresses this gap by focusing on hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies.

Method: Hierarchical reasoning framework integrating frame-level captioning, incident frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models, enhanced by model ensembling and Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol.

Result: Ranked 2nd among 29 teams on the official 2COOOL open leaderboard and achieved the best CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives.

Conclusion: Hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction for accident analysis and broader understanding of safety-critical traffic events.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

*Muammer Bay,Timo von Marcard,Dren Fazlija*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates using synthetic data from NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator for fine-tuning object detection models in warehouse logistics, comparing performance against real-world data only training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many AI applications face limitations due to lack of expertise and resources, forcing reliance on general-purpose models that require costly domain-specific data for fine-tuning. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative to real-world data collection.

Method: Used NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator tool to generate synthetic data for pallet detection in warehouse settings. Conducted experiments comparing models trained on real data only versus various synthetic dataset generation strategies.

Result: The study found that synthetic data can effectively improve object detection model performance. A balanced integration of synthetic and real data leads to robust and efficient models.

Conclusion: Synthetic image data provides valuable practical applications in computer vision, particularly for warehouse logistics, where combining synthetic and real data can create effective object detection systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

*Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Luu Tu Nguyen,Thi Bich Phuong Man,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIANet: A dual-stream CNN framework using phase-aware dynamic images for micro-expression recognition, outperforming single-phase approaches on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expression recognition is challenging due to subtle facial cues and limited data. Existing dynamic image methods overlook distinct temporal phase characteristics within micro-expressions.

Method: Proposes DIANet with two streams: one for onset-to-apex phase and another for apex-to-offset phase, processed by dedicated CNNs and fused using cross-attention module.

Result: Outperforms conventional single-phase DI-based methods on CASME-II, SAMM, and MMEW datasets, demonstrating consistent performance improvements.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of temporal phase information is crucial for micro-expression recognition and represents a promising direction for advancing the field.

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

*Hritik Bansal,Devandra Singh Sachan,Kai-Wei Chang,Aditya Grover,Gargi Ghosh,Wen-tau Yih,Ramakanth Pasunuru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes data curation strategies for vision-language reasoning datasets and introduces HoneyBee, a large-scale chain-of-thought dataset that improves VLM performance across model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The principles underlying effective vision-language reasoning training datasets are poorly understood, despite recent advances in VLMs. The authors aim to systematically study data curation approaches to improve VL reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors analyze context source strategies, implement targeted data interventions (auxiliary signals from captions, text-only reasoning), and explore scaling across data dimensions (images, questions, CoT solutions). They introduce HoneyBee dataset with 2.5M examples and propose test-time scaling strategy.

Result: HoneyBee-trained VLMs outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes. A 3B parameter model outperforms SOTA by 7.8% and base model by 24.8% on MathVerse. Test-time scaling reduces decoding cost by 73% without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The work presents improved strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation, demonstrating that context source strategies, targeted interventions, and multi-dimensional scaling significantly enhance reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

*Victor Besnier,David Hurych,Andrei Bursuc,Eduardo Valle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a self-correcting image generation method that iteratively refines sampled tokens to address structural inconsistencies in parallel token prediction, maintaining efficiency while improving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving inference efficiency in generative models is crucial for commercial viability and scientific progress. Parallel token prediction reduces inference time but introduces structural inconsistencies due to token incompatibilities and lack of backtracking mechanisms.

Method: Uses iterative token refinement with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in context to improve robustness and enable token fixing during sampling, preserving parallel prediction efficiency.

Result: Demonstrated substantial improvements in generation quality on ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 for images, and UCF-101 and NuScenes for videos, across both modalities.

Conclusion: The method successfully combines the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction with enhanced generation quality through iterative self-correction, addressing key limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

### [34] [Vectorized Video Representation with Easy Editing via Hierarchical Spatio-Temporally Consistent Proxy Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12256)
*Ye Chen,Liming Tan,Yupeng Zhu,Yuanbin Wang,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent dynamic objects in videos, overcoming limitations of pixel-level tracking methods that are vulnerable to tracking errors, occlusions, and large motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video representations rely on unstable pixel-level matching and tracking, which are vulnerable to tracking errors (even a few pixels), occlusions, and large motions, leading to collapse of visual object representations.

Method: Uses hierarchical proxy nodes to represent dynamically changing objects/scenes, with dynamic representation update mechanism leveraging spatio-temporal priors. Features decoupled encoding of shape and texture representations across different visual objects.

Result: Achieves high video reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video processing tasks including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally consistent video editing.

Conclusion: The proposed proxy node representation provides stable multi-scale object representation unaffected by tracking errors, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation, while enabling controllable appearance editing.

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

*Yuto Yokoi,Kazuhiro Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed two novel loss functions - Multiplicative Loss and Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss - for medical image segmentation that outperform traditional additive combinations of Cross Entropy and Dice Loss, especially under data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images suffer from data scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust training objectives. Traditional additive combinations of Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are sensitive to hyperparameters and perform suboptimally with limited data.

Method: Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy and Dice losses multiplicatively to dynamically modulate gradients based on prediction confidence. Confidence-Adaptive version applies confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.

Result: Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation benchmarks show the framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and existing loss functions.

Conclusion: The proposed loss functions offer a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

*Jinlun Ye,Zhuohao Sun,Yiqiao Qiu,Qiu Li,Zhijun Tan,Ruixuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel OOD detection method that uses local background features from ID images as fake OOD features during training to reduce model overconfidence on OOD data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of neural networks producing overconfident predictions on OOD data without requiring expensive auxiliary OOD datasets or fake image generation.

Method: Extracts background features from in-distribution (ID) images as simulated OOD representations using local convolution invariance, then optimizes networks to reduce L2-norm of these background features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple OOD detection benchmarks and shows wide compatibility with existing post-hoc methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively alleviates overconfidence on OOD data using readily available background features from ID images, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical benchmarks focus on general tasks and inadequately assess performance in specialized domains like spine medicine that heavily rely on visual input.

Method: Created SpineBench by integrating and standardizing open-source spinal disease datasets, generating challenging hard negative options based on visual similarity to simulate real-world scenarios.

Result: Evaluation of 12 leading MLLMs revealed poor performance in spinal tasks, highlighting current limitations in the spine domain.

Conclusion: SpineBench identifies gaps in MLLM capabilities for spinal medicine and provides guidance for future improvements in this specialized medical application.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAGS introduces semantic priorities into 3D reconstruction to improve efficiency and quality by focusing resources on safety-critical objects while simplifying non-critical elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dynamic 3D urban scene reconstruction methods face a trade-off between fidelity and computational cost due to semantically agnostic resource allocation that treats all scene elements equally.

Method: Two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and Regularization using hybrid importance metrics to simplify non-critical elements while preserving critical objects; (2) Priority-Driven Rendering with priority-based depth pre-pass to cull occluded primitives and accelerate shading.

Result: Achieves exceptional reconstruction quality on safety-critical objects while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to over 350 FPS on Waymo and KITTI datasets.

Conclusion: PAGS effectively addresses the fidelity-efficiency trade-off in dynamic 3D urban scene reconstruction by incorporating semantic priorities into the reconstruction pipeline.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

*Jianfeng Dong,Lei Huang,Daizong Liu,Xianke Chen,Xun Yang,Changting Lin,Xun Wang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DL-DKD++, a dual learning framework with dynamic knowledge distillation for partially relevant video retrieval, transferring knowledge from large vision-language models to lightweight task-specific networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world videos are untrimmed with complex background content, making traditional text-to-video retrieval methods impractical. The paper addresses the challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) where only parts of long videos are relevant to queries.

Method: Uses a dual learning framework with dynamic knowledge distillation: a large teacher model supervises a compact dual-branch student network. The student has an inheritance branch for transferable knowledge and an exploration branch for task-specific learning. Implements dynamic soft-target construction to replace rigid hard-target supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR.

Conclusion: The proposed DL-DKD++ framework effectively handles partially relevant video retrieval by distilling knowledge from large pre-trained models and adapting to domain-specific requirements through dual-branch learning and dynamic supervision.

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs hallucinate brand names from logos even when no text is visible, particularly for circular logos, due to symbolic priors rather than visual perception. Hallucinations persist under distortions and are tied to specific projector dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs show impressive multimodal reasoning but remain vulnerable to hallucinations where outputs aren't grounded in visual evidence. Logo hallucination is an overlooked problem where models generate brand names from logos containing no visible text.

Method: Used curated logo datasets (pure symbols, hybrids, text-bearing logos, Hard-60 subset) with nine structured perturbations. Conducted embedding-level analysis with LLaVA, identifying projector dimensions responsible for hallucinations and performing targeted ablation.

Result: Hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion being most problematic. Targeted ablation of specific projector dimensions substantially reduces errors while preserving OCR accuracy. Circular logos are particularly susceptible.

Conclusion: VLMs rely on symbolic priors rather than genuine glyph perception for logos. Projector subspaces play a decisive role in hallucination failures. Projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding are promising mitigation directions for more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of generating realistic novel views of urban environments from different traversals (e.g., different lanes or directions) for autonomous driving simulation.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Fit 3D scene reconstruction using Gaussian splatting and render novel views, 2) Enhance frames with single-step diffusion model. Includes specific initialization techniques and data curation.

Result: Achieved aggregated score of 0.432 on public leaderboard, placing second overall. Performance validated by PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics.

Conclusion: The hybrid Gaussian splatting + diffusion model approach effectively addresses novel view synthesis in street scenes, demonstrating competitive performance in the challenge.

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place

TL;DR: CurriFlow is a semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion for improved 3D semantic scene completion from monocular images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSC methods relying on temporal stacking or depth projection lack explicit motion reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision in autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: Uses multi-level fusion strategy with pre-trained optical flow for temporal alignment, curriculum learning from LiDAR to stereo depth, and semantic priors from SAM for category-agnostic supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI benchmark with mean IoU of 16.9, demonstrating improved temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding.

Conclusion: The motion-guided and curriculum-aware design effectively addresses challenges in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, validating the approach's effectiveness.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

### [43] [Deep Attention-guided Adaptive Subsampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12376)
*Sharath M Shankaranarayana,Soumava Kumar Roy,Prasad Sudhakar,Chandan Aladahalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel learnable subsampling framework that uses attention-guided sampling to dynamically adapt to different inputs, reducing computational complexity while maintaining performance in 3D medical imaging and video classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often achieve performance gains at the cost of increased computational complexity, and many tasks like 3D volume or video classification contain redundant slices/frames that don't all need to be processed.

Method: An attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs during inference, overcoming the non-differentiability of subsampling operations and providing input-adaptive sampling rather than just task-adaptive sampling.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D and two ultrasound video datasets, including a challenging real-world clinical dataset, achieving performance gains while reducing complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed input-adaptive subsampling framework successfully addresses the limitations of static sampling methods, enabling dynamic adaptation to different inputs for improved efficiency and performance in deep neural networks.

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

TL;DR: STORM-PSR is a dual-stream framework for procedure step recognition that combines spatial and temporal features to handle partial occlusion, reducing prediction delays by 11.2-26.1% compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PSR models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in individual frames, neglecting temporal features which limits robustness and accuracy, especially when objects are partially occluded.

Method: A dual-stream framework with assembly state detection stream for unobstructed views and spatio-temporal stream with spatial encoder (pre-trained using weak supervision) and transformer-based temporal encoder to capture spatial-temporal relationships.

Result: Reduced average delay between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% on MECCANO and 26.1% on IndustReal datasets compared to prior methods, with the spatio-temporal stream enabling step recognition without requiring unobstructed object views.

Conclusion: STORM-PSR effectively handles partial occlusion in procedure step recognition by leveraging both spatial and temporal features, demonstrating significant improvements over frame-based approaches.

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

*Wenjing Bian,Axel Barroso-Laguna,Tommaso Cavallari,Victor Adrian Prisacariu,Eric Brachmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a probabilistic reinterpretation of scene coordinate regression (SCR) models that incorporates reconstruction priors to prevent model degeneration when training images have insufficient multi-view constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCR models trained with insufficient multi-view constraints can degenerate, leading to poor scene representations and downstream task performance.

Method: Proposes probabilistic SCR training with reconstruction priors, including depth distribution priors and learned priors using a 3D point cloud diffusion model trained on indoor scans.

Result: The priors help learn better scene representations, producing more coherent point clouds, higher registration rates, better camera poses, and improved performance on novel view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Conclusion: Incorporating reconstruction priors into SCR training effectively prevents degeneration and improves scene representation quality across multiple indoor datasets.

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This systematic review examines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for urban infrastructure monitoring, analyzing 32 studies from 2021-2025 to understand their applications, architectures, datasets, and performance in zero-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban monitoring methods using IoT sensors and manual inspections are costly, difficult to scale, and misaligned with citizens' visual perception. VLMs offer potential to enable machines to 'see' and reason about urban infrastructure like humans do.

Method: Conducted systematic review following PRISMA methodology, analyzing 32 peer-reviewed studies to address four research questions about VLM applications, architectures, datasets, and evaluation methods in urban monitoring.

Result: The review identified effective urban monitoring tasks addressed by VLMs, commonly used architectures and frameworks, supporting datasets and resources, and reported performance levels across different applications.

Conclusion: VLMs show promise as a transformative technology for urban infrastructure monitoring, particularly in zero-shot applications, though further research is needed to fully realize their potential in aligning with citizen perception.

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

*Huu Tien Nguyen,Ahmed Karam Eldaly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using conditional flow matching (CFM) for image quality transfer, specifically for enhancing low-field MRI images to high-field quality without expensive infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-field MRI offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality, creating a need to bridge the quality gap without requiring expensive infrastructure.

Method: Uses conditional flow matching (CFM) which learns a continuous flow between noise distribution and target data distributions through direct regression of an optimal velocity field, unlike conventional generative models that rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives.

Result: CFM achieves state-of-the-art performance, generalizes robustly to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, and utilizes significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.

Conclusion: CFM shows potential as a powerful and scalable tool for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

*Jialong Zuo,Yongtai Deng,Lingdong Kong,Jingkang Yang,Rui Jin,Yiwei Zhang,Nong Sang,Liang Pan,Ziwei Liu,Changxin Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoLucy is a deep memory backtracking framework for long video understanding that uses hierarchical memory and iterative backtracking to overcome limitations of current LLM-based systems in capturing temporal context and preserving critical details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent-based systems using LLMs for long video understanding struggle with temporal context of consecutive frames and risk losing crucial information due to sparse frame sampling, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with progressive granularity inspired by human recollection, using agent-based iterative backtracking to systematically mine video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is gathered.

Result: VideoLucy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks, achieving performance that surpasses even proprietary models like GPT-4o, while being built on open-source models.

Conclusion: The proposed VideoLucy framework effectively addresses temporal understanding challenges in long videos while preserving critical details, demonstrating superior performance through its hierarchical memory and backtracking approach.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey provides the first comprehensive review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG), addressing the gap in existing literature that primarily focuses on single image chest X-ray report generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional single-image approaches in chest X-ray radiology report generation, which fail to capture longitudinal context necessary for clinically faithful comparison statements that mirror radiologists' diagnostic workflows.

Method: The survey examines dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures with longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols including longitudinal-specific measures and widely used benchmarks.

Result: The analysis highlights the critical role of longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model performance, with summaries of LRRG methods' performance and ablation studies.

Conclusion: The survey identifies five major limitations of current research and outlines promising directions for future development to advance the emerging field of longitudinal radiology report generation.

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-GAGA is a two-stage adversarial attack framework that generates transferable and imperceptible adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create effective adversarial attacks against deepfake detectors that work across different unseen models while maintaining visual imperceptibility.

Method: Two-stage approach: Stage 1 uses dual-stream attack (MNTD-PGD for small perturbations and SG-PGD for salient regions) to generate candidates; Stage 2 employs metric-aware selection based on attack success and SSIM similarity.

Result: Achieves up to 27% higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art attacks.

Conclusion: MS-GAGA effectively balances transferability and imperceptibility in adversarial attacks against deepfake detectors.

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem where traditional data augmentations disrupt spatial alignment between images and text in multimodal learning for medical image segmentation, weakening performance.

Method: Propose early fusion framework combining text and visual features before augmentation, with a lightweight generator that projects text embeddings into visual space to bridge semantic gaps.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on three medical imaging tasks and four segmentation frameworks, with visualization showing accurate region localization.

Conclusion: The proposed early fusion approach effectively preserves spatial consistency between text and images during augmentation, enabling improved multimodal medical image segmentation performance.

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly

TL;DR: Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting (BSGS) addresses 3D scene reconstruction from motion-blurred images using a two-stage approach with camera pose refinement and global rigid transformation, plus subframe gradient aggregation and space-time optimization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods suffer from extreme dependence on accurate camera poses and inability to control erroneous Gaussian primitive densification caused by motion blur, limiting their performance.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Camera Pose Refinement to reduce motion-induced distortions, 2) Global Rigid Transformation to correct blur distortions with fixed poses. Uses subframe gradient aggregation to alleviate gradient conflicts and space-time bi-stage optimization to adjust primitive densification thresholds.

Result: Comprehensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed deblurring method and show superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: BSGS successfully addresses the challenges of 3D scene reconstruction from motion-blurred images through its bi-stage optimization approach and specialized strategies for handling motion blur distortions.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

TL;DR: VAD is a lightweight, network-free method that computes Unsigned Distance Fields from unoriented point clouds using Voronoi-based normal alignment and diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural approaches for learning UDFs suffer from numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability.

Method: First assigns bi-directional normals to input points using Voronoi-based geometric criteria, then diffuses aligned normals to form approximate UDF gradient field, and finally integrates to recover the final UDF.

Result: VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces, as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining computationally efficient and stable.

Conclusion: The proposed VAD method provides an effective alternative to neural approaches for computing UDFs, offering better stability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

TL;DR: A diffusion model achieves state-of-the-art human motion generation using only careful normalization and analytic loss weightings, avoiding complex features and auxiliary losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on over-parameterized features and auxiliary losses, which should not be necessary for diffusion models to match human motion distribution.

Method: Score-based diffusion model with feature-space normalization and analytically derived weightings for L2 score-matching loss, generating motion and shape directly.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation without slow post hoc shape recovery.

Conclusion: Careful normalization and analytic loss weightings are sufficient for diffusion models to match human motion distribution effectively.

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning suffer from poor generalization, while reinforcement learning faces sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. Combining both approaches can overcome these limitations.

Method: Proposes CoIRL-AD, a competitive dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during training with a competition-based mechanism that facilitates knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes dataset show 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines, along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail scenarios.

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD effectively combines IL and RL through competitive interaction, achieving better performance and generalization than conventional two-stage approaches in autonomous driving.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the
nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines,

TL;DR: MMOT is the first drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking benchmark addressing limitations of RGB tracking in aerial views through spectral features and oriented annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based tracking algorithms degrade in aerial views due to small targets, occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Multispectral imagery provides spectral reflectance cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial conditions.

Method: Proposed a multispectral and orientation-aware MOT scheme with: (1) lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem for spectral feature integration, (2) orientation-aware Kalman filter for precise state estimation, and (3) end-to-end orientation-adaptive transformer.

Result: Extensive experiments show multispectral input significantly improves tracking performance over RGB baselines, especially for small and densely packed objects.

Conclusion: The MMOT benchmark and proposed methods advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research, with publicly available dataset, code, and benchmarks.

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our

Motivation: Existing methods using cross-attention struggle with step-by-step temporal alignment when learning human motion based on time-dependent input signals.

Method: Integrates conditional information into the recurrent dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion generation.

Result: Significantly improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over state-of-the-art approaches across various human motion tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed Temporally Conditional Mamba model effectively addresses temporal alignment limitations in human motion generation by leveraging Mamba's recurrent dynamics.

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

TL;DR: Zero-shot segmentation for agricultural imagery using Plantnet with DinoV2 backbone and SAM, eliminating need for new datasets and annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the annotation bottleneck in agricultural image segmentation and overcome limitations of supervised methods in complex field conditions with limited training data.

Method: Leverages Plantnet's plant representations to identify plant regions and generate coarse masks, then refines them using Segment Anything Model (SAM) for detailed segmentations.

Result: Consistent performance gains with Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over base DinoV2 model across four datasets, measured by improved Jaccard Index (IoU).

Conclusion: Combining foundation models with specialized plant-centric models effectively alleviates annotation requirements and enables robust segmentation in diverse agricultural scenarios.

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

*Yasaman Haghighi,Bastien van Delft,Mariam Hassan,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerSync is a domain-agnostic approach that improves diffusion model training efficiency and generation quality by using the model's own intermediate representations as intrinsic guidance, eliminating the need for external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research showed that external guidance on diffusion model intermediate representations accelerates training, but this requires additional resources. The authors aim to create a self-sufficient method that leverages the model's own representations without external dependencies.

Method: LayerSync regularizes diffusion models by using their own intermediate representations, where semantically rich representations guide weaker ones. It's a plug-and-play regularizer with no training overhead that works across multiple domains.

Result: LayerSync consistently improves generation quality and training efficiency across image, audio, video, and motion generation domains. It achieved 8.75x training speedup for flow-based transformers on ImageNet and 23.6% quality improvement.

Conclusion: LayerSync provides an effective, resource-efficient approach for improving diffusion models by leveraging intrinsic representation guidance, making it applicable across multiple domains without requiring pretrained models or additional data.

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at

*Jiachen Lei,Keli Liu,Julius Berner,Haiming Yu,Hongkai Zheng,Jiahong Wu,Xiangxiang Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-stage training framework that closes the performance gap between pixel-space and latent-space generative models for diffusion and consistency models, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-space generative models are more difficult to train and underperform compared to latent-space models, creating a persistent performance and efficiency gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: Two-stage training: (1) pre-train encoders to capture semantics from clean images and align them with sampling trajectories, (2) integrate encoder with randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune end-to-end for both diffusion and consistency models.

Result: Diffusion model achieves FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75 NFE, surpassing prior pixel-space methods. Consistency model achieves FID of 8.82 on ImageNet-256 in single step, significantly outperforming latent-space counterpart.

Conclusion: The framework successfully closes the performance gap for pixel-space models, enabling training of consistency models directly on high-resolution images without pre-trained VAEs or diffusion models for the first time.

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IVT-LR introduces multimodal latent reasoning that combines visual and textual information in latent space, eliminating the need for explicit reasoning steps and achieving 5.45% accuracy improvement with 5x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning methods require explicit reasoning steps with labor-intensive vision-text annotations and introduce significant inference latency.

Method: Proposed Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR) that represents reasoning steps using latent text (hidden states) and latent vision (selected image embeddings), with progressive multi-stage training.

Result: Achieved 5.45% average accuracy improvement on M3CoT and ScienceQA benchmarks while achieving over 5x speed increase compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: IVT-LR enables efficient multimodal reasoning in latent space, reducing annotation requirements and inference latency while improving performance.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing USOD methods ignore underwater imaging physics or treat degradation as noise, failing to exploit valuable information in underwater image characteristics.

Method: Proposes WaterFlow framework using rectified flow-based approach that explicitly incorporates underwater physical imaging priors into network training and introduces temporal dimension modeling.

Result: Achieves 0.072 gain in S_m metric on USOD10K dataset, demonstrating significant performance improvement over existing methods.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages underwater physical imaging information and temporal modeling to enhance salient object detection in challenging underwater environments.

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZSCFC is an efficient zero-shot denoiser that uses cross-frequency consistency to remove noise from single images without noise distribution assumptions, outperforming existing methods in speed and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot denoisers have long training times and rely on unrealistic noise assumptions (independence and zero-mean), limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with complex noise characteristics.

Method: Proposed ZSCFC method uses cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network, leveraging that image textures show position similarity and content consistency across frequency bands while noise does not.

Result: Experiments on various real-world image datasets show ZSCFC outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in both computational efficiency and denoising performance.

Conclusion: ZSCFC provides an effective and efficient solution for real-world denoising that works with single noisy images without requiring noise distribution assumptions.

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

*Shuhei Tarashima,Yushan Wang,Norio Tagawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops efficient human mesh recovery (HMR) and human pose estimation (HPE) models by using early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models as encoders, achieving comparable performance to full models with better computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art HMR methods rely on large, non-hierarchical vision transformers, which are computationally expensive. The authors aim to create more efficient alternatives by leveraging hierarchical vision foundation models.

Method: The authors construct lightweight HMR variants and propose using only the first two or three stages of hierarchical VFMs (Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, VMamba) as encoders, since these early stages produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to non-hierarchical models.

Result: Evaluation of 27 hierarchical-VFM-based models shows that truncated models using only early stages achieve performance on par with full-stage models while offering better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing lightweight alternatives.

Conclusion: Using early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models as encoders provides an effective approach for developing efficient HMR and HPE models without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

TL;DR: TerraCodec (TEC) is a family of learned compression codecs specifically designed for Earth observation data, achieving 3-10x better compression than classical methods while enabling zero-shot cloud inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth observation satellites generate massive multispectral image time series that pose storage and transmission challenges. Current compression methods are inadequate - image codecs ignore temporal redundancy while video codecs fail to capture radiometric evolution of static scenes.

Method: TEC includes image-based variants for multispectral inputs and a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages temporal dependencies. Introduces Latent Repacking for training flexible-rate transformer models that can operate at varying rate-distortion settings.

Result: Trained on Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs with 3-10x stronger compression at equivalent quality. TEC-TT enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the AllClear benchmark.

Conclusion: Bespoke, learned compression algorithms are a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model weights will be released under a permissive license.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BEV-based approaches for UAV swarm systems have limitations: bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic/geometric information, and performance degrades with undefined/occluded objects.

Method: Proposes a framework with Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder, Cross-Agent Feature Integration, Altitude-Aware Feature Reduction for efficiency, and Dual-Mask Perceptual Guidance for adaptive feature selection and communication reduction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly outperforms existing collaborative methods, and reduces communication overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed occupancy prediction framework effectively addresses limitations of BEV-based approaches and enables efficient multi-UAV collaborative perception with superior performance and reduced communication costs.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

TL;DR: EReLiFM addresses Open-Set Domain Generalization with Noisy Labels using evidential reliability-aware clustering and residual flow matching to improve domain transfer and handle label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise corrupts source-domain knowledge in Open-Set Domain Generalization, making it difficult to recognize known classes and reject unseen ones. Existing methods struggle with domain gaps when clean labeled data is limited.

Method: Proposes Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning: 1) Unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering for label reliability awareness, 2) Residual flow matching mechanism modeling domain- and category-conditioned residuals for uncertainty-aware transfer paths, 3) Meta-learning optimization where clean set updates maximize loss decrease on noisy set using pseudo labels.

Result: EReLiFM outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art performance in experimental results.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively handles label noise in open-set domain generalization through evidential reliability awareness and residual flow matching, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models in medical imaging often learn spurious correlations leading to biases and limited generalization, while human-AI attention alignment requires costly manual supervision.

Method: Hybrid Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework with self-supervised component using class-distinctive attention without restrictive priors, combined with human-guided constraints.

Result: H-EGL outperforms two state-of-the-art EGL methods on chest X-ray classification using ViT, achieving superior classification accuracy, generalization capability, and better attention map alignment with human expertise.

Conclusion: The proposed H-EGL framework effectively enhances attention alignment and improves generalization in medical imaging transformers without relying on costly manual supervision.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

TL;DR: IRIS is a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to actively manipulate and reason with images (think with images) rather than just passively perceive them, showing current models struggle with this capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs treat images as static inputs, but real-world applications require active image manipulation (cropping, editing, enhancement) to solve complex tasks - a capability that remains underexplored.

Method: Introduces IRIS benchmark with 1,204 challenging vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) across five domains, evaluating MLLMs' ability to perceive, transform, and reason with images through detailed rubrics.

Result: Current MLLMs perform poorly on IRIS, with the strongest model (GPT-5-think) achieving only 18.68% pass rate. Models show divergent tool-use behaviors - OpenAI models benefit from diverse image manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement.

Conclusion: IRIS provides the first benchmark for 'think with images' paradigm, revealing significant gaps in MLLMs' visual reasoning capabilities and offering critical insights for advancing visual intelligence.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

TL;DR: A personalized federated fine-tuning method using orthogonal LoRA adapters to separate general and client-specific knowledge for medical AI foundation models, enabling better data utilization while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models in healthcare require fine-tuning for specific tasks, but data sharing restrictions due to privacy concerns limit available training data. Federated learning offers a solution but needs better personalization methods.

Method: Proposes personalized federated fine-tuning using orthogonal LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters to disentangle general knowledge (shared across clients) from client-specific knowledge, allowing each client to benefit from both their own data and others' data.

Result: Preliminary results on real-world federated medical imaging tasks show the approach is competitive against current federated fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: The orthogonal LoRA adapter method enables effective personalized federated fine-tuning of foundation models for healthcare applications while maintaining data privacy.

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

TL;DR: FlashVSR is a diffusion-based one-step streaming framework for real-time video super-resolution that achieves 17 FPS for 768x1408 videos on A100 GPU through three innovations: train-friendly distillation pipeline, locality-constrained sparse attention, and tiny conditional decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for video super-resolution suffer from high latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high resolutions, making them impractical for real-world applications.

Method: Three complementary innovations: (1) train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline for streaming super-resolution, (2) locality-constrained sparse attention to reduce redundant computation and bridge train-test resolution gap, (3) tiny conditional decoder for accelerated reconstruction without quality loss. Also created VSR-120K dataset with 120k videos and 180k images.

Conclusion: FlashVSR makes diffusion-based video super-resolution practical by achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance, with code, models, and dataset to be released for future research.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

### [72] [SPORTS: Simultaneous Panoptic Odometry, Rendering, Tracking and Segmentation for Urban Scenes Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12749)
*Zhiliu Yang,Jinyu Dai,Jianyuan Zhang,Zhu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPORTS is a unified framework that integrates Video Panoptic Segmentation, Visual Odometry, and Scene Rendering to address scene understanding challenges like segmentation deficiency, dynamic object interference, and view limitations through iterative optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene perception solutions suffer from segmentation deficiencies, dynamic object interference, sensor data sparsity, and view limitations, which hinder embodied-AI agents' ability to understand and simulate scenes effectively.

Method: The framework integrates three tasks: VPS uses adaptive attention-based geometric fusion with pose, depth, and optical flow alignment; VO combines panoptic segmentation with optical flow for better camera pose estimation; SR transforms sparse point clouds into neural fields for high-fidelity view synthesis.

Result: Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that the attention-based feature fusion outperforms most state-of-the-art methods in odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

Conclusion: SPORTS successfully demonstrates that tightly integrating VPS, VO, and SR into an iterative unified framework enables holistic scene understanding and overcomes key limitations in existing scene perception approaches.

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

*A. Alfarano,L. Venturoli,D. Negueruela del Castillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQArt-Bench is a new VQA benchmark for cultural heritage that reveals significant limitations in current MLLMs, including weaknesses in counting tasks and performance gaps between proprietary and open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA benchmarks fail to evaluate deep semantic understanding in complex domains like visual art analysis, as they use simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes that encourage models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than engage in visual reasoning.

Method: A novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse questions, structured along relevant visual understanding dimensions that probe symbolic meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships.

Result: Evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs revealed significant limitations, including surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

Conclusion: VQArt-Bench addresses the gap in evaluating deep semantic understanding in VQA and exposes critical weaknesses in current multimodal models, particularly in complex domains requiring sophisticated visual reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

*Wenpu Li,Bangyan Liao,Yi Zhou,Qi Xu,Pian Wan,Peidong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MoFlow: An unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes ego-motion and optical flow using implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization, achieving state-of-the-art performance without ground truth supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches treat optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion estimation as separate problems, which becomes ill-posed for neuromorphic vision (event cameras) due to lack of robust data association. Existing methods either introduce bias through explicit regularization or converge to suboptimal solutions.

Method: Models camera ego-motion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an implicit neural representation, embedding spatial-temporal coherence through inductive biases. Incorporates structure-and-motion priors via differential geometric constraints without explicit depth estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive results even with supervised approaches. Demonstrates versatility in general 6-DoF motion scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed E-MoFlow framework successfully unifies ego-motion and optical flow estimation through implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm, overcoming limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DL-HMC++ is a deep learning approach for head motion correction in PET imaging that predicts rigid head motion from 1-second 3D PET raw data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and achieving results comparable to gold-standard hardware motion tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head movement in PET imaging causes artifacts and quantification inaccuracies, while hardware-based motion tracking has limited clinical applicability. A data-driven solution is needed to make motion correction accessible in real-world clinical practice.

Method: Deep-learning head motion correction with cross-attention (DL-HMC++) trained in supervised manner using dynamic PET scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external hardware motion tracking. Evaluated on two PET scanners and four radiotracers.

Result: DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven methods, producing motion-free images with clear brain structure delineation and reduced artifacts indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Average difference ratios with HMT: 1.2±0.5% for HRRT and 0.5±0.2% for mCT.

Conclusion: DL-HMC++ demonstrates potential for data-driven PET head motion correction to eliminate the burden of hardware motion tracking, making motion correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings.

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyUp is a feature-agnostic upsampling method that works with any vision feature at any resolution without encoder-specific training, outperforming existing methods and generalizing across feature types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based upsamplers require retraining for each feature extractor and don't generalize to different feature types at inference time, limiting their practical application.

Method: Proposed an inference-time feature-agnostic upsampling architecture that doesn't require encoder-specific training and can handle any vision feature at any resolution.

Result: AnyUp sets new state-of-the-art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, preserves feature semantics, and is efficient for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: AnyUp provides a versatile and high-quality feature upsampling solution that overcomes the limitations of encoder-specific upsamplers and enables broader application across vision tasks.

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a benchmark for Efficient Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR), aiming to match or exceed Real-ESRGAN's perceptual quality while maintaining strict efficiency constraints of ≤5M parameters and ≤2000 GFLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a significant gap between efficient PSNR-oriented super-resolution methods and perceptual quality approaches, with the latter remaining relatively inefficient despite progress in the former.

Method: Proposed efficient solutions evaluated on a novel 500-image 4K dataset with multiple degradation types, simulating realistic deployment conditions without original high-quality counterparts.

Result: The top-performing approach successfully outperformed Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets while meeting the strict efficiency constraints.

Conclusion: The paper establishes modern baselines for efficient perceptual super-resolution, demonstrating the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

### [78] [Uncertainty Matters in Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Monocular 4D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12768)
*Fengzhi Guo,Chih-Chuan Hsu,Sihao Ding,Cheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USplat4D introduces uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting to improve 4D reconstruction by modeling per-Gaussian uncertainty and using it to guide motion optimization, addressing issues of motion drift under occlusion and degraded synthesis at extreme viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic 3D scene reconstruction from monocular input is challenging due to ambiguities from occlusion and extreme novel views. Vanilla dynamic Gaussian Splatting models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring observation reliability, which leads to motion drifts under occlusion and poor synthesis at unseen views.

Method: USplat4D estimates time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Gaussians with recurring observations across views and time serve as reliable anchors to guide motion, while those with limited visibility are treated as less reliable.

Result: Experiments on diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

Conclusion: The proposed uncertainty-aware framework enhances 4D reconstruction by propagating reliable motion cues, demonstrating that explicitly modeling uncertainty is crucial for improving dynamic Gaussian Splatting performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

### [79] [What If : Understanding Motion Through Sparse Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12777)
*Stefan Andreas Baumann,Nick Stracke,Timy Phan,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPT is a novel framework that predicts local motion distributions from sparse interactions called "pokes", providing interpretable multi-modal scene motion representations with inherent uncertainty modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods only enable dense sampling of single realizations of scene dynamics, lacking interpretable representations of multi-modal motion and uncertainty in physical interactions.

Method: Flow Poke Transformer (FPT) directly predicts distributions of local motion conditioned on sparse "poke" interactions, using a transformer-based architecture for interpretable motion representation.

Result: FPT surpasses specialized baselines on dense face motion generation, achieves significant improvements in articulated object motion estimation, and shows competitive performance on moving part segmentation from pokes.

Conclusion: FPT provides a flexible and versatile framework for predicting explicit motion distributions, enabling better performance across various downstream tasks compared to prior methods.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

*Weiyang Jin,Yuwei Niu,Jiaqi Liao,Chengqi Duan,Aoxue Li,Shenghua Gao,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRUM is a self-rewarding post-training framework that enables Unified Multimodal Models to use their understanding module to reward and improve their generation module, achieving self-improvement without additional human data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a significant gap where models' strong visual understanding capabilities don't transfer to visual generation - models can understand images but can't generate faithful images from text prompts. This raises the question of whether models can achieve self-improvement by using understanding to reward generation.

Method: SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's understanding module acts as an internal evaluator, providing corrective signals to improve generation. It uses a global-local dual reward system: global reward ensures overall visual semantics and layout correctness, while local reward refines fine-grained object-level fidelity.

Result: SRUM significantly boosts performance on benchmarks: T2I-CompBench improved from 82.18 to 88.37, and T2I-ReasonBench improved from 43.82 to 46.75. It shows strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The work establishes a new paradigm for enabling Unified Multimodal Models' understanding module to guide and enhance their own generation via self-rewarding, bridging the gap between understanding and generation capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVP4D generates animatable multi-view 4D human avatars from a single reference image using a video diffusion model, improving realism and 3D consistency over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for creating photorealistic human avatars are expensive and time-consuming, requiring large camera rigs and manual effort. While recent single-image methods lower barriers, they lack multi-view constraints and degrade from novel viewpoints.

Method: Based on a pre-trained video diffusion model, MVP4D generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying up to 360 degrees around a subject, then distills outputs into real-time renderable 4D avatars.

Result: The approach significantly improves realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of generated avatars compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: MVP4D enables high-quality animatable multi-view avatar generation from single images, overcoming limitations of previous single-image approaches through multi-view video generation.

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFusion is a diffusion-based generative model that uses a frozen vision-language model as a unified multimodal encoder, featuring Layerwise Attention Pooling for better cross-modal reasoning and VERIFI for flexible inference with in-model prompt rewriting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing architectures use separate encoders for images and text, limiting cross-modal reasoning and knowledge transfer. Previous unified approaches require substantial computational resources and large-scale data, making them inaccessible.

Method: Uses frozen VLM as unified encoder with Layerwise Attention Pooling (LAP) to extract both high-level semantics and low-level details from text/visual tokens. Proposes VERIFI for conditioning diffusion transformer on VLM-generated text tokens during in-model prompt rewriting.

Result: LAP outperforms other fusion architectures on text-image alignment and visual information transfer. Finetuning on editing improves text-image alignment and shows cross-modality knowledge transfer. Model zero-shot generalizes from single to multiple image references.

Conclusion: UniFusion demonstrates effective cross-modal knowledge transfer through unified encoder design, enabling improved generation quality, editing capabilities, and generalization without requiring joint training of large models.

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

TL;DR: ViCO reduces MLLM inference costs by dynamically adjusting vision token count based on image semantic complexity, achieving up to 50% token reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs suffer from high inference costs due to excessive vision tokens from image inputs, creating efficiency bottlenecks.

Method: Uses multiple MLP connectors with different compression ratios to downsample vision tokens based on semantic complexity, with KL divergence minimization during training and a Visual Resolution Router for automatic compression rate selection at inference.

Result: Achieves up to 50% reduction in vision tokens while preserving model's perception, reasoning, and OCR capabilities.

Conclusion: ViCO enables more efficient MLLMs by dynamically adapting token count to semantic complexity rather than image resolution, contributing to cost-effective multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

*Caner Korkmaz,Brighton Nuwagira,Barış Coşkunuzer,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuMPerLay is a differentiable vectorization layer that integrates Cubical Multiparameter Persistence into deep learning, enabling topological feature learning for image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the complexity of multifiltration structures and vectorization challenges in Cubical Multiparameter Persistence, making it usable in deep learning pipelines.

Method: Decomposes CMP into learnable single-parameter persistence components with jointly learned bifiltration functions, creating differentiable topological feature vectors.

Result: Shows improved classification and segmentation performance on medical imaging and computer vision datasets, especially in limited-data scenarios.

Conclusion: CuMPerLay provides a promising approach for integrating global structural topological information into deep networks for structured image analysis.

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

TL;DR: DriveVLA-W0 addresses the supervision deficit in Vision-Language-Action models by using world modeling to predict future images, creating dense self-supervised signals that improve driving intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models suffer from supervision deficit where their large capacity is underutilized due to sparse, low-dimensional action supervision, limiting their ability to learn driving environment dynamics.

Method: Proposes DriveVLA-W0 training paradigm with world modeling to predict future images, implemented as autoregressive world model for discrete visual tokens and diffusion world model for continuous visual features, plus lightweight action expert for real-time inference.

Result: Significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines on NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and large in-house dataset, showing amplified data scaling law where performance gains accelerate with larger training datasets.

Conclusion: World modeling effectively addresses VLA supervision deficit, enabling better utilization of model capacity and improved driving intelligence through dense self-supervised learning of environmental dynamics.

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rex-Omni is a 3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object detection performance comparable to regression-based models like DINO and Grounding DINO in zero-shot settings, enabled by novel task formulation, data engines, and training pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional coordinate regression-based object detection models dominate the field, while MLLMs face challenges like low recall, duplicate predictions, and coordinate misalignment. This work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Three key designs: 1) Task formulation using special tokens for quantized coordinates (0-999), 2) Multiple data engines for generating high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, 3) Two-stage training with supervised fine-tuning on 22M data and GRPO-based reinforcement post-training with geometry-aware rewards.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to or exceeding regression-based models on COCO and LVIS benchmarks in zero-shot setting. Enables versatile capabilities including object referring, pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and key-pointing.

Conclusion: Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual perception systems by successfully bridging the gap between traditional regression-based models and MLLM approaches.

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepMMSearch-R1 is a multimodal LLM that performs on-demand web searches with dynamic query crafting for both image and text search, using a two-stage training pipeline and a novel multimodal VQA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM approaches suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and poorly constructed queries, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes in handling information-seeking and knowledge-intensive queries.

Method: Two-stage training pipeline: cold start supervised finetuning followed by online reinforcement learning optimization. Uses DeepMMSearchVQA dataset with multimodal queries that teach when to search, what to search for, which tool to use, and how to reason over retrieved information.

Result: Extensive experiments across knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the approach, with the model capable of initiating searches based on image crops and iteratively adapting text queries for self-reflection and correction.

Conclusion: The analysis provides valuable insights for advancing multimodal web-search, showing that dynamic query crafting and multi-turn search capabilities significantly improve performance in handling real-world information-seeking tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

TL;DR: This paper investigates beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) architecture design and optimization under a physics-consistent electromagnetic model, showing that band-connected RIS achieves the same channel-shaping capability as fully-connected RIS, and develops optimization algorithms for various communication systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing BD-RIS studies rely on simplified channel models that ignore practical electromagnetic effects like mutual coupling and impedance mismatching, creating a gap between theory and practical implementation.

Method: The authors build on a physics-consistent model derived from multiport network theory, develop closed-form solutions for SISO systems, a globally optimal SDR-based algorithm for single-stream MIMO, and an efficient ADMM-based algorithm for multiuser MIMO systems.

Result: Band-connected RIS achieves the same channel-shaping capability as fully-connected RIS under the physics-consistent model. Comprehensive simulations evaluate the impact of various EM effects and approximations on system performance.

Conclusion: The paper provides practical optimization methods for BD-RIS under realistic electromagnetic constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical models and practical implementation while demonstrating the equivalence between band-connected and fully-connected RIS architectures.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for future
wireless communication systems. Conventional RIS is constrained to a diagonal
scattering matrix, which limits its flexibility. Recently, beyond-diagonal RIS
(BD-RIS) has been proposed as a more general RIS architecture class that allows
inter-element connections and shows great potential for performance
improvement. Despite extensive progress on BD-RIS, most existing studies rely
on simplified channel models that ignore practical electromagnetic (EM) effects
such as mutual coupling and impedance mismatching. To address this gap, this
paper investigates the architecture design and optimization of BD-RIS under the
general physics-consistent model derived with multiport network theory in
recent literature. Building on a compact reformulation of this model, we show
that band-connected RIS achieves the same channel-shaping capability as
fully-connected RIS, which extends existing results obtained for conventional
channel models. We then develop optimization methods under the general
physics-consistent model; specifically, we derive closed-form solutions for
single-input single-output (SISO) systems, propose a globally optimal
semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm for single-stream multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) systems, and design an efficient alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm for multiuser MIMO systems. Using
the proposed algorithms, we conduct comprehensive simulations to evaluate the
impact of various EM effects and approximations, including mutual coupling
among RIS antennas and the commonly adopted unilateral approximation, on system
performance.

TL;DR: Proposes a secure indoor communication scheme using STAR-IRS to protect confidential information from eavesdroppers by dynamically partitioning signals and using GNN-based optimization with FPGA acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To safeguard indoor wireless communication from external eavesdroppers while maintaining reliable transmission to legitimate users.

Method: Uses STAR-IRS deployed on walls/windows to partition signals - reflected signals enhance reception at legitimate user, transmitted signals are modulated with random phase shifts to degrade eavesdropper signal quality. Formulates secrecy rate maximization problem and solves it with GNN-based scheme and FPGA accelerator.

Result: Outperforms conventional and reflection-only schemes in secrecy performance. GNN-based approach achieves superior results compared to MRT, ZF, and MMSE benchmarks. FPGA accelerator enables low inference latency.

Conclusion: The proposed STAR-IRS based secure communication scheme with GNN optimization and FPGA acceleration effectively protects indoor transmissions from eavesdropping while maintaining high performance and low latency.

Abstract: This paper proposes a secure indoor communication scheme based on
simultaneous transmitting and reflecting intelligent reflecting surface
(STAR-IRS). Specifically, a transmitter (Alice) sends confidential information
to its intended user (Bob) indoors, while several eavesdroppers (Eves) lurk
outside. To safeguard the transmission from eavesdropping, the STAR-IRS is
deployed on walls or windows. Upon impinging on the STAR-IRS, the incoming
electromagnetic wave is dynamically partitioned into two components, enabling
both transmission through and reflection from the surface. The reflected signal
is controlled to enhance reception at Bob, while the transmitted signal is
modulated with symbol-level random phase shifts to degrade the signal quality
at Eves. Based on such a setting, the secrecy rate maximization problem is
formulated. To solve it, a graph neural network (GNN)-based scheme is
developed. Furthermore, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based GNN
accelerator is designed to reduce computational latency. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms both the conventional scheme
and the reflection-only scheme in terms of secrecy performance. Moreover, the
GNN-based approach achieves superior results compared to benchmark techniques
such as maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero forcing (ZF), and minimum mean
square error (MMSE) in solving the optimization problem. Finally, experimental
evaluations confirm that the FPGA-based accelerator enables low inference
latency.

TL;DR: A unified probabilistic constellation shaping framework for ISAC that optimizes communication rate while constraining sensing MSE, power, and probability distribution to achieve flexible sensing-communication trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISAC using OFDM signals faces performance degradation due to signaling randomness from finite-alphabet modulations like QAM. Need to improve sensing without compromising communication capability.

Method: Proposed probabilistic constellation shaping framework compatible with matched/mismatched filtering, maximizing communication rate with constraints on sensing CSI MSE, power, and probability distribution.

Result: Simulations and field measurements validate efficient S&C trade-off and credibility in enhancing 6G wireless transmission in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The PCS approach effectively addresses sensing performance degradation while maintaining communication capability, providing a practical solution for 6G ISAC systems.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is considered an innovative
technology in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, where utilizing
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication signals for
sensing provides a cost-effective solution for implementing ISAC. However, the
sensing performance of matched and mismatched filtering schemes can be
significantly deteriorated due to the signaling randomness induced by
finite-alphabet modulations with nonconstant modulus, such as quadrature
amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. Therefore, improving sensing
performance without significantly compromising communication capability (i.e.,
maintaining randomness), remains a challenging task. To that end, we propose a
unified probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) framework that is compatible
with both matched and mismatched filtering schemes, by maximizing the
communication rate while imposing constraints on mean square error (MSE) of
sensing channel state information (CSI), power, and probability distribution.
Specifically, the MSE of sensing CSI is leveraged to optimize sensing
capability, which is illustrated to be a more comprehensive metric compared to
the output SNR after filtering (SNRout) and integrated sidelobes ratio (ISLR).
Additionally, the internal relationships among these three sensing metrics are
explicitly analyzed. Finally, both simulations and field measurements validate
the efficiency of proposed PCS approach in achieving a flexible S&C trade-off,
as well as its credibility in enhancing 6G wireless transmission in real-world
scenarios.

*Benedikt Böck,Amar Kasibovic,Wolfgang Utschick*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Link-level channel models like 3GPP TDL/CDL are inadequate for evaluating ML-based physical-layer methods due to limiting assumptions, distributional shifts, and near-Gaussian characteristics that prevent ML models from outperforming classical approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard link-level channel models used for ML evaluation incorporate limiting assumptions that cause distributional shifts and necessitate impractical online training, while also leading to near-Gaussian characteristics that prevent ML models from demonstrating superior performance.

Method: The paper demonstrates the optimality of simple linear methods for channel compression, estimation, and modeling tasks when using link-level channel models, showing that ML models cannot outperform classical approaches under these conditions.

Result: Analysis reveals that ML-based models trained on link-level channel data do not outperform classical approaches for various physical-layer applications, as link-level models lead to near-Gaussian characteristics where linear methods are optimal.

Conclusion: Adopting a scenario-level perspective instead of link-level channel models offers a solution to enable ML models to achieve relative gains over classical approaches in physical-layer applications.

Abstract: Standardized (link-level) channel models such as the 3GPP TDL and CDL models
are frequently used to evaluate machine learning (ML)-based physical-layer
methods. However, in this work, we argue that a link-level perspective
incorporates limiting assumptions, causing unwanted distributional shifts or
necessitating impractical online training. An additional drawback is that this
perspective leads to (near-)Gaussian channel characteristics. Thus, ML-based
models, trained on link-level channel data, do not outperform classical
approaches for a variety of physical-layer applications. Particularly, we
demonstrate the optimality of simple linear methods for channel compression,
estimation, and modeling, revealing the unsuitability of link-level channel
models for evaluating ML models. On the upside, adopting a scenario-level
perspective offers a solution to this problem and unlocks the relative gains
enabled by ML.

Result: Successfully constructed all 8 circulant Hadamard matrices of order 4, binary CZCS for all even-phase lengths (first such construction), binary GCS for all lengths with flexible flock size, Hadamard matrices of order 2^{n+2}, and optimal CZCSS with specific parameters.

Conclusion: The paper provides novel constructions that fill gaps in existing literature, particularly for binary CZCS covering all lengths. It establishes new relationships between Hadamard matrices and GCS, offering a fresh perspective on the Hadamard conjecture and enabling flexible parameter designs for complementary sequence sets.

Abstract: A Hadamard matrix $H$ is a square matrix of order $n$ with entries $\pm 1$,
such that $HH^\top=nI_{n}$, where $I_n$ is an identity matrix of order $n$. A
circulant Hadamard matrix $H$ is a Hadamard matrix that has rows of entries in
cyclic order. There exist only $8$ circulant Hadamard matrices of order 4, and
here, we provide a novel construction of all such $8$ circulant Hadamard
matrices using a linear operator and generalized Boolean function (GBF). The
constructed circulant Hadamard matrices are used recursively to construct a
binary cross Z-complementary set (CZCS) of all lengths with an even phase, a
binary Golay complementary set (GCS) of all lengths, and Hadamard matrices of
order $2^{n+2}$, where $n\geq1$. The construction of a binary CZCS covering all
lengths was not available before. We also propose an alternative,
lower-complexity construction of binary GCSs of all lengths and Hadamard
matrices of order $2^{a+1}10^b26^c$ using circulant matrices, where $ a,b,c
\geq 0$. The proposed binary GCS covers all lengths with a flexible flock size.
The constructions of GCS are further extended to form binary complete
complementary code (CCC) of the parameter $(2N,2N,2N)-CCC$ where
$N=2^a10^b26^c, a,b,c \geq 0$. The constructed binary CCC provides a flexible
flock size. The construction of CZCS is further extended to form a binary
optimal cross-Z complementary sequence set (CZCSS) of the parameter $(2^{n+2},
2^{n+2}, 2^{n+2}, 2^{n+1})-CZCSS$, where $n\geq1$. Finally, we provide a
relation between Hadamard matrices and GCS, which enables the study of the
Hadamard conjecture in a new direction. We also provided a few properties of
circulant matrices over aperiodic cross-correlation (ACCF) and aperiodic
auto-correlation (AACF), which are used to prove the theorems. All proposed
constructions are novel, and their parameters are compared with the existing
state-of-the-art.

*Zhige Chen,Chengxuan Qin,Wenlong You,Rui Liu,Congying Chu,Rui Yang,Kay Chen Tan,Jibin Wu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: HEAR is the first EEG foundation model designed to handle heterogeneous EEG devices with varying electrode layouts and counts, using coordinate-based spatial embedding and a spatially-guided transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The heterogeneity of EEG devices hinders the adoption and scaling of EEG foundation models, creating challenges for widespread use in neuroscience and BCI applications.

Method: Uses learnable coordinate-based spatial embedding to map diverse electrode layouts into unified space, processed by a spatially-guided transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependencies.

Result: HEAR substantially outperforms existing EEG foundation models in supporting heterogeneous devices and generalizing across cognitive tasks and subjects.

Conclusion: HEAR successfully addresses EEG device heterogeneity and demonstrates superior generalization capabilities for diverse EEG applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential technique for neuroscience
research and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Recently, large-scale
EEG foundation models have been developed, exhibiting robust generalization
capabilities across diverse tasks and subjects. However, the heterogeneity of
EEG devices not only hinders the widespread adoption of these models but also
poses significant challenges to their further scaling and development. In this
paper, we introduce HEAR, the first EEG foundation model explicitly designed to
support heterogeneous EEG devices, accommodating varying electrode layouts and
electrode counts. HEAR employs a learnable, coordinate-based spatial embedding
to map electrodes with diverse layouts and varying counts into a unified
representational space. This unified spatial representation is then processed
by a novel spatially-guided transformer, which effectively captures
spatiotemporal dependencies across electrodes. To support the development of
HEAR, we construct a large-scale EEG dataset comprising 8,782 hours of data
collected from over 150 distinct electrode layouts with up to 1,132 electrodes.
Experimental results demonstrate that HEAR substantially outperforms existing
EEG foundation models in supporting heterogeneous EEG devices and generalizing
across diverse cognitive tasks and subjects.

TL;DR: Analysis of wireless channel characteristics across multiple domains (delay-Doppler, chirp, time-frequency) and proposal of adaptive transform domain framework for dynamic domain switching based on channel conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in complex propagation environments and next-gen applications by leveraging alternative multiplexing domains that offer additional degrees of freedom for channel modeling and exploitation.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of channel characteristics across domains, evaluation of domain advantages under specific conditions, and proposal of generalized adaptive transform domain framework using DFT matrix pre-/post-processing.

Result: Framework enables dynamic transitions between domains in response to channel conditions and system requirements, with demonstrated applicability in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: Cross-domain waveform processing offers promising approach for next-generation wireless systems, with identified future directions and challenges.

Abstract: The emergence of alternative multiplexing domains to the time-frequency
domains, e.g., the delay-Doppler and chirp domains, offers a promising approach
for addressing the challenges posed by complex propagation environments and
next-generation applications. Unlike the time and frequency domains, these
domains offer unique channel representations which provide additional degrees
of freedom (DoF) for modeling, characterizing, and exploiting wireless channel
features. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of channel
characteristics, including delay, Doppler shifts, and channel coefficients
across various domains, with an emphasis on their inter-domain relationships,
shared characteristics, and domain-specific distinctions. We further evaluate
the comparative advantages of each domain under specific channel conditions.
Building on this analysis, we propose a generalized and adaptive transform
domain framework that leverages the pre- and post-processing of the discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) matrix, to enable dynamic transitions between various
domains in response to the channel conditions and system requirements. Finally,
several representative use cases are presented to demonstrate the applicability
of the proposed cross-domain waveform processing framework in diverse
scenarios, along with future directions and challenges.

*Axel Janson,Joakim Andén*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A Bayesian approach using diffusion models as priors for multi-reference alignment, reducing sample requirements while enabling accurate signal recovery and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frequentist methods require large sample sizes for accurate signal recovery at low SNR, creating a need for more sample-efficient approaches.

Method: Leverage diffusion models as plug-and-play priors conditioned on shift-invariant power spectrum statistics for posterior sampling.

Result: Significantly reduces required number of samples compared to state-of-the-art methods like EM and bispectrum inversion, while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach establishes a promising framework for orbit recovery problems like cryo-EM, demonstrating sample efficiency and uncertainty quantification capabilities.

Abstract: We propose a Bayesian approach to the problem of multi-reference alignment --
the recovery of signals from noisy, randomly shifted observations. While
existing frequentist methods accurately recover the signal at arbitrarily low
signal-to-noise ratios, they require a large number of samples to do so. In
contrast, our proposed method leverages diffusion models as data-driven
plug-and-play priors, conditioning these on the sample power spectrum (a
shift-invariant statistic) enabling both accurate posterior sampling and
uncertainty quantification. The use of an appropriate prior significantly
reduces the required number of samples, as illustrated in simulation
experiments with comparisons to state-of-the-art methods such as
expectation--maximization and bispectrum inversion. These findings establish
our approach as a promising framework for other orbit recovery problems, such
as cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM).

TL;DR: Proposes TMS algorithm for ISAC systems to estimate parameters of spread targets in angle and range domains, with DFT-based range estimation and dynamic beamforming for multi-target illumination and DL user service.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to address integrated sensing and communication for targets spread in both angle and range domains, overcoming limitations of conventional MUSIC spread algorithms.

Method: Truncated MUSIC spread (TMS) algorithm using eigen decomposition for signal subspace rank restriction, DFT-based distance/range spread estimation, and dynamic transmit beamforming for multi-target illumination.

Result: Superior performance over baseline schemes in both low and high SNR regimes, and under wide angular spread conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed TMS and DFT-based algorithms effectively handle spread targets in ISAC systems with improved parameter estimation accuracy and beamforming performance.

Abstract: This work studies an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework
for targets that are spread both in the angle and range domains. We model each
target using a cluster of rays parameterized by a specific density function,
and propose a truncated Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) spread (TMS)
algorithm to accurately estimate the parameters of the density function. Unlike
the conventional MUSIC spread (CMS), TMS restricts the signal subspace rank
based on the eigen decomposition of the received-signal autocorrelation. We
also propose a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based algorithm for estimating
the distance and range spread of each target. Leveraging these estimates, we
then develop a dynamic transmit beamforming algorithm that successfully
illuminates multiple targets while also serving multiple downlink (DL) users.
Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms over
baseline schemes in both low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes as
well as under a wide angular spread regime.

TL;DR: This tutorial introduces a principled framework for brain age gap prediction (BAGP) using graph neural networks and covariance neural networks (VNNs) to address limitations of conventional neurodegeneration assessment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional neurodegeneration assessment methods like cortical thickness and brain volume measurements lack statistical sophistication to capture the spatially correlated and heterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration. BAGP models offer promise but face methodological obscurities and limited generalizability.

Method: Proposes a framework using graph neural networks (GNNs) and covariance neural networks (VNNs) that leverage anatomical covariance matrices from structural MRI data, integrating graph signal processing, machine learning, and network neuroscience approaches.

Result: VNNs provide strong theoretical grounding and operational interpretability for robust estimation of brain age gap predictions, enabling more reliable assessment of brain health biomarkers.

Conclusion: The work clarifies the path forward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research directions in personalized medicine by integrating multiple computational neuroscience perspectives.

Abstract: Neurodegeneration, characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal
structure or function, is commonly assessed in clinical practice through
reductions in cortical thickness or brain volume, as visualized by structural
MRI. While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical
sophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and
heterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy
aging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age
gap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain
age gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's
predicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The
resulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with
recent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and
severity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their
methodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical
populations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces
a principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in
graph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks
(GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the
anatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong
theoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust
estimation of brain age gap predictions. By integrating perspectives from GSP,
machine learning, and network neuroscience, this work clarifies the path
forward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research
directions in personalized medicine.

*Qingwen Li,Xiaohang Zhao,Xiao Han,Hailiang Huang,Lanjuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoDoctor is an interpretable ICU mortality prediction framework that integrates clinical course identification, demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness into its reasoning process, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and clinical interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU mortality prediction requires not only accuracy but also interpretability for clinical trust and regulatory compliance. Current approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity while overlooking clinical course identification and prognostication awareness, creating a gap in comprehensive decision-making alignment.

Method: ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: 1) Prognostic Clinical Course Identification module using prototype learning with novel regularization for prognostication awareness, and 2) Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module using cohort-specific prototypes and risk adjustments.

Result: Extensive empirical evaluations show ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy. Human evaluations confirm its interpretations are more clinically meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

Conclusion: ProtoDoctor successfully delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three key elements of ICU decision-making practices, providing a comprehensive solution for ICU mortality prediction that balances accuracy with clinical interpretability.

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.
The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes
and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.
Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically
meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAR is a Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning framework that jointly trains problem composers and solvers in an adversarial loop, improving training efficiency and performance on formal theorem proving tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for training math problem solvers rely on fixed problem sets, leading to inefficient training and limited ability to handle complex problems. There's a need for more dynamic training methods that can adapt to the prover's evolving capabilities.

Method: GAR introduces an adversarial training loop where a problem composer and solver are jointly trained. The framework creates an implicit curriculum learning mechanism that aligns task difficulty with the prover's current capability level.

Result: Experiments show GAR training improves performance: Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve 4.20% average relative improvement on MiniF2F-Test, and DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%.

Conclusion: GAR establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and solving in verifiable environments, enabling more efficient training and stronger performance on advanced theorem proving tasks.

Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on
ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR
establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and
solving under verifiable environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Janus is a framework for node-level anomaly detection that jointly uses Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary node representations, with contrastive learning to identify anomalous nodes that are difficult to reconcile across spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Node-level anomaly detection is challenging due to diverse structural patterns and feature distributions, and is critical for applications like fraud detection, cybersecurity, and recommendation systems.

Method: Each node is described by two views (original features and structural features from random walks/degrees), embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces using a multi Graph-Autoencoder framework with contrastive learning as regularization.

Result: Experiments on four real-world datasets show Janus consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines.

Conclusion: Combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

Abstract: Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural
patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with
several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to
recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages
Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects
of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the
original features and structural features derived from random walks and
degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi
Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as
regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic
spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus
likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus
consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating
that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and
effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

*Jin Ma,Ying Tan,Renyuan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a soft-constrained Schrödinger bridge problem (SCSBP) that replaces hard terminal constraints with penalty functions, providing more flexible stochastic control for generative AI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical Schrödinger bridge problems enforce hard terminal constraints that cause instability in high-dimensional or data-scarce scenarios, limiting practical implementation in generative modeling.

Method: Proposes soft-constrained Schrödinger bridge problem using penalty functions instead of hard constraints, analyzed through Doob's h-transform, stability of Schrödinger potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument.

Result: Establishes existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and proves linear convergence to classical SBP as penalty increases, providing first quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges.

Conclusion: Soft-constrained bridges enable robust generative modeling, fine-tuning, and transfer learning through penalty regularization, offering practical advantages over classical hard-constrained approaches.

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A highly efficient zeroth-order method for estimating training data influence that uses only loss values and checkpoints, avoiding expensive gradient/Hessian computations while achieving superior accuracy for self-influence estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how individual training examples influence model behavior is critical for data selection and model debugging, but existing methods are impractical for large models due to computational costs and poor approximations.

Method: Zeroth-order approximation using only loss values of intermediate checkpoints on training and test data, along with the checkpoints themselves, avoiding gradient and inverse-Hessian computations.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable/improved accuracy for train-test influence estimation, with significantly reduced time and memory requirements compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: Enables scalable and practical analysis of how training data shapes model behavior, particularly effective for fine-tuned large language models and applicable even with non-differentiable loss functions.

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data
shapes model behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Boundary Guidance is a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that steers generation away from classifier decision boundaries to improve both safety and utility of outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning approaches push models toward classifier decision boundaries, increasing false positives and false negatives, which compromises both safety and utility.

Method: Proposed Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly steers generation away from the classifier's margin.

Result: On jailbreak and ambiguous prompt benchmarks, Boundary Guidance improves both safety and utility of outputs according to LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates robustness across model scales and reward designs, offering a more effective alternative to traditional safety fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

TL;DR: WaveletDiff is a novel diffusion model framework that trains on wavelet coefficients to generate high-quality synthetic time series data, outperforming existing methods across multiple domains and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large, high-quality time series datasets are scarce, and current synthetic generation models struggle with the multi-scaled structure of real-world time series data.

Method: Trains diffusion models directly on wavelet coefficients using dedicated transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms and adaptive gating, incorporating energy preservation constraints based on Parseval's theorem.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods across six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains, achieving discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are 3× smaller on average than the second-best baseline.

Conclusion: WaveletDiff effectively addresses the limitations of existing time series generation methods by leveraging wavelet-based multi-resolution analysis and achieves superior performance in generating realistic synthetic time series data.

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a fundamental trade-off in adapting language models to new tasks: learning new capabilities while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. The optimal replay ratios for balancing task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain poorly understood.

Method: The authors conducted a comprehensive empirical study using bAbI reasoning tasks as the target objective. They applied synthetic data generation and systematically evaluated different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations, analyzing effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention.

Result: The experiments revealed an optimal configuration that balances task-specific performance with general knowledge retention. The findings provide empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on computational budget.

Conclusion: Practitioners can achieve strong task adaptation with significantly reduced training costs by following the provided guidelines for replay ratio selection based on computational budget.

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advances in open-source VLMs offer opportunities to understand complex multimodal phenomena like sarcasm, which requires detecting visual-textual incongruities.

Method: Evaluated 7 VLMs (BLIP2, InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, Qwen-VL) on sarcasm detection and explanation generation using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting across three datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, SarcNet).

Result: Current models achieve moderate success in binary sarcasm detection but struggle to generate high-quality explanations without task-specific finetuning.

Conclusion: While VLMs show promise for multimodal sarcasm detection, they require further development and finetuning to generate human-quality explanations that highlight visual-textual incongruities.

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.
Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in
binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality
explanations without task-specific finetuning.

TL;DR: Incorporating actor behavior as time-varying signals improves throughput time prediction in process monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Processes are resource-driven and understanding actor behavior is crucial for accurate forecasting, but current approaches don't fully utilize actor behavior as time-varying signals.

Method: Constructed multivariate time series with throughput time and actor-centric features (involvement, frequency of behaviors, durations), then trained and compared multiple models.

Result: Actor-enriched models consistently outperformed baseline models (only TT features) across RMSE, MAE, and R2 metrics.

Conclusion: Modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating it into forecasting models enhances performance indicator predictions.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

### [113] [Improving Knowledge Graph Embeddings through Contrastive Learning with Negative Statements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11868)
*Rita T. Sousa,Heiko Paulheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel dual-model embedding approach that integrates explicitly declared negative statements into knowledge graph embedding learning, improving predictive performance over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing knowledge graph embedding methods rely on Closed World assumptions, treating missing triples as false, which contrasts with real-world Open World assumptions. Explicit negative statements are rarely included and overlooked during training.

Method: Uses a dual-model architecture with two embedding models trained in parallel - one on positive statements and another on negative statements. Each model generates negative samples by corrupting positive samples and selecting most likely candidates as scored by the other model.

Result: Extensive experiments on general-purpose and domain-specific knowledge graphs show improved predictive performance in link prediction and triple classification tasks over state-of-the-art embedding models.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge into embedding learning, enhancing model performance by better distinguishing between false and unknown triples.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

*Xiaohang Tang,Zhuowen Cheng,Satyabrat Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CART is the first framework to enhance adversarial robustness of Decision Transformers in stochastic games by formulating stage games with NashQ values, achieving better worst-case performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods based on sequence modeling like Decision Transformer remains largely unexplored, particularly in adversarial stochastic games.

Method: Formulates interaction between protagonist and adversary as stage games with payoffs defined as expected maximum value over subsequent states, then conditions Transformer policies on NashQ values derived from these stage games.

Result: CART achieves more accurate minimax value estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range of adversarial stochastic games.

Conclusion: CART successfully enhances Decision Transformer robustness by explicitly incorporating stochastic transitions and Nash equilibrium concepts, producing policies that are both adversarially robust and conservative to transition uncertainty.

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaRL is a bi-level optimization framework that uses adaptive low-rank policy representations to improve robustness in reinforcement learning without nested min-max optimization, achieving better performance than existing methods while converging to task-intrinsic ranks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust RL methods rely on computationally expensive nested min-max optimization and produce overly conservative policies. There's a need for more efficient approaches that avoid over-parameterization while maintaining robustness under model uncertainty.

Method: Bi-level optimization with lower-level policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints using dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball, and upper-level adaptive rank adjustment to balance bias-variance trade-off by projecting policy parameters onto low-rank manifolds.

Result: AdaRL consistently outperforms fixed-rank baselines (SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (RNAC, Parseval) on MuJoCo continuous control benchmarks, while converging toward the intrinsic rank of underlying tasks.

Conclusion: Adaptive low-rank policy representations provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model uncertainty, avoiding adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness without over-parameterization.

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model
uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces unified datasets and formalization for modeling both personal and relational user events together, showing performance benefits over separate modeling approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods model personal events (sequence-based) and relational events (graph-based) separately, but real-world systems need to capture both types together. There's a lack of public datasets and tasks that incorporate both event types.

Method: The authors introduce a collection of datasets that include both personal and relational events, propose a unified formalization for joint modeling, and empirically test models that incorporate both event types.

Result: Models that incorporate both personal and relational events show performance benefits compared to separate modeling approaches. However, current methods still leave significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: Unified modeling of personal and relational events is beneficial and necessary. The released datasets and resources aim to encourage further research in this direction to address current limitations.

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

TL;DR: VMoGE is a variational mixture of graph neural experts that improves dementia diagnosis and staging by integrating frequency-specific biomarker identification with structured variational inference, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG-based methods for dementia diagnosis are limited by full-band frequency analysis, which hinders precise differentiation of dementia subtypes (AD vs FTD) and severity stages due to overlapping electrophysiological signatures.

Method: VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale temporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph convolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. It uses structured variational inference and adaptive gating to link neural specialization to physiologically meaningful EEG frequency bands.

Result: VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over state-of-the-art methods on two diverse datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging. It also provides interpretable insights through expert weights correlating with clinical indicators and spatial patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures.

Conclusion: VMoGE facilitates EEG biomarker discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring by providing enhanced diagnostic accuracy and interpretable insights into frequency-specific neural patterns relevant to different dementia subtypes and severity stages.

Abstract: Dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) exhibit overlapping electrophysiological signatures in EEG that

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Locaris is a decoder-only LLM for indoor Wi-Fi positioning that treats AP measurements as tokens, enabling direct processing of raw Wi-Fi signals without pre-processing and achieving sub-meter accuracy with minimal calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Wi-Fi positioning methods require labor-intensive calibration and suffer performance degradation when devices, channel conditions, or deployment scenarios change, making them impractical for large-scale real-world deployments.

Method: Fine-tune a decoder-only large language model (LLM) on Wi-Fi datasets, treating each access point measurement as a token to learn a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to device location.

Result: Locaris matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods across various telemetry types, achieves sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, maintains robust performance under missing APs, and supports all available telemetry with few-shot adaptation to new devices and scenarios.

Conclusion: Compact LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization, offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous Wi-Fi deployments, making them practically viable for large-scale real-world scenarios where extensive calibration is infeasible.

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

TL;DR: Proposes three efficient restart paradigms (partial, adaptive, selective) for model-free non-stationary RL to address issues of complete forgetting and scheduled restarts in existing algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in RestartQ-UCB algorithm: complete forgetting of learned information after restarts and rigid scheduled restarts that don't adapt to environment changes.

Method: Introduces three restart approaches: partial restarts (preserve some knowledge), adaptive restarts (trigger based on environment changes), and selective restarts (choose what to forget). Applied to RestartQ-UCB and RANDOMIZEDQ algorithms.

Result: Achieved near-optimal empirical performance across multiple environments, reducing dynamic regret by up to 91% compared to RestartQ-UCB.

Conclusion: The proposed restart paradigms effectively address the identified limitations and significantly improve performance in non-stationary RL settings.

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%
relative to RestartQ-UCB.

TL;DR: Efficient Turing computability implies existence of compositionally sparse DAG representations and neural approximants achieving target precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish connections between computational complexity theory and neural network approximation theory, showing that efficiently computable functions can be approximated by sparse neural networks.

Method: Show that if a function is computable in polynomial time in bit-depths, then there exist bounded-fan-in Boolean circuits of polynomial size computing discretized versions, which can be converted to deep neural networks by replacing gates with constant-size neural emulators.

Result: For every pair of precisions, there exists a deep neural network of polynomial size and depth that achieves accuracy ε=2^{-m_out} for efficiently computable functions.

Conclusion: Efficient computability guarantees the existence of sparse neural approximants, relating computational complexity to neural network approximation rates and optimization over sparse structures.

Abstract: We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output
precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse}
(bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding
neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if
$f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for
every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mathrm{out}})$ there exists a bounded-fan-in
Boolean circuit of size and depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ computing the
discretized map; replacing each gate by a constant-size neural emulator yields
a deep network of size/depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ that achieves accuracy
$\varepsilon=2^{-m_{\mathrm{out}}}$. We also relate these constructions to
compositional approximation rates
\cite{MhaskarPoggio2016b,poggio_deep_shallow_2017,Poggio2017,Poggio2023HowDS}
and to optimization viewed as hierarchical search over sparse structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that KL divergence in VAEs fails to enforce disentangled representations and introduces a new Programmable Prior Framework using MMD that achieves state-of-the-art disentanglement without reconstruction trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VAE approaches using KL divergence penalty are unreliable for learning disentangled representations, as they fail to enforce the target distribution on the aggregate posterior.

Method: Introduces Programmable Prior Framework based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) that allows explicit control over latent space structure, with validation using novel Latent Predictability Score (LPS).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art mutual independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without reconstruction quality trade-offs, enabling engineering of sophisticated priors for better semantic alignment.

Conclusion: Provides a foundational tool for representation engineering that enables better model identifiability and opens new avenues for causal reasoning through programmable latent spaces.

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern continuous-time generative models use V-shaped transport where samples travel independently along straight trajectories, overlooking shared structure in data.

Method: Formulates Y-shaped generative flows based on novel velocity-powered transport cost with sublinear exponent (0-1), instantiated in scalable neural ODE training objective.

Result: On synthetic, image, and biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve distributional metrics over flow-based baselines, and reach targets with fewer integration steps.

Conclusion: Y-shaped flows effectively capture shared structure through joint mass movement along shared pathways before branching, outperforming traditional V-shaped transport approaches.

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

TL;DR: MosaicDiff is a novel framework that aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration through trajectory-aware structural pruning, achieving significant speed-ups without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior diffusion acceleration methods have overlooked the distinct phases of learning speed during pretraining, which exhibit different characteristics that should inform pruning strategies.

Method: Uses adaptive structural pruning that mirrors diffusion pretraining dynamics: conservative pruning for fast-learning middle stages and aggressive pruning for slow-learning early/later stages.

Result: Achieves significant sampling speed-ups on DiT and SDXL models while maintaining output quality, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins.

Conclusion: Provides a new viewpoint for efficient training-free diffusion acceleration by harmonizing model's inner training dynamics with accelerated sampling process.

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformer interpretation methods lack mathematical frameworks for mechanistically modeling layer transitions, inspiring a cross-disciplinary approach using quantum mechanics principles.

Method: Convert Transformer latent activations into state vectors in Hilbert space, reformulate hidden layers as unitary operators and Hamiltonians, apply Born rule for final probability distribution.

Result: Proof-of-concept demonstration on toy Transformer shows QLENS can probe individual layer influence in prediction trajectories.

Conclusion: QLENS provides foundation for cross-domain insights and broader understanding of Transformers through quantum mechanics framework.

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

TL;DR: CW-DPO is a two-stage alignment method that stabilizes VLM training by using gentle negatives in SFT and cooling-weighted DPO to suppress uninformative gradients while preserving hard negatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preference-based finetuning of VLMs is brittle due to trivially wrong negatives injecting uninformative gradients that destabilize training.

Method: Two-stage approach: Stage 1 uses gentle negatives in supervised finetuning for regularization; Stage 2 applies DPO with cooling-weighted negative term scaling based on average token log-probability on negatives.

Result: CW-DPO yields more stable optimization, better calibration, higher pairwise win-rates than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while converging in fewer steps across diverse VLM tasks.

Conclusion: Smoothing learning dynamics before cooling preferences is a simple, general principle for robust VLM alignment.

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between biological neural networks and deep learning by developing a biologically plausible learning method that doesn't rely on backpropagation, addressing how nature achieves robust, sample-efficient learning at minimal energy costs.

Method: Uses statistical mechanics to analyze neural dynamics in asymmetric recurrent networks, identifies phase transitions in fixed point structures, and proposes a supervised learning algorithm where inputs are mapped to fixed points via local plasticity and transient external stimuli.

Result: The algorithm successfully learns an entangled version of MNIST, leverages network depth for hierarchical representations, increases hetero-association capacity, and shows strong connection between performance and the identified phase transition in network dynamics.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that biologically plausible learning mechanisms based on neural dynamics and local plasticity can achieve competitive performance on machine learning tasks, offering a promising alternative to backpropagation and insights into how biological systems might solve credit assignment.

Abstract: Despite the striking successes of deep neural networks trained with
gradient-based optimization, these methods differ fundamentally from their
biological counterparts. This gap raises key questions about how nature
achieves robust, sample-efficient learning at minimal energy costs and solves
the credit-assignment problem without backpropagation. We take a step toward
bridging contemporary AI and computational neuroscience by studying how neural
dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning that scales to simple
machine-learning benchmarks. Using tools from statistical mechanics, we
identify conditions for the emergence of robust dynamical attractors in random
asymmetric recurrent networks. We derive a closed-form expression for the
number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling strength, and we reveal a
phase transition in their structure: below a critical self-coupling, isolated
fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters showing the
overlap-gap property; above it, subdominant yet dense and extensive clusters
appear. These fixed points become accessible, including to a simple
asynchronous dynamical rule, after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling
threshold. Building on this analysis, we propose a biologically plausible
algorithm for supervised learning with any binary recurrent network. Inputs are
mapped to fixed points of the dynamics, by relaxing under transient external
stimuli and stabilizing the resulting configurations via local plasticity. We
show that our algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages
depth to develop hierarchical representations and increase hetero-association
capacity, and is applicable to several architectures. Finally, we highlight the
strong connection between algorithm performance and the unveiled phase
transition, and we suggest a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for
its emergence.

*Conor Rowan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exact second-order methods fail in neural network training despite theoretical advantages, challenging conventional wisdom about loss landscapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why exact second-order methods (using true Hessian) fail in neural network training while quasi-Newton methods succeed, and to gain insights into neural network loss landscape geometry.

Method: Analyzed neural network training using exact second-order optimization methods with true Hessian matrix instead of approximations, comparing with quasi-Newton approaches.

Result: Neural network training reliably fails when using exact curvature information from the true Hessian, contrary to expectations that exact methods should outperform approximations.

Conclusion: The failure of exact second-order methods provides new insights into neural network geometry and challenges the conventional view that loss landscapes contain many local minima.

Abstract: Second-order methods are emerging as promising alternatives to standard
first-order optimizers such as gradient descent and ADAM for training neural
networks. Though the advantages of including curvature information in computing
optimization steps have been celebrated in the scientific machine learning
literature, the only second-order methods that have been studied are
quasi-Newton, meaning that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is
approximated. Though one would expect only to gain from using the true Hessian
in place of its approximation, we show that neural network training reliably
fails when relying on exact curvature information. The failure modes provide
insight both into the geometry of nonlinear discretizations as well as the
distribution of stationary points in the loss landscape, leading us to question
the conventional wisdom that the loss landscape is replete with local minima.

*Junsoo Oh,Wei Huang,Taiji Suzuki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mamba achieves efficient in-context learning for single-index models through test-time feature extraction, outperforming linear Transformers and matching nonlinear Transformers while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite Mamba's strong empirical performance and computational efficiency, there's limited theoretical understanding of its underlying mechanisms, particularly for in-context learning capabilities.

Method: Theoretical analysis of Mamba's in-context learning for single-index models, proving that gradient-based pretrained Mamba can extract relevant features directly from context examples during test time.

Result: Mamba achieves test-time sample complexity that improves upon linear Transformers (which behave like kernel methods) and is comparable to nonlinear Transformers, surpassing the CSQ lower bound and approaching information-theoretically optimal rates.

Conclusion: Mamba's nonlinear gating mechanism is crucial for feature extraction, enabling both computational efficiency and high performance in in-context learning tasks.

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},
\boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

*Yi-Chung Chen,David I. Inouye,Jing Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel generative classifier using visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling as an efficient alternative to diffusion-based methods, achieving better accuracy-speed trade-off and offering unique properties like explainability and resistance to catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative classifiers are dominated by diffusion-based models which are computationally expensive and limit scalability. This restricts understanding of generative classifiers and their practical applications.

Method: Develops Adaptive VAR Classifier+ (A-VARC+) based on visual autoregressive modeling, which provides tractable likelihood and enables efficient inference while maintaining classification performance.

Result: A-VARC+ achieves superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed compared to diffusion-based methods. It also enables visual explainability through token-wise mutual information and shows inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning.

Conclusion: VAR-based generative classifiers offer a practical and efficient alternative to diffusion-based methods with unique advantages including explainability and robustness to catastrophic forgetting, expanding the understanding and applicability of generative classifiers.

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

*Sangmin Jo,Jee Seok Yoon,Wootaek Jeong,Kwanseok Oh,Heung-Il Suk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MEASURE framework for domain generalization in sleep staging, addressing domain-relevant information while preserving temporal/spectral features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning sleep staging models struggle with generalization on unseen subjects due to domain variability. Existing contrastive learning methods fail to adequately extract domain-invariant representations.

Method: MEASURE (Multi-scalE minImal SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and spectral features across multiple feature levels.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art methods on SleepEDF-20 and MASS benchmark datasets in exhaustive experiments.

Conclusion: Effectively bridges domain gap in sleep staging by mitigating domain-relevant attributes while maintaining diverse temporal and spectral information.

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stagewise data attribution framework that shows neural network influence patterns change dynamically across learning stages, including sign flips and peaks at transitions, validated in toy models and language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TDA methods treat influence as static, but neural networks learn in distinct stages with changing influence patterns that need dynamic analysis.

Method: Developed a stagewise data attribution framework based on singular learning theory, validated analytically and empirically in toy models and scaled to language models.

Result: Showed influence changes non-monotonically with sign flips and sharp peaks at developmental transitions, mapping to progressive learning of semantic hierarchy in toy models and aligning with known developmental stages in language models.

Conclusion: Influence patterns in neural networks are dynamic and stage-dependent, requiring stagewise analysis rather than static attribution methods.

Abstract: Current training data attribution (TDA) methods treat the influence one
sample has on another as static, but neural networks learn in distinct stages
that exhibit changing patterns of influence. In this work, we introduce a
framework for stagewise data attribution grounded in singular learning theory.
We predict that influence can change non-monotonically, including sign flips
and sharp peaks at developmental transitions. We first validate these
predictions analytically and empirically in a toy model, showing that dynamic
shifts in influence directly map to the model's progressive learning of a
semantic hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate these phenomena at scale in
language models, where token-level influence changes align with known
developmental stages.

*Heng Zhang,Tianyi Zhang,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Yaomin Shen,Haochen You,Zijian Zhang,Yilei Yuan,Jin Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphShaper is a geometry-aware framework that addresses performance degradation at structural boundaries in graph foundation models by using multi-geometric specialization and adaptive fusion of geometric properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph foundation models using large language models suffer from significant performance degradation at structural boundaries where different topological patterns converge, due to the limitation of encoding all graph structures in a single Euclidean space.

Method: GraphShaper employs expert networks tailored to different geometric spaces (Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical) and dynamically computes fusion weights to adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural characteristics before alignment with text embeddings.

Result: GraphShaper achieves 9.47% accuracy improvements on citation networks and 7.63% on social networks in zero-shot settings compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses geometric diversity in graph structures through multi-geometric specialization and adaptive fusion, significantly improving performance at structural boundaries.

Abstract: Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning
transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods
leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared
representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic
evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries
where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20
percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods
assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In
reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical
branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure
properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric
constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial
challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the
intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce
\textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding
through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks
tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to
adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural
characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before
alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and
7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: H4G addresses over-abstraction in graph-text alignment by reducing hyperbolic embedding radii to preserve fine-grained structural patterns, achieving significant improvements in zero-shot learning on both heterophilic and homophilic graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for zero-shot learning on text-attributed graphs struggle with fine-grained pattern recognition, especially on heterophilic graphs, due to over-abstraction that compresses multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions.

Method: Proposes H4G framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable block-diagonal scaling matrices and Möbius matrix multiplication to restore access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global receptive ability.

Result: H4G achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with 12.8% improvement on heterophilic graphs and 8.4% on homophilic graphs, demonstrating that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation.

Conclusion: Reducing hyperbolic embedding radii is essential for faithful preservation of fine-grained structural details, advancing zero-shot graph learning by addressing the over-abstraction problem in current approaches.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

TL;DR: Dynamic sparse training strategies provide module-specific benefits that complement architectural improvements in deep reinforcement learning, leading to the proposed Module-Specific Training (MST) framework for substantial scalability gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling neural networks fails in DRL due to optimization pathologies like plasticity loss, and existing dynamic training approaches have limitations including uniform strategies across modules, limited evaluation scope, and lack of systematic comparison between different dynamic approaches.

Method: Comprehensive investigation across modules and architectures, comparing different dynamic approaches (sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, sparse-to-dense), and developing Module-Specific Training (MST) framework that exploits architectural improvements without algorithmic modifications.

Result: Dynamic sparse training strategies provide module-specific benefits that complement architectural improvements, and MST demonstrates substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms.

Conclusion: Module-Specific Training (MST) effectively addresses scalability limitations in DRL by combining dynamic sparse training with architectural improvements, achieving significant performance gains without requiring algorithmic changes.

Abstract: Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning,
yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger
models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as
plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network
topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three
critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across
all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning
paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying
the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and
architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between
different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and
sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and
architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide
module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation
established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights
into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further
exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates
substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic
modifications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chimera is a unified transformer model that incorporates data topology directly, eliminating the need for domain-specific biases like position embeddings. It achieves strong performance across language, vision, and graph domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer methods ignore neighborhood structure and graph topology, requiring task-specific inductive biases that require significant effort to design and can hinder generalization.

Method: Generalize state space models to capture any graph topology, with algorithmic optimizations for Directed Acyclic Graphs (linear-time recurrence) and general graphs (mathematical relaxation to quadratic complexity).

Result: Outperforms BERT on GLUE by 0.7 points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph Benchmark.

Conclusion: Data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities, and Chimera provides a principled way to incorporate it without domain-specific heuristics.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: nuGPR is a new Gaussian Process Regression framework that reduces computation costs through numerical linear algebra techniques, preconditioned conjugate gradient, data clustering for block-diagonal structure, low-rank approximations, numerical gradients, and GPU parallelization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computation cost challenge in Gaussian Process Regression training, which limits its practical applications despite its inherent uncertainty measurement capabilities.

Method: Uses preconditioned conjugate gradient for linear solves, exploits data clustering to identify block-diagonal covariance structure with low-rank off-diagonal approximations, employs numerical gradients instead of exact differentiation, and leverages CUDA for GPU parallelization.

Result: Reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up to 12x compared to existing GPU-based GPR implementations on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: nuGPR provides an efficient end-to-end training algorithm that significantly improves the computational efficiency of Gaussian Process Regression while maintaining its uncertainty quantification capabilities.

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRACE is a graph few-shot learning framework that addresses limitations of fixed graph filters and distribution mismatches between support and query sets through adaptive spectrum experts and cross-set distribution calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph few-shot learning methods use predefined graph filters that don't account for local topological heterogeneity, and assume support and query sets share the same distribution, which leads to suboptimal generalization with limited labeled data.

Method: GRACE integrates adaptive spectrum experts to handle local structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration techniques to address distribution mismatches between support and query sets.

Result: The framework theoretically enhances model generalization and empirically outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various experimental settings.

Conclusion: GRACE effectively addresses key limitations in graph few-shot learning by adapting to local structural variations and calibrating cross-set distributions, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

*Harsh Kasyap,Minghong Fang,Zhuqing Liu,Carsten Maple,Somanath Tripathy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an intentional fairness attack in federated learning where a malicious client sends biased models that increase fairness loss while maintaining global accuracy, making the attack hard to detect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning enables privacy-preserving collaboration but is susceptible to poisoning attacks and bias propagation due to different data distributions or historical biases. The paper aims to demonstrate how malicious clients can intentionally introduce bias.

Method: The attack involves a client maliciously sending a biased model by increasing fairness loss during training, even with homogeneous data distribution. Fairness loss is calculated by solving optimization problems for metrics like demographic parity and equalized odds.

Result: The attack successfully increases bias up to 90% even with just one malicious client, while maintaining global accuracy. It remains effective against state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes across different datasets and settings.

Conclusion: The proposed fairness attack is insidious and hard to detect, highlighting significant vulnerabilities in federated learning systems despite existing defense mechanisms, emphasizing the need for stronger security measures against such intentional bias attacks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

*Ali Parsaee,Bei Jiang,Zachary Friggstad,Russell Greiner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores budgeted learning for survival datasets with censored instances, where learners can pay to acquire partial or full labels for censored data points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised learning assumes fully labeled datasets, but real-world survival data often contains censored instances where only partial information is available. Budgeted learning allows strategic allocation of resources to acquire additional labels.

Method: The approach applies state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data, allowing learners to pay for partial labeling of censored instances (e.g., acquiring actual time-to-event or additional time information).

Result: The method provides bounds and time complexity asymptotically equivalent to BatchBALD. Empirical analysis shows superior performance compared to other approaches on multiple survival benchmarks.

Conclusion: Budgeted learning can be effectively applied to survival datasets with censored instances, providing a realistic model for real-world data collection where follow-up doesn't always lead to complete uncensoring.

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

TL;DR: Self-verifying reflection improves reasoning in small transformers for tasks like integer multiplication and Sudoku, achieving LLM-level performance without natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reflection contributes to empirical improvements in reasoning, given that LLMs detect limited errors in chain-of-thoughts.

Method: A minimalistic reasoning framework supporting basic self-verifying reflection for small transformers without natural language, with theoretical analysis and experimental validation.

Result: Tiny transformers benefit from self-verification in training and execution, reaching LLM-level performance. RL improves in-distribution performance but mainly optimizes shallow patterns without reducing verification errors.

Conclusion: Integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently facilitates chain-of-thought reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

### [141] [Revisiting Meta-Learning with Noisy Labels: Reweighting Dynamics and Theoretical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12209)
*Yiming Zhang,Chester Holtz,Gal Mishne,Alex Cloninger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting for learning with noisy labels, revealing three training phases and proposing a lightweight surrogate method that outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-learning-based sample reweighting helps mitigate label noise but lacks theoretical understanding of its behavior and training dynamics.

Method: Rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting training dynamics, followed by proposing a lightweight surrogate method with mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation to avoid expensive bi-level optimization.

Result: The analysis reveals three training phases: alignment, filtering, and post-filtering. The proposed surrogate method consistently outperforms strong reweighting/selection baselines across synthetic and real noisy-label benchmarks.

Conclusion: Meta-reweighting's effectiveness stems from similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals, but loses discriminatory power in post-filtering phase. The lightweight surrogate provides more stable performance without expensive optimization.

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized
networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting
mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its
behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show
that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase
that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses
conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward
zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in
which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a
similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together
with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where
the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and
meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we
propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates
mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable
performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic
and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong
reweighting/selection baselines.

*Tao Xie,Zexi Tan,Haoyi Xiao,Binbin Sun,Yiqun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DE3S is a novel framework for medical early time-series classification that addresses the accuracy-earliness trade-off through dual-enhancement shapelet learning, soft shapelet sparsification, and dual-path architecture with MoE and Inception modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early time-series classification in medical applications like sepsis prediction is crucial for timely interventions, but faces challenges of accuracy-earliness trade-off, weak early signals, and class imbalance that existing methods struggle to balance.

Method: Proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning (DE3S) with three innovations: 1) dual-enhancement strategy combining temporal augmentation and attention-based global enhancement, 2) attention-score-based soft shapelet sparsification, and 3) dual-path MoE and Inception modules fusion architecture.

Result: Extensive experiments on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies confirming the efficacy of each component in the framework.

Conclusion: DE3S effectively addresses the accuracy-earliness trade-off in medical early time-series classification through precise shapelet discovery and robust representation learning, demonstrating superior performance on challenging medical datasets.

Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial
for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units
(ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC
can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare
precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with
existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle
early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key
to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative
subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series
classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning
for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel
Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely
through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy
combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal
enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based
soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative
patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,
and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules
fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and
multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The
framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and
demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments
on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

*Hanru Bai,Weiyang Ding,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion enables one-step image generation while maintaining interpretable generative trajectories through Koopman operator theory and hierarchical architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the trade-off between fast sampling and interpretability in diffusion models, where traditional methods are slow but interpretable, while one-step methods are fast but sacrifice control and interpretability.

Method: Lifts nonlinear diffusion dynamics into a latent space using Koopman operator theory, enabling globally linear evolution and closed-form solutions. Uses hierarchical architecture with scale-specific Koopman subspaces to disentangle generative dynamics across spatial resolutions.

Result: Achieves competitive one-step generation performance while providing full access to intermediate states for manual intervention and interpretable generative trajectories through spectral analysis.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between fast sampling and interpretability in diffusion models, enabling explainable image synthesis with both efficient one-step generation and fine-grained control over the generative process.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

*Bowen Fan,Zhilin Guo,Xunkai Li,Yihan Zhou,Bing Zhou,Zhenjun Li,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IMDGA is a novel human-centric adversarial attack framework that orchestrates multi-level perturbations across both graph structure and textual features in Graph-LLMs, demonstrating superior interpretability, effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks on both structural topology and textual attributes, but no existing work has unified these attack dimensions into a comprehensive approach.

Method: IMDGA uses three tightly integrated modules to craft multi-level perturbations across graph structure and textual features, balancing interpretability and impact.

Result: Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, IMDGA shows superior interpretability, attack effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods across diverse datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: IMDGA exposes critical semantic vulnerabilities in Graph-LLMs and provides valuable insights for improving their resilience, revealing a previously underexplored dimension of vulnerability.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack
effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By
exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers
a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,
offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and

### [145] [MoRA: On-the-fly Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation Framework for LLM-based Multi-Modal Molecular Assistant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12245)
*Tao Yin,Xiaohong Zhang,Jiacheng Zhang,Li Huang,Zhibin Zhang,Yuansong Zeng,Jin Xie,Meng Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoRA introduces instance-specific parameter adaptation for molecular graphs in LLMs, avoiding static alignment limitations and catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use shared parameter spaces across all molecular inputs, limiting instance-specific feature capture and causing catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning LLMs.

Method: Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA) generates unique low-rank adaptation weights for each input molecular graph, dynamically injecting them into frozen LLMs.

Result: MoRA outperforms static baselines with 14.1% relative improvement in reaction prediction exact match and 22% error reduction in quantum property prediction.

Conclusion: Instance-specific dynamic adaptation effectively integrates molecular structures with LLMs while preserving core model knowledge.

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

### [146] [Optimal Regularization for Performative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12249)
*Edwige Cyffers,Alireza Mirrokni,Marco Mondelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Regularization helps manage performative effects in high-dimensional ridge regression, where data distribution reacts to the deployed model. Performative effects can be beneficial in over-parameterized regimes, and optimal regularization scales with the strength of these effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In performative learning, data distribution changes in response to deployed models (e.g., strategic user adaptation), creating more complex dynamics than classical supervised learning. Models need to account for potential distribution shifts they might cause.

Method: Study regularization's impact in high-dimensional ridge regression with performative effects. Analyze both population setting and over-parameterized regime where features exceed samples.

Result: Performative effects worsen test risk in population setting but can be beneficial in over-parameterized regime. Optimal regularization parameter scales with the overall strength of performative effects.

Conclusion: Regularization can effectively cope with performative effects, and the optimal regularization can be set in anticipation of these effects. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets support these findings.

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: Comprehensive organization of diffusion-based RL field with identified applications across diverse domains and maintained GitHub repository for community resources.

Conclusion: Identifies promising future development directions and maintains active repository to advance the field of diffusion-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key
advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal
expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey
delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We
first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then
introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are
integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.
We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal
dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play
within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize
the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively
maintaining a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ChangfuXu/D4RL-FTD) for
papers and other related resources to apply DMs for RL.

*Ziyi Han,Huanyu Wang,Zeyu Zhang,Xiangxiang Dai,Xutong Liu,John C. S. Lui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiLoRA is a training-free framework that performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools using rank-one components (ROCs) for domain generalization in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA adaptation methods require explicit task labels or additional training, and activate fixed numbers of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy or insufficiency that degrades performance.

Method: HiLoRA defines rank-one components (ROCs) where each rank parameter is an independent unit. It adaptively selects LoRAs and determines ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at sequence level, then refines routing by activating only the most informative ROCs at token level.

Result: HiLoRA achieves substantial improvements in domain generalization with accuracy gains up to 55% over state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining comparable inference throughput.

Conclusion: HiLoRA provides an effective training-free framework for domain generalization through adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools, with theoretical guarantees for selecting relevant LoRAs.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends self-improvement in Neural Combinatorial Optimization to multi-agent actions with joint predictions and set-prediction loss, improving efficiency and coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-improvement methods are computationally expensive and fail to exploit multi-agent coordination structures and agent-permutation symmetries in combinatorial problems.

Method: Proposes joint multi-agent action prediction with set-prediction loss that supervises on multiple expert assignments per state to leverage symmetries.

Result: Demonstrates improved solution quality and reduced generation latency across several combinatorial problems compared to standard self-improvement.

Conclusion: Multi-agent self-improvement with joint action prediction and symmetry-aware losses enhances coordination learning and computational efficiency in NCO.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural
Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their
policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong
empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is
computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous
candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More
fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial
problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in
min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action
trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct
sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and
the ability to learn coordinated behavior.
  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over
joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task
assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,
we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert
assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and
the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating
multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution
generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our
method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements
in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared
to standard self-improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes GFF-PIELM, a Fourier feature-enhanced physics-informed extreme learning machine that effectively handles high-frequency and variable-frequency PDEs while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional PIELM struggles with solving PDEs involving high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors, limiting its applicability to complex physical problems.

Method: Integrates Fourier feature mappings as activation functions in ELM, assigns frequency coefficients to hidden neurons, and develops an innovative initialization method based on ELM output weight distribution.

Result: Significantly improves predictive accuracy for high-frequency, variable-frequency, multi-scale, and inverse problems without increasing training time or architecture complexity.

Conclusion: PIELM can be successfully extended to solve challenging high-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and the initialization strategy may inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning frameworks.

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

TL;DR: Safe policy improvement (SPI) extended to online settings with world models and representation learning, ensuring monotonic improvement through restricted policy updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SPI guarantees are limited to offline, tabular RL settings, creating a need to extend these theoretical controls to general online settings with deep learning components.

Method: Developed DeepSPI algorithm that couples local transition and reward losses with regularized policy updates, restricting updates to a neighborhood of current policy.

Result: On ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines like PPO and DeepMDPs while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: The framework successfully extends SPI to online deep RL settings, linking prediction losses to representation quality and providing theoretical foundations for safe policy improvement.

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate rainfall forecasting, especially for extreme events, is challenging in climatology and Earth systems. Current models struggle with capturing complex spatiotemporal patterns and predicting extremes effectively.

Method: Combines physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with extreme-value analysis. Uses graph-structured representation of gauge stations with Graph Attention Network and LSTM layers, incorporating orographic-precipitation physics. Applies Peak-Over-Threshold mapping with Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto Distribution method.

Conclusion: The method provides practical enhancement for fine-resolution rainfall maps, supporting decision-making in long-term water management through improved extreme-event forecasting.

Abstract: Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a
significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents
novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value
analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across
Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge
stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers
explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices
that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention
Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention
mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple
orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently
processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold
(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto
Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional
machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to
extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared
with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application
improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce
fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water
management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many practical RL algorithms use evolving reward functions (reward shaping, entropy regularization, curriculum learning) but lack theoretical foundations.

Method: Analyze single-timescale actor-critic algorithm with reward parameters changing at each time step, affecting both policy optimization and value estimation, under Markovian sampling.

Result: Derived non-asymptotic bounds showing O(1/√T) convergence rate achievable when reward parameters evolve slowly enough, matching best static reward rate.

reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

*Donghwan Rho,Sieun Seo,Hyewon Sung,Chohong Min,Ernest K. Ryu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes TSP-based token reordering and post-processing for encrypted text generation using homomorphic encryption, enabling privacy-preserving LLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As users interact with LLMs using private information, secure encrypted communication becomes essential. Homomorphic encryption enables computation on encrypted data, but text generation (next-token prediction) remains a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction.

Method: TSP-based token reordering strategy to address encrypted text generation difficulties, combined with a post-processing step that reduces approximation error.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments show the method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and preserves data privacy throughout.

Conclusion: The contributions advance the feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference using homomorphic encryption.

Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using
private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling
computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored
aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation,
particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains
a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a
TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted
text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces
approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and
preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the
feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

### [156] [Towards Cross-Modal Error Detection with Tables and Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12383)
*Olga Ovcharenko,Sebastian Schelter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks cross-modal error detection methods for tabular data, finding that Cleanlab and DataScope perform best when paired with AutoML, but current methods remain limited for real-world heavy-tailed data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional error detection methods focus on single modalities and miss cross-modal errors common in domains like e-commerce and healthcare where multiple data types coexist.

Method: Benchmarked four datasets and five baseline approaches for cross-modal error detection in tabular data, evaluating methods including Cleanlab and DataScope paired with AutoML frameworks.

Result: Cleanlab (label error detection framework) and DataScope (data valuation method) achieved the highest F1 scores when used with strong AutoML frameworks.

Conclusion: Current cross-modal error detection methods remain limited, especially for heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating the need for further research in this area.

Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large
organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent
data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities.
Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single
modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common
in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data
co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal
error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our
evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them,
Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation
method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving
the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain
limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating
further research in this area.

### [157] [Enhanced Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks for Million-Scale Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12401)
*Shengyin Sun,Chen Ma,Jiehao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a self-supervised pre-training framework for GNNs on heterogeneous graphs that addresses semantic mismatch through structure-aware and semantic-aware pre-training tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN pre-training methods are designed for homogeneous graphs and don't address semantic mismatch issues, while real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous and suffer from semantic differences between original and ideal data.

Method: Designs two pre-training tasks: structure-aware task to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs, and semantic-aware task that constructs a perturbation subspace with semantic neighbors to handle semantic mismatch and improve transferability.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively pre-trains GNNs on heterogeneous graphs by addressing both structural properties and semantic mismatch, leading to better transferable knowledge for downstream tasks with limited labeled data.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the
development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient
labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be
less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a
self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks
with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely
for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not
consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data
and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this
paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale
heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which
aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design
a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we
construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal
with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the
general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in
learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments
are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. Code

### [158] [Cautious Weight Decay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12402)
*Lizhang Chen,Jonathan Li,Kaizhao Liang,Baiyu Su,Cong Xie,Nuo Wang Pierse,Chen Liang,Ni Lao,Qiang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cautious Weight Decay (CWD) is a simple modification that applies weight decay only to parameters whose signs match the optimizer update direction, improving performance without extra hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard weight decay methods implicitly change the optimization objective through regularization or constraints, which may not preserve the original loss function.

Method: CWD applies weight decay selectively - only to parameter coordinates where the sign aligns with the optimizer update direction, making it optimizer-agnostic and requiring no additional tuning.

Result: CWD consistently improves final loss and accuracy across language model pre-training and ImageNet classification tasks at million- to billion-parameter scales.

Conclusion: CWD is an effective drop-in replacement for standard weight decay that preserves the original optimization objective while providing better performance across various model scales and tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic
modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose
signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which
implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the
original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode
behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for
locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In
practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,
requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model
pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss
and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

### [159] [Continuous Uniqueness and Novelty Metrics for Generative Modeling of Inorganic Crystals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12405)
*Masahiro Negishi,Hyunsoo Park,Kinga O. Mastej,Aron Walsh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes two continuous distance functions to evaluate generative AI models for inorganic crystals, overcoming limitations of traditional distance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional crystal distance functions have four key limitations: they fail to quantify similarity degrees, cannot distinguish compositional vs structural differences, lack Lipschitz continuity, and have non-invariant uniqueness metrics.

Method: Developed two continuous distance functions that theoretically overcome the limitations of prevalent crystal distance metrics for evaluating generative models.

Result: Experiments show the proposed distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions, providing more reliable evaluation of generative models for inorganic crystals.

Conclusion: The continuous distance functions offer a more robust basis for evaluating and comparing generative AI models in materials science, particularly for sampling chemical compositions and crystal structures.

Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change,
increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being
developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible
functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions
paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness
and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function.
However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to
quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish
compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity
against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that
is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we
propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and
novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show
that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions,
providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models
for inorganic crystals.

### [160] [Bayesian Optimization for Dynamic Pricing and Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12447)
*Anush Anand,Pranav Agrawal,Tejas Bodas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a Gaussian Process-based nonparametric approach using Bayesian Optimization for dynamic pricing, outperforming traditional RL methods with better revenue and fewer assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dynamic pricing methods assume specific parametric demand functions, which may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting their applicability.

Method: Uses Gaussian Process-based Bayesian Optimization to treat demand as a black-box function, with tailored algorithms for both infinite and finite inventory settings.

Result: BO-based methods outperform state-of-the-art RL algorithms in revenue, require fewer assumptions, and offer greater robustness in experiments.

Conclusion: Bayesian Optimization is a powerful and practical tool for dynamic pricing in complex, uncertain environments, providing sample-efficient learning with regret guarantees.

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product
to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature
typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the
firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both
inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge
lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is
unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a
specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of
reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.
However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the
applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive
modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of
the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --
a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based
algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide
regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency
of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based
methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,
while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This
highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic
pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

### [161] [A Function Centric Perspective On Flat and Sharp Minima](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12451)
*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams,Helen Yannakoudakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sharp minima can correlate with better generalization, challenging the conventional belief that flat minima always indicate better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reassess the role of sharpness in deep learning, questioning the traditional view that flat minima guarantee better generalization.

Method: Extensive empirical studies across single-objective optimization to modern image classification tasks, examining models with and without regularization.

Result: Sharper minima often emerge with regularization and can coincide with better generalization, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency.

Conclusion: Function complexity, not flatness alone, governs solution geometry, and sharper minima can reflect better inductive biases under regularization.

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

### [162] [Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12453)
*Viacheslav Vasilev,Arseny Ivanov,Nikita Gushchin,Maria Kovaleva,Alexander Korotin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TCVBM extends Bridge Matching to time-correlated video data, explicitly modeling temporal dependencies to improve video generation tasks like frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with data-to-data translations between complex distributions, and existing Bridge Matching methods don't handle time-correlated sequences, which is critical for maintaining temporal coherence in video tasks.

Method: Proposed Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM) framework that extends Bridge Matching to explicitly model inter-sequence dependencies and incorporate temporal correlations directly into the diffusion bridge sampling process.

Result: TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple quantitative metrics compared to classical bridge matching and diffusion methods, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and reconstruction fidelity for video tasks.

Conclusion: TCVBM effectively addresses the limitation of existing methods in handling time-correlated data sequences, providing a robust framework for video generation and manipulation tasks that require temporal coherence.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping
from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they
struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their
effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address
this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application
to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical
limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining
temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose
Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to
time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models
inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating
temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to
classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three
video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video
super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple
quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and
reconstruction fidelity.

*Beibu Li,Qichao Shentu,Yang Shu,Hui Zhang,Ming Li,Ning Jin,Bin Yang,Chenjuan Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrossAD is a novel time series anomaly detection framework that incorporates cross-scale associations and cross-window modeling to capture dynamic multi-scale patterns and overcome fixed window limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods model multi-scale information independently or use simple fusion, neglecting dynamic cross-scale associations during anomalies, and rely on fixed sliding windows that limit contextual information capture.

Method: Proposes cross-scale reconstruction to reconstruct fine-grained series from coarser series, and designs a query library with global multi-scale context to overcome fixed window size limitations.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate CrossAD's effectiveness, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

Conclusion: CrossAD successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by explicitly modeling cross-scale associations and incorporating flexible cross-window modeling, achieving superior anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different
patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven
beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a
single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information
independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the
dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.
Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding
windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time
series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window
modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that
reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing
cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and
incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by
fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world
datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PubSub-VFL is a novel Vertical Federated Learning paradigm that uses a Publisher/Subscriber architecture to address low computational efficiency and training latency in two-party collaborative learning, achieving 2-7× speedup and up to 91.07% resource utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct data sharing between organizations raises privacy concerns, while existing Two-Party Split Learning/VFL suffers from low computational resource utilization, training inefficiency, synchronous dependency latency, and resource/data heterogeneity issues.

Method: Leverages Pub/Sub architecture decoupling and parameter server data parallelism to create hierarchical asynchronous mechanism; formalizes optimization problem based on system profiles for optimal hyperparameter selection while preserving privacy.

Result: Achieves 2-7× training acceleration without accuracy loss, computational resource utilization up to 91.07%, stable convergence, and compatibility with security protocols like differential privacy across five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: PubSub-VFL effectively addresses VFL efficiency challenges through its novel architecture, demonstrating significant performance improvements while maintaining privacy and convergence guarantees.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational
resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

### [165] [Mitigating the Noise Shift for Denoising Generative Models via Noise Awareness Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12497)
*Jincheng Zhong,Boyuan Jiang,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Kun Gai,Mingsheng Long*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies "noise shift" - a misalignment between pre-defined noise levels and actual noise in intermediate states during diffusion model sampling, and proposes Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG) to correct this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing denoising generative models suffer from noise shift, a pervasive issue where pre-defined noise levels don't match actual noise in intermediate states, leading to sub-optimal generation quality.

Method: Proposes Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG) to steer sampling trajectories to remain consistent with pre-defined noise schedule, and introduces a classifier-free variant using noise-condition dropout.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet generation and supervised fine-tuning tasks show NAG consistently mitigates noise shift and substantially improves generation quality of mainstream diffusion models.

Conclusion: NAG effectively addresses the noise shift problem in diffusion models, leading to improved generation quality through better alignment with pre-defined noise schedules.

Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time
SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue
in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level
and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We
refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and
exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both
out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address
this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective
correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain
consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a
classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a
noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the
need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet
generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently
mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of
mainstream diffusion models.

*Huiyang Yi,Yanyan He,Duxin Chen,Mingyu Kang,He Wang,Wenwu Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks causal discovery algorithms under model assumption violations, finding differentiable methods show robustness except for scale variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery algorithms rely on unverifiable assumptions that are hard to satisfy in real-world data, limiting practical applications.

Method: Extensive benchmarking of mainstream causal discovery algorithms under eight model assumption violations using i.i.d. data assumptions.

Result: Differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness in most scenarios (measured by Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance) except for scale variation.

Conclusion: The work provides comprehensive benchmarking standards for evaluating causal discovery methods and aims to promote their real-world application.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: Multi-armed bandit with contextual information where arms must receive minimum aggregated rewards across contexts while maximizing total cumulative reward, addressing fair revenue allocation problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address real-world applications requiring fair revenue allocation across contexts where contextual variation is inherent, capturing scenarios where minimum reward guarantees are needed.

Method: Design algorithms that either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce constraint satisfaction, with analysis of both approaches.

Result: Derived problem-dependent upper bounds on both regret and constraint violations, and established a lower bound showing optimal time horizon dependence.

Conclusion: The cross-context aggregation introduces technical challenges without closed-form optimal allocations, and the analysis reveals fundamental limitations of free exploration principles from prior work.

Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where
the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward
across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward.
This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair
revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The
cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better
performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges
-- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically
available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that
either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce
constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper
bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a
lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our
results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free
exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

Motivation: Growing demand for privacy-compliant, energy-efficient real-time ECG analysis requires new approaches at the point of data acquisition, with edge computing reducing latency and improving data security.

Method: Analysis of various ECG signal pre-processing steps for applicability in edge computing, selecting methods based on energy efficiency, processing capability, and real-time performance criteria.

Result: Not explicitly stated in the abstract, but focuses on evaluating suitable pre-processing methods for the FACE project's edge-cloud computing framework.

Conclusion: Edge computing is increasingly important for ECG analysis due to reduced latency and enhanced data security, requiring careful selection of pre-processing methods that meet energy efficiency and real-time requirements.

Abstract: The increasing popularity of portable ECG systems and the growing demand for
privacy-compliant, energy-efficient real-time analysis require new approaches
to signal processing at the point of data acquisition. In this context, the
edge domain is acquiring increasing importance, as it not only reduces latency
times, but also enables an increased level of data security. The FACE project
aims to develop an innovative machine learning solution for analysing long-term
electrocardiograms that synergistically combines the strengths of edge and
cloud computing. In this thesis, various pre-processing steps of ECG signals
are analysed with regard to their applicability in the project. The selection
of suitable methods in the edge area is based in particular on criteria such as
energy efficiency, processing capability and real-time capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite growing organizational interest in cross-silo FL due to data protection regulations (GDPR, HIPAA), its adoption remains limited in practice, prompting investigation into the underlying challenges.

Method: Conducted interviews with diverse stakeholders including user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers to understand practical barriers to cross-silo FL adoption.

Result: Uncovered various barriers including concerns about model performance, questions of incentives, and trust issues between participating organizations that are distinct from other FL forms like cross-device FL.

Conclusion: Cross-silo FL faces unique practical challenges not well-captured by existing research, requiring future research directions to overcome these adoption barriers.

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable
cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without
directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven
by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of
cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an
interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with
cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders
such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we
uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of
incentives and trust between participating organizations. Our study shows that
cross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by
existing research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of
federated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future
research directions that can help overcome these challenges.

*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams,Helen Yannakoudakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Knowledge distillation functions more as a data-dependent regularizer with negative asymmetric payoff rather than as an effective compression mechanism, with limited knowledge transfer and safety concerns due to negative knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the functional impact and compression capacity of knowledge distillation beyond just accuracy metrics, and to decouple compression from architectural reduction.

Method: Used hypothesis testing, controls, random control distillation across multiple modalities, distillation variants, and analyzed scaling laws across model sizes in 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets.

Result: Knowledge transfer is less pronounced than anticipated, with statistically significant transfer only in some modalities/architectures. Found consistent asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to students, raising safety concerns.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation primarily functions as a data-dependent regularizer with negative asymmetric payoff rather than as an effective compression mechanism.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

### [171] [Towards Fast Coarse-graining and Equation Discovery with Foundation Inference Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12618)
*Manuel Hinz,Maximilian Mauel,Patrick Seifner,David Berghaus,Kostadin Cvejoski,Ramses J. Sanchez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to decouple the discovery of coarse-grained variables from fitting governing equations by using pretrained Foundation Inference Models (FIMs) to estimate infinitesimal generators, enabling stable representation learning through a simulation-consistent loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional dynamical processes often have low-dimensional latent dynamics, but existing machine learning approaches jointly solve variable discovery and equation fitting, which can be unstable. The authors aim to decouple these problems for more efficient coarse-graining.

Method: Use pretrained FIMs with frozen weights to estimate infinitesimal generators (drift and diffusion) in zero-shot mode, then train only the encoder-decoder map using a simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning.

Result: A proof of concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion embedded in synthetic video data demonstrates the approach's potential for fast and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully decouples variable discovery from dynamics fitting using FIMs, providing a stable and efficient approach for identifying latent dynamics in high-dimensional systems.

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by
a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional
manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined
problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously
fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these
tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce
dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging
the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained
models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,
the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot
mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen
weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,
simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of
concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded
into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast
and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

*Yuta Kobayashi,Zilin Jing,Jiayu Yao,Hongseok Namkoong,Shalmali Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Learning-to-Measure (L2M), a meta-learning approach for active feature acquisition that learns acquisition policies across various tasks without per-task retraining, using uncertainty-guided greedy feature selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current active feature acquisition methods are limited to single predetermined tasks and struggle with systematic missingness in features and limited task-specific labels, limiting scalability across multiple tasks.

Method: L2M uses sequence-modeling/autoregressive pre-training for reliable uncertainty quantification and an uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional mutual information. It operates directly on datasets with retrospective missingness and performs meta-AFA in-context.

Result: L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines across synthetic and real-world tabular benchmarks, particularly under conditions of scarce labels and high missingness.

Conclusion: The proposed meta-AFA framework with L2M successfully addresses the scalability limitations of single-task AFA methods and demonstrates robust performance across diverse tasks without requiring per-task retraining.

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem
where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively
selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from
retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited
task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single
predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we
formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies
across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of
i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an
uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional
mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive
pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for
tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with
retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context,
eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular
benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly
under scarce labels and high missingness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Laminar is a scalable RL post-training system that breaks global synchronization bottlenecks through trajectory-level asynchrony, achieving 5.48× throughput speedup over state-of-the-art systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL frameworks suffer from severe GPU underutilization due to extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation, and global synchronization creates rigid model update schedules that cripple training efficiency.

Method: Proposes a fully decoupled architecture with: 1) relay workers for distributed parameter service enabling asynchronous weight synchronization, and 2) dynamic repack mechanism to consolidate long-tail trajectories onto dedicated rollouts.

Result: Evaluation on 1024-GPU cluster shows up to 5.48× training throughput speedup over state-of-the-art systems while reducing model convergence time.

Conclusion: Laminar's trajectory-level asynchrony and fully decoupled design enable efficient scaling of RL post-training for LLMs by breaking synchronization bottlenecks and isolating failures.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

*Arip Asadulaev,Fakhri Karray,Martin Takac*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bellman Wasserstein Distance (BWD), a value-aware optimal transport metric that estimates offline RL dataset quality without training agents, enabling dataset triaging and improved policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL datasets vary widely in quality but are difficult to assess a priori since data provenance and skill composition are unknown, making algorithm selection challenging.

Method: Proposes BWD - a value-aware optimal transport score computed from a behavioral critic and state conditional OT formulation that measures how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy, requiring no environment interaction.

Result: BWD strongly correlates with oracle performance scores across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, enabling efficient prediction of offline RL agent performance. When used as a regularizer, BWD improves policy returns by pushing learned policies away from random behavior.

Conclusion: Value-aware distributional signals like BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and enhancing policy optimization without environment interaction.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets,
without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets
vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random
trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity.
Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or
low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful
behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset
quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are
unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without
training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative
rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman
Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures
how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy.
BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT
formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization.
Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance
score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient
prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond
prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization
explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves
returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such
as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy
optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML models require building and training from scratch for each new dataset, which is slow and costly for scientific fields analyzing event sequences.

Method: Train a single foundation model on millions of simulated event sequences to learn general patterns, then apply it to new datasets with few-shot learning or fine-tuning.

Result: The model can analyze new scientific data instantly without retraining, and can be fine-tuned for higher accuracy.

Conclusion: This approach makes sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates scientific discovery across multiple fields.

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing
sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally,
machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new
dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a
single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in
context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event
sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can
unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly,
without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It
can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes
sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of
scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate data-driven modeling of dynamical systems as ODEs is challenging, especially with sparse or noisy data, which is common across natural sciences.

Method: The model uses a pretrained neural operator trained on synthetic data to perform zero-shot ODE inference from sparse and noisy observations, handling corrupted data robustly.

Result: FIM-ODE provides accurate ODE estimates comparable to state-of-the-art neural methods, with qualitative comparisons of estimated vector fields showing promising performance.

Conclusion: FIM-ODE demonstrates effective zero-shot ODE inference from sparse, noisy data using pretrained neural operators, offering a robust approach for dynamical system modeling.

Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe dynamical systems evolving
deterministically in continuous time. Accurate data-driven modeling of systems
as ODEs, a central problem across the natural sciences, remains challenging,
especially if the data is sparse or noisy. We introduce FIM-ODE (Foundation
Inference Model for ODEs), a pretrained neural model designed to estimate ODEs
zero-shot (i.e., in context) from sparse and noisy observations. Trained on
synthetic data, the model utilizes a flexible neural operator for robust ODE
inference, even from corrupted data. We empirically verify that FIM-ODE
provides accurate estimates, on par with a neural state-of-the-art method, and
qualitatively compare the structure of their estimated vector fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SG-XDEAT is a novel framework for supervised tabular data learning that uses dual-stream encoding with raw and target-conditioned representations, enhanced by cross-dimensional attention, cross-encoding attention, and adaptive sparse attention for noise reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more robust deep learning model for tabular data by jointly modeling raw feature values and target-aware representations while dynamically filtering out noisy information.

Method: Uses dual-stream encoder with raw value and target-conditioned streams, hierarchical attention modules including cross-dimensional self-attention, cross-encoding self-attention, and adaptive sparse self-attention that suppresses low-utility tokens.

Result: Empirical results on multiple public benchmarks show consistent performance gains over strong baselines.

Conclusion: Jointly modeling raw and target-aware views with adaptive noise filtering yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Motivation: Large Whisper model sizes limit deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, requiring efficient variants.

Result: Achieved 35.4% parameter reduction, 14.25% lower memory, 18.5% fewer FLOPs on Whisper-small; 31% parameter reduction, 15.29% lower memory, 16.95% fewer FLOPs on Whisper-medium without WER degradation; outperformed Iterative Magnitude Pruning by 18.7% more parameters and 12.31 WER reduction.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully creates efficient Whisper variants suitable for edge deployment while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Whisper models have achieved remarkable progress in speech recognition; yet
their large size remains a bottleneck for deployment on resource-constrained
edge devices. This paper proposes a framework to design fine-tuned variants of
Whisper which address the above problem. Structured sparsity is enforced via
the Sparse Group LASSO penalty as a loss regularizer, to reduce the number of
FLOating Point operations (FLOPs). Further, a weight statistics aware pruning
algorithm is proposed. We also design our custom text normalizer for WER
evaluation. On Common Voice 11.0 Hindi dataset, we obtain, without degrading
WER, (a) 35.4% reduction in model parameters, 14.25% lower memory consumption
and 18.5% fewer FLOPs on Whisper-small, and (b) 31% reduction in model
parameters, 15.29% lower memory consumption and 16.95% fewer FLOPs on

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Uniform edge sampling suffices for spectral clustering in well-separated graphs, bypassing the need for expensive effective resistance calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral clustering's reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs, and classical sparsification methods require expensive preprocessing to estimate effective resistances.

Method: Uniformly sample O(γ²n log n/ε²) edges, where γ is the Laplacian condition number, and prove this preserves the spectral subspace used for clustering in graphs with large structure ratio Υ(k) = λ_{k+1}/ρ_G(k).

Result: The sparsifier's top (n-k)-dimensional eigenspace remains approximately orthogonal to cluster indicators, ensuring spectral embedding fidelity and preserved clustering quality.

Conclusion: Under strong clusterability, uniform sampling is structure-aware, providing the first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for structure-preserving spectral clustering.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its
reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.
Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges
proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive
preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge
sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral
clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated
$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) =
\lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace
used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2
n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition
number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is
approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the
spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our
analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a
rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound
adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance
sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based
clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong
clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the
first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for
structure-preserving spectral clustering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety guardrails through adversarial prompts, creating a need for effective safety mechanisms that don't require extensive retraining.

Method: Uses Concept Alignment and Concept Manipulation (CALM) to modify latent representations in the last layer via orthogonal projection and CW technique from Computer Vision to remove harmful concept directions while preserving model performance.

Result: CALM reduces harmful outputs and outperforms baseline methods in most metrics, with only small computational overhead at inference and no need for additional training data or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: CALM offers a lightweight, effective approach to AI safety that can suppress harmful concepts during inference without model retraining, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that bypass
built-in safety guardrails (e.g., by tricking the model with adversarial

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current hybrid thinking LLMs have poor mode separation with reasoning behaviors leaking into no-think mode. The paper identifies key factors for better controllability and proposes a training recipe that reduces no-think output length and reasoning tokens while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid thinking allows LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct answering for efficiency, but current implementations suffer from poor mode separation where reasoning behaviors leak into no-think mode.

Method: Analyzed factors influencing controllability and identified four key factors: larger data scale, using think/no-think answers from different questions, moderate increase in no-think data, and two-phase training strategy. Proposed a practical training recipe based on these findings.

Result: The proposed recipe significantly reduces no-think output length (from 1085 to 585 on MATH500) and reasoning-supportive tokens like "wait" (from 5917 to 522 on MATH500) while maintaining accuracy in both modes.

Conclusion: Current hybrid thinking has limitations in mode separation, but the identified factors and proposed training recipe offer directions for improving controllability and reducing reasoning leakage in no-think mode.

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoRA is a covariate-aware adaptation framework that enhances Time Series Foundation Models by incorporating exogenous covariates from multiple modalities while preserving pre-trained backbone knowledge through frozen feature extraction and zero-initialized condition injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Time Series Foundation Models are typically pre-trained on univariate time series, making them unaware of crucial information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks, which limits their performance.

Method: CoRA maintains frozen pre-trained backbones as feature extractors, uses Granger Causality Embedding to evaluate covariate predictability, and employs zero-initialized condition-injection to gradually integrate exogenous information without catastrophic forgetting.

Result: CoRA achieves 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting and surpasses state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with both full and few-shot training samples.

Conclusion: CoRA presents a practical paradigm for applying Time Series Foundation Models by effectively incorporating diverse covariate modalities while maintaining strong compatibility with various TSFMs.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through
their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due
to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability
on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on
univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial
information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further
enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware
adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of
foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from
various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the
quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of
initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved
backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome
embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative
than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)
to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with
respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a
zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous
information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses
state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot
training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.
Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with
various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,
presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.

TL;DR: A novel framework for detecting abnormal stops in intercity coach transportation using sparsity-aware segmentation and graph-based semi-supervised learning to overcome GPS data sparsity and limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in abnormal stop detection caused by sparse GPS trajectories that obscure short/unauthorized stops and limited labeled data that restricts supervised learning.

Method: Propose Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) to define segment boundaries, develop three domain-specific indicators, apply Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA) for smoothing, construct spatial-temporal graph with label propagation and GCN, and use self-training with pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves AUC of 0.854 and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances on real-world coach data, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses data sparsity and label scarcity in abnormal stop detection, demonstrating superior performance with minimal labeled data.

Abstract: Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical
for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory
compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS
trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled
data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense
sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address
data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that
adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density.
Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to
capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we
develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths
these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we
construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with
LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision
across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final
self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively
improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854
and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

Motivation: Learning diffusion models from only corrupted or noisy observations remains challenging, as traditional methods require clean data.

Method: Propose DiffEM method that uses conditional diffusion models to reconstruct clean data in E-step, then refines the model in M-step using reconstructed data.

Result: Theoretical monotonic convergence guarantees under appropriate statistical conditions. Demonstrated effectiveness on various image reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: DiffEM provides a principled approach to train diffusion models from corrupted data with guaranteed convergence, enabling applications where only noisy observations are available.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image

*Vicente Bosca,Tatum Rask,Sunia Tanweer,Andrew R. Tawfeek,Branden Stone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes topological signatures of ReLU neural networks through polytope decomposition of feature space, examining Fiedler partitions for binary classification and homology for regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the topological structure of ReLU neural network activation patterns relates to network behavior and decision boundaries.

Method: Analyze polytope decomposition of feature space induced by ReLU networks, investigate Fiedler partitions of dual graphs for binary classification, and compute homology of cellular decomposition for regression tasks.

Result: Fiedler partition appears to correlate with decision boundaries in binary classification, and similar patterns are observed between training loss and polyhedral cell-count during model training in regression tasks.

Conclusion: Topological signatures from activation patterns provide insights into neural network behavior, with Fiedler partitions revealing decision boundaries and homology tracking training dynamics.

Abstract: This paper explores the topological signatures of ReLU neural network
activation patterns. We consider feedforward neural networks with ReLU
activation functions and analyze the polytope decomposition of the feature
space induced by the network. Mainly, we investigate how the Fiedler partition
of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision
boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the
homology of the cellular decomposition -- in a regression task -- to draw
similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral
cell-count, as the model is trained.

TL;DR: Multitask finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network models (KERMT and KGPT) significantly improves drug discovery predictions, with the most substantial gains at larger data sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage self-supervised chemical knowledge from pretrained models to improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints like on-target potency and ADMET properties, building on previous success of multi-task learning.

Method: Enhanced multitask finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network models (KERMT - an enhanced GROVER version, and KGPT) compared to non-pretrained models, with publication of multitask ADMET data splits for benchmarking.

Result: Multitask finetuning significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network models, with the most significant performance improvement observed at larger data sizes.

Conclusion: Multitask finetuning of chemical pretrained models provides substantial benefits for drug discovery applications, particularly with larger datasets, and the released resources enable better benchmarking and industrial-scale implementation.

Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are
receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general
chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to
improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target
potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been
successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that
enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network
models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the
GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT)
significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network
models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning
KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes.
Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more
accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property
prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT
model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference
in industrial drug discovery workflows.

### [187] [CARVQ: Corrective Adaptor with Group Residual Vector Quantization for LLM Embedding Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12721)
*Dayin Gou,Sanghyun Byun,Nilesh Malpeddi,Gabrielle De Micheli,Prathamesh Vaste,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CARVQ is a novel compression method that combines Corrective Adaptor with group Residual Vector Quantization to compress LLM embedding layers to ~1.6 bits, reducing memory footprint for edge device deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have large embedding layers that require substantial storage and memory, especially problematic for memory-constrained edge devices where reducing memory footprint can free bandwidth and speed up inference.

Method: Post-training compression using Corrective Adaptor combined with group Residual Vector Quantization, composing linear and non-linear maps to mimic original embedding while compressing to ~1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware.

Result: Tested on multiple LLMs (LLaMA-3.2-1B, LLaMA-3.2-3B, etc.) across generative, discriminative, math and reasoning tasks. Achieves lower average bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy compared to scalar quantization.

Conclusion: CARVQ provides a crucial step toward efficient LLM deployment on edge devices, offering a compression technique compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization methods that can be integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit memory.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters
for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory
footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and
reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees
up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we
introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group
Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear
and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to
approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support
lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,
LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B
and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning
tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average
bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy
compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression
technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization
methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit
memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.
This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs
on edge devices.

*Juha Harviainen,Frank Sommer,Manuel Sorge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the complexity of optimizing decision trees through local operations like adjusting thresholds or exchanging features, showing these problems are NP-complete but tractable when combining small feature count and domain size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational complexity of common heuristic operations used in decision tree learning algorithms, specifically threshold adjustment and feature exchange operations.

Method: Parameterized-complexity analysis of decision tree optimization problems, developing algorithms that exploit combinations of parameters like feature count and domain size to achieve fixed-parameter tractability.

Result: The problems are NP-complete in general but become fixed-parameter tractable when combining small feature count (d) and small domain size (D), with an algorithm running in (D+1)^(2d) * |I|^O(1) time.

Conclusion: The hardness of decision tree optimization stems from certain parameter combinations, but tractability can be achieved by exploiting the interplay between feature count and domain size, with practical implementation showing empirical promise.

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search
operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging
the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification
errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations.
Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in
general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the
aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness
and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the
problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size
$D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is,
the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$
is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
this algorithm and report on empirical results.

*Anas Abouaomar,Mohammed El hanjri,Abdellatif Kobbane,Anis Laouiti,Khalid Nafil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical federated learning architecture for smart agriculture with seasonal subscription mechanism, enabling crop-specific model training and global knowledge integration while preserving data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for crop yield prediction in smart agriculture while preserving data privacy and handling heterogeneous farming environments with sensitive agricultural data.

Method: Three-layer hierarchical architecture with seasonal subscription: individual farms at client level, crop-specific aggregators at middle layer, and global model aggregator at top level. Farms join crop-specific clusters each season for collaborative training.

Result: Local and crop-layer models closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly outperforming standard machine learning models.

Conclusion: Hierarchical federated learning is advantageous for agricultural contexts, particularly for heterogeneous farming environments and privacy-sensitive data scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

*Jon Donnelly,Srikar Katta,Emanuele Borgonovo,Cynthia Rudin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UNIVERSE introduces a method to bound variable importance (VI) estimates using Rashomon sets, addressing issues of omitted variables and model dependence in VI analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard VI methods are unreliable due to omitted variables and the Rashomon Effect, where different equally-good models give different VI estimates.

Method: Adapts Rashomon sets (sets of near-optimal models) to produce bounds on true VI even with missing features, with theoretical guarantees.

Result: Shows strong performance on semi-synthetic simulations and demonstrates utility in credit risk applications.

Conclusion: UNIVERSE provides robust VI bounds that account for model uncertainty and omitted variables, improving reliability of VI analysis.

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation,
feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an
analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed
features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other
variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted
from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often
not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon
known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing
UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts
(UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models
in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We
theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance
on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk
task.

### [191] [KoALA: KL-L0 Adversarial Detector via Label Agreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12752)
*Siqi Li,Yasser Shoukry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KoALA is a semantics-free adversarial detector that uses disagreement between KL divergence and L0-based similarity metrics to detect adversarial attacks without architectural changes or adversarial retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing serious risks to security- and safety-critical applications, necessitating effective detection methods.

Method: KoALA detects adversarial attacks when class predictions from two complementary similarity metrics (KL divergence for dense perturbations and L0-based similarity for sparse perturbations) disagree. It requires only simple fine-tuning of a pre-trained image encoder using clean images.

Result: KoALA achieves precision of 0.94 and recall of 0.81 on ResNet/CIFAR-10, and precision of 0.66 and recall of 0.85 on CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet. When theorem conditions are met, it consistently detects adversarial examples.

Conclusion: KoALA provides a lightweight, plug-and-play solution for adversarial detection across various models and data modalities, with formal proof of correctness and strong experimental performance.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which
pose significant risks to security- and safety-critical applications. We
present KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel,
semantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or
adversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an
adversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity
metrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are
specifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL
divergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the
L0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a
formal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a
simple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to
ensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a
lightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data
modalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet
confirm our theoretical claims. When the theorem's conditions are met, KoALA
consistently and effectively detects adversarial examples. On the full test
sets, KoALA achieves a precision of 0.94 and a recall of 0.81 on
ResNet/CIFAR-10, and a precision of 0.66 and a recall of 0.85 on
CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet.

### [192] [Sample-Efficient Omniprediction for Proper Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12769)
*Isaac Gibbs,Ryan J. Tibshirani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that enable accurate decisions for multiple downstream users, focusing on omniprediction where a single predictor minimizes multiple losses simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to design optimal predictors that work well for multiple decision makers with different loss functions, going beyond single decision maker scenarios where proper loss minimization suffices.

Method: The paper analyzes two existing approaches: 1) boosting methods using multicalibration, and 2) adversarial two-player game methods. It proposes a more direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural properties of proper losses.

Result: The paper shows that multicalibration is strictly harder than omniprediction, leading to suboptimal sample complexity. It improves upon online-to-batch conversion methods by providing a sample-efficient, deterministic algorithm.

Conclusion: The paper presents a more efficient approach to omniprediction that avoids the complexity of randomized predictors while leveraging the structure of proper losses for better performance.

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead
to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For
a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to
minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that
individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a
variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor
that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for
achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods
that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain
omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based
approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online
fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly
more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must
incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how
these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an
online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a
complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more
direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of
proper losses.

### [193] [Normalization-equivariant Diffusion Models: Learning Posterior Samplers From Noisy And Partial Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11964)
*Brett Levac,Jon Tamir,Marcelo Pereyra,Julian Tachella*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: First approach for training diffusion models using only noisy measurement data from a single operator, enabling image restoration without clean training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models require clean training data, which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios where only noisy/incomplete measurements exist.

Method: Leverages scale equivariance property of denoisers to generalize to lower noise levels, combined with equivariant imaging framework for incomplete data.

Result: Successfully trains diffusion models for image restoration tasks (denoising, demosaicing, inpainting) using only noisy single-operator measurements.

Conclusion: Enables practical deployment of diffusion models in real-world scenarios where clean training data is unavailable.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have rapidly emerged as a powerful framework for image
generation and restoration. However, existing DMs are primarily trained in a
supervised manner by using a large corpus of clean images. This reliance on
clean data poses fundamental challenges in many real-world scenarios, where
acquiring noise-free data is hard or infeasible, and only noisy and potentially
incomplete measurements are available. While some methods can train DMs using
noisy data, they are generally effective only when the amount of noise is very
mild or when some additional noise-free data is available. In addition,
existing methods for training DMs from incomplete measurements require access
to multiple complementary acquisition processes, an assumption that poses a
significant practical limitation. Here we introduce the first approach for
learning DMs for image restoration using only noisy measurement data from a
single operator. As a first key contribution, we show that DMs, and more
broadly minimum mean squared error denoisers, exhibit a weak form of scale
equivariance linking rescaling in signal amplitude to changes in noise
intensity. We then leverage this theoretical insight to develop a denoising
score-matching strategy that generalizes robustly to noise levels lower than
those present in the training data, thereby enabling the learning of DMs from
noisy measurements. To further address the challenges of incomplete and noisy
data, we integrate our method with equivariant imaging, a complementary
self-supervised learning framework that exploits the inherent invariants of
imaging problems, to train DMs for image restoration from single-operator
measurements that are both incomplete and noisy. We validate the effectiveness
of our approach through extensive experiments on image denoising, demosaicing,
and inpainting, along with comparisons with the state of the art.

TL;DR: LiteVPNet is a lightweight neural network that predicts Quantisation Parameters for NVENC AV1 encoders to achieve specified VMAF scores, improving energy efficiency and quality control in video streaming workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: New cinema production workflows like On-set Virtual Production require precise quality control and energy efficiency, which existing transcoding approaches fail to provide adequately.

Method: Uses a lightweight neural network with low-complexity features including bitstream characteristics, video complexity measures, and CLIP-based semantic embeddings to predict Quantisation Parameters.

Result: Achieves mean VMAF errors below 1.2 points across quality targets, with VMAF errors within 2 points for over 87% of test corpus (vs. ~61% with state-of-the-art methods).

Conclusion: LiteVPNet enhances high-value content transport and streaming for more energy-efficient, high-quality media experiences.

Abstract: In the last decade, video workflows in the cinema production ecosystem have
presented new use cases for video streaming technology. These new workflows,
e.g. in On-set Virtual Production, present the challenge of requiring precise
quality control and energy efficiency. Existing approaches to transcoding often
fall short of these requirements, either due to a lack of quality control or
computational overhead. To fill this gap, we present a lightweight neural
network (LiteVPNet) for accurately predicting Quantisation Parameters for NVENC
AV1 encoders that achieve a specified VMAF score. We use low-complexity
features, including bitstream characteristics, video complexity measures, and
CLIP-based semantic embeddings. Our results demonstrate that LiteVPNet achieves
mean VMAF errors below 1.2 points across a wide range of quality targets.
Notably, LiteVPNet achieves VMAF errors within 2 points for over 87% of our
test corpus, c.f. approx 61% with state-of-the-art methods. LiteVPNet's
performance across various quality regions highlights its applicability for
enhancing high-value content transport and streaming for more energy-efficient,
high-quality media experiences.

TL;DR: Analysis of AV1 encoder configurations to reduce decoding complexity and energy consumption on battery-constrained devices, showing specific settings can significantly lower decoding cycles with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High decoding complexity of advanced video codecs like AV1 hinders adoption on battery-constrained devices, requiring methods to estimate and reduce decoding energy overhead.

Method: Systematic analysis of disabling various coding tools and adjusting parameters in libaom-av1 and SVT-AV1 encoders, using system-level energy measurement tools (RAPL, Intel SoC Watch with VTune profiler) to quantify trade-offs.

Result: Specific encoder configurations substantially reduce decoding complexity: libaom-av1 with CDEF disabled reduces decoding cycles by 10%; SVT-AV1 with fast-decode=2 preset reduces cycles by 24%, with minimal perceptual quality degradation.

Conclusion: Findings provide content providers with strategies to lower energy footprint of AV1 video streaming through optimized encoder configurations.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of advanced video codecs such as AV1 is often
hindered by their high decoding complexity, posing a challenge for
battery-constrained devices. While encoders can be configured to produce
bitstreams that are decoder-friendly, estimating the decoding complexity and
energy overhead for a given video is non-trivial. In this study, we
systematically analyse the impact of disabling various coding tools and
adjusting coding parameters in two AV1 encoders, libaom-av1 and SVT-AV1. Using
system-level energy measurement tools like RAPL (Running Average Power Limit),
Intel SoC Watch (integrated with VTune profiler), we quantify the resulting
trade-offs between decoding complexity, energy consumption, and compression
efficiency for decoding a bitstream. Our results demonstrate that specific
encoder configurations can substantially reduce decoding complexity with
minimal perceptual quality degradation. For libaom-av1, disabling CDEF, an
in-loop filter gives us a mean reduction in decoding cycles by 10%. For
SVT-AV1, using the in-built, fast-decode=2 preset achieves a more substantial
24% reduction in decoding cycles. These findings provide strategies for content
providers to lower the energy footprint of AV1 video streaming.

TL;DR: MH-LVC is a multi-hypothesis temporal prediction scheme that uses long- and short-term reference frames in conditional residual video coding, addressing memory access issues while maintaining coding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of excessive memory access in conditional video coding approaches that require storing large amounts of implicit contextual information from past decoded frames.

Method: Uses a multi-hypothesis temporal prediction scheme with long- and short-term reference frames, limiting reference frames to two at a time. Implements decoded frame buffer management that allows flexible use of long-term key frames and short-term reference frames, with adaptable temporal prediction structure.

Result: Outperforms VTM-17.0 under low-delay B configuration in PSNR-RGB across test datasets, performs comparably to state-of-the-art learned codecs like DCVC-FM while requiring less decoded frame buffer and similar decoding time.

Conclusion: The proposed MH-LVC method successfully addresses memory access challenges in learned video codecs while maintaining competitive coding performance and enabling flexible temporal prediction structures.

Abstract: This work, termed MH-LVC, presents a multi-hypothesis temporal prediction
scheme that employs long- and short-term reference frames in a conditional
residual video coding framework. Recent temporal context mining approaches to
conditional video coding offer superior coding performance. However, the need
to store and access a large amount of implicit contextual information extracted
from past decoded frames in decoding a video frame poses a challenge due to
excessive memory access. Our MH-LVC overcomes this issue by storing multiple
long- and short-term reference frames but limiting the number of reference
frames used at a time for temporal prediction to two. Our decoded frame buffer
management allows the encoder to flexibly utilize the long-term key frames to
mitigate temporal cascading errors and the short-term reference frames to
minimize prediction errors. Moreover, our buffering scheme enables the temporal
prediction structure to be adapted to individual input videos. While this
flexibility is common in traditional video codecs, it has not been fully
explored for learned video codecs. Extensive experiments show that the proposed
method outperforms VTM-17.0 under the low-delay B configuration in terms of
PSNR-RGB across commonly used test datasets, and performs comparably to the
state-of-the-art learned codecs (e.g.~DCVC-FM) while requiring less decoded
frame buffer and similar decoding time.

TL;DR: A Gaussian process regression model predicts hardware video encoder energy consumption with ~9% MAPE, identifying spatial resolution as a key feature for energy estimation across different resolutions and codec settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Live streaming from battery-powered devices requires real-time video encoding, and hardware encoders are energy-intensive. There's a need to predict encoding energy consumption to optimize battery usage.

Method: Developed a high-level feature model using Gaussian process regression to predict hardware video encoder energy consumption, focusing on P-frames and single keyframes.

Result: The model achieved approximately 9% mean absolute percentage error in predicting encoding energy, with spatial resolution identified as the most important feature through ablation studies.

Conclusion: The proposed model enables practical prior estimation of encoding energy requirements for various spatial resolutions, coding standards, and codec presets, supporting energy optimization in live streaming applications.

Abstract: In today's society, live video streaming and user generated content streamed
from battery powered devices are ubiquitous. Live streaming requires real-time
video encoding, and hardware video encoders are well suited for such an
encoding task. In this paper, we introduce a high-level feature model using
Gaussian process regression that can predict the encoding energy of a hardware
video encoder. In an evaluation setup restricted to only P-frames and a single
keyframe, the model can predict the encoding energy with a mean absolute
percentage error of approximately 9%. Further, we demonstrate with an ablation
study that spatial resolution is a key high-level feature for encoding energy
prediction of a hardware encoder. A practical application of our model is that
it can be used to perform a prior estimation of the energy required to encode a
video at various spatial resolutions, with different coding standards and codec
presets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To realize analog compressed sensing by developing hardware-friendly implementations of proximal operators that can be physically realized using analog circuits.

Method: Use forward voltage-current characteristics of PN-junction diodes in electric analog circuits to create approximate proximal operators for ℓ₁ and MCP regularization functions, then employ these in compressed sensing with proximal gradient method.

Result: Computer simulations demonstrate successful sparse reconstruction performance using the proposed approximate proximal operators, while accounting for additive noise from analog devices.

Conclusion: The proposed analog circuit implementation using PN-junction diodes provides a viable approach for realizing approximate proximal operators in analog compressed sensing systems.

Abstract: In order to realize analog compressed sensing, the paper considers

performance of the algorithms using the proposed approximate proximal operators
is demonstrated via computer simulations taking into account the impact of
additive noise introduced by analog devices.

TL;DR: FedLoDrop applies dropout to Federated LoRA's trainable matrix to enhance generalization while reducing training costs, with optimization of dropout rates and resource allocation to minimize generalization error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalization ability of fine-tuned LLMs while reducing training costs in federated learning settings, especially at network edges with limited resources.

Method: Proposes FedLoDrop framework with dropout on LoRA matrices, formulates optimization problem for dropout rate and resource allocation, and develops B&B and P-SCA algorithms for solution.

Result: Numerical results show effectiveness in mitigating overfitting and improving generalization capability while reducing communication costs.

Conclusion: FedLoDrop successfully balances underfitting and overfitting through dropout-based sparsity regularization and optimized resource allocation, achieving better generalization in federated fine-tuning scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-tuning (FT) large language models (LLMs) is crucial for adapting
general-purpose models to specific tasks, enhancing accuracy and relevance with
minimal resources. To further enhance generalization ability while reducing
training costs, this paper proposes Federated LoRA with Dropout (FedLoDrop), a
new framework that applies dropout to the rows and columns of the trainable
matrix in Federated LoRA. A generalization error bound and convergence analysis
under sparsity regularization are obtained, which elucidate the fundamental
trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. The error bound reveals that a
higher dropout rate increases model sparsity, thereby lowering the upper bound
of pointwise hypothesis stability (PHS). While this reduces the gap between
empirical and generalization errors, it also incurs a higher empirical error,
which, together with the gap, determines the overall generalization error. On
the other hand, though dropout reduces communication costs, deploying FedLoDrop
at the network edge still faces challenges due to limited network resources. To
address this issue, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the upper
bound of the generalization error, by jointly optimizing the dropout rate and
resource allocation subject to the latency and per-device energy consumption
constraints. To solve this problem, a branch-and-bound (B\&B)-based method is
proposed to obtain its globally optimal solution. Moreover, to reduce the high
computational complexity of the B\&B-based method, a penalized successive
convex approximation (P-SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to efficiently obtain
its high-quality suboptimal solution. Finally, numerical results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating overfitting and
improving the generalization capability.

*Zahra Mobini,Hien Quoc Ngo,Ardavan Rahimian,Anvar Tukmanov,David Townend,Michail Matthaiou,Simon L. Cotton*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes hybrid centralized-distributed precoding for fronthaul-limited cell-free massive MIMO systems, dynamically adapting to fronthaul and spectral efficiency requirements through user grouping and power control optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of fronthaul limitations in cell-free massive MIMO systems by developing a flexible precoding strategy that can adapt to varying fronthaul capacity and spectral efficiency needs.

Method: Divides users into two groups served by either centralized or distributed precoding, formulates optimization problem for user grouping and power control to maximize sum spectral efficiency under fronthaul and power constraints, and develops efficient solution algorithms.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate the hybrid scheme's versatility and superior performance, consistently outperforming fully centralized and distributed approaches across diverse system configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid centralized-distributed precoding strategy effectively balances fronthaul constraints and spectral efficiency requirements, providing a practical solution for fronthaul-limited cell-free massive MIMO systems.

Abstract: We investigate a fronthaul-limited cell-free massive multiple-input
multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system and propose a hybrid centralized-distributed
precoding strategy that dynamically adapts to varying fronthaul and spectral
efficiency (SE) requirements. The proposed approach divides users into two
groups: one served by centralized precoding and the other by distributed
precoding. We formulate a novel optimization problem for user grouping and
power control aimed at maximizing the sum SE, subject to fronthaul and
per-access point (AP) power constraints. To tackle the problem, we transform it
into a tractable form and propose efficient solution algorithms. Numerical
results confirm the hybrid scheme's versatility and superior performance,
consistently outperforming fully centralized and distributed approaches across
diverse system configurations.

### [201] [Phase Transitions of the Additive Uniform Noise Channel with Peak Amplitude and Cost Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12427)
*Jonas Stapmanns,Catarina Dias,Luke Eilers,Tobias Kühn,Jean-Pascal Pfister*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper determines optimal quantization conditions for additive uniform noise channels under peak amplitude and cost constraints, showing that concave cost functions lead to discrete input distributions while convex cost functions with active constraints result in continuous distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when quantization is optimal in communication systems with additive uniform noise, specifically examining how different cost function shapes and constraints affect the optimal input distribution.

Method: Analytical computation of capacity-achieving input distributions as functions of noise level, average cost constraint, and cost function curvature for additive uniform noise channels.

Result: Found that concave cost functions yield discrete capacity-achieving input distributions, while convex cost functions with active constraints produce continuous distributions spanning the entire interval. Derived analytical capacity expressions for discrete input cases.

Conclusion: The optimality of quantization depends on the curvature of the cost function - concave functions favor discrete inputs, while convex functions with binding constraints favor continuous inputs across the entire interval.

Abstract: Under which condition is quantization optimal? We address this question in
the context of the additive uniform noise channel under peak amplitude and cost
constraints. We compute analytically the capacity-achieving input distribution
as a function of the noise level, the average cost constraint, and the
curvature of the cost function. We find that when the cost function is concave,
the capacity-achieving input distribution is discrete, whereas when the cost
function is convex and the cost constraint is active, the support of the
capacity-achieving input distribution spans the entire interval. For the cases
of a discrete capacity-achieving input distribution, we derive the analytical
expressions for the capacity of the channel.

*Mohanad Obeed,Ming Jian*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: CoNet is a novel neural network architecture for OFDM receivers that uses multiple small subnetworks to process signal features from different perspectives, achieving better performance than traditional ResNets with reduced inference delay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DL-based OFDM receivers adapted from computer vision are computationally intensive, have high memory requirements and inference delays, and suffer performance degradation when network size is reduced for resource-constrained settings.

Method: CoNet uses multiple small ResNet or CNN subnetworks that simultaneously process signal features from different perspectives (e.g., capturing channel correlations and interference patterns), with their outputs fused through interaction operations like element-wise multiplication.

Result: Simulation results show CoNet significantly outperforms traditional ResNet architectures in bit error rate (BER) and reduces inference delay when both networks have the same size and computational complexity.

Conclusion: CoNet provides an effective neural network architecture for OFDM receivers that achieves superior detection performance while addressing the computational and latency limitations of existing DL-based approaches.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) based methods for orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) radio receivers demonstrated higher signal detection
performance compared to the traditional receivers. However, the existing
DL-based models, usually adapted from computer vision, aren't well suited for
wireless communications. These models require high computational resources and
memory, and have significant inference delays, limiting their use in
resource-constrained settings. Additionally, reducing network size to ease
resource demands often leads to notable performance degradation. This paper
introduces collaborative networks (CoNet), a novel neural network (NN)
architecture designed for OFDM receivers. CoNet uses multiple small ResNet or
CNN subnetworks to simultaneously process signal features from different
perspectives like capturing channel correlations and interference patterns.
These subnetworks fuse their outputs through interaction operations (e.g.,
element-wise multiplication), significantly enhancing detection performance.
Simulation results show CoNet significantly outperforms traditional
architectures like residual networks (ResNets) in bit error rate (BER) and
reduces inference delay when both nets have the same size and the same
computational complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate AI agents for culturally significant Dhumbal card game with imperfect information, and advance AI research while supporting digital preservation of cultural games.

Method: Implemented diverse AI strategies including rule-based (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced, Opportunistic), search-based (MCTS, ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning (DQN, PPO) approaches. Conducted within-category tournaments and cross-category championship with 1024 simulated rounds.

Result: Rule-based Aggressive agent achieved highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]), significantly outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%). Aggressive agent effectively exploited Jhyap declarations for superior performance.

Abstract: This study evaluates Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Dhumbal, a
culturally significant multiplayer card game with imperfect information,
through a systematic comparison of rule-based, search-based, and learning-based
strategies. We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents,
including heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced,
Opportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and
Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning
approaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments
followed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win
rate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk
assessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using
Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based
Aggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]),
outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of
Jhyap declarations. The study contributes a reproducible AI framework, insights
into heuristic efficacy under partial information, and open-source code,

### [204] [Beyond Consensus: Mitigating the Agreeableness Bias in LLM Judge Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11822)
*Suryaansh Jain,Umair Z. Ahmed,Shubham Sahai,Ben Leong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs as evaluators suffer from strong positive bias, being good at identifying valid outputs but poor at detecting invalid ones. The paper proposes minority-veto and regression-based methods to mitigate this bias, achieving significant improvements in evaluation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human evaluation of LLMs is costly and unscalable, while current LLM-as-a-judge approaches exhibit systematic positive bias that inflates reliability scores, making model selection decisions unreliable.

Method: Proposes two approaches: 1) optimal minority-veto strategy resilient to missing data, and 2) novel regression-based framework that directly models validator bias using small human-annotated ground truth data.

Result: On a code feedback task with 366 Python programs, the regression approach reduced maximum absolute error to 1.2%, achieving 2x improvement over best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively mitigate LLM evaluator bias, providing more reliable automated evaluation for model selection decisions without requiring extensive human annotation.

Abstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern
application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide
if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold
standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use
LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:
LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that
while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive
Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True
Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often
leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they
are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is
resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For
scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based
framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of
human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366
high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum
absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the
best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HAL (Holistic Agent Leaderboard) to address AI agent evaluation challenges through standardized evaluation harness, three-dimensional analysis, and LLM-aided log inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that undermine understanding of how well agents really work, with current evaluations often not reflecting real-world reliability.

Method: Three main contributions: 1) Standardized evaluation harness for parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, 2) Three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and benchmarks, 3) LLM-aided log inspection to uncover unreported behaviors.

Result: Conducted 21,730 agent rollouts across 9 models and 9 benchmarks in various domains with $40,000 cost. Found surprising insights like higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in most runs, and uncovered problematic behaviors like searching for benchmarks instead of solving tasks.

Conclusion: HAL aims to shift focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real world by standardizing evaluation methods and addressing common pitfalls.

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates
agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the
focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real
world.

*Owen Queen,Harrison G. Zhang,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CGBench is a new benchmark for evaluating language models' ability to interpret scientific publications in clinical genetics, testing extraction, evidence assessment, and categorization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional variant and gene interpretation methods are manual and labor-intensive. Generative language models can accelerate translation of research into clinical insights, but existing benchmarks focus on narrow tasks not applicable to real-world research.

Method: Built CGBench from ClinGen expert-curated literature interpretations. Tests 8 different LMs on three capabilities: extracting experimental results following protocols, judging evidence strength, and categorizing experiment outcomes.

Result: Models show promise but have substantial gaps in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions. Reasoning models excel at fine-grained tasks while non-reasoning models are better at high-level interpretations. LM explanations often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying evidence.

Conclusion: CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise scientific publication interpretation, opening avenues for future AI research in clinical genetics and broader science applications.

Abstract: Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and
translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and
labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process,
accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable
insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities
of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks
that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we
introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs
on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of
expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench
measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following
precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3)
categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8
different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist
in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions.
Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are
better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations
against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models
often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying
evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise
interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research
in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

### [207] [Asking Clarifying Questions for Preference Elicitation With Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12015)
*Ali Montazeralghaem,Guy Tennenholtz,Craig Boutilier,Ofer Meshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel method for training LLMs to ask sequential clarifying questions to elicit user preferences in recommendation systems, inspired by diffusion models with forward and reverse processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs enable conversational recommendation systems but need effective ways to elicit user preferences, especially with limited history. Generating sequential clarifying questions across domains remains challenging.

Method: Two-stage process inspired by diffusion models: forward process generates questions and removes answers (adding noise to user profile), reverse process trains model to denoise profile by learning to ask effective clarifying questions.

Result: The method significantly improves LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions and effectively eliciting user preferences.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enhances LLMs' ability to ask sequential clarifying questions for better user preference elicitation in recommendation systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems
to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to
personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially
when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to
present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective
sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To
address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential
questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process
inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process
generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers
step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The
reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by
learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our
method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions
and eliciting user preferences effectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalTrace is a neurosymbolic causal analysis module integrated into SmartPilot industrial CoPilot that combines data-driven causal analysis with industrial ontologies for transparent, explainable decision support in manufacturing environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern manufacturing needs both accurate predictions and interpretable insights for process anomalies, root causes, and interventions. Existing AI systems function as isolated black boxes lacking integration of prediction, explanation, and causal reasoning, limiting trustworthiness in high-stakes industrial environments.

Method: CausalTrace performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and knowledge graphs, supporting causal discovery, counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It integrates with SmartPilot industrial CoPilot and supports real-time operator interaction.

Result: In academic rocket assembly testbed: achieved substantial agreement with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA), strong RCA performance (MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92), and attained 4.59/5 in C3AN evaluation demonstrating precision and reliability for live deployment.

Conclusion: CausalTrace successfully integrates neurosymbolic causal analysis with industrial systems, providing transparent and explainable decision support that bridges the gap between AI predictions and practical industrial utility while maintaining high performance and reliability.

Abstract: Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but
also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential
interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes,
lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal
reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation
limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial
environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal
analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace
performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and
knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,
counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time
operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering
transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN
framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration),
which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an
academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement
with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance
(MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in
the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live

*Soohan Lim,Joonghyuk Hahn,Hyunwoo Park,Sang-Ki Ko,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PACT is a framework that evaluates LLM-generated code for both functional correctness and contract adherence, addressing limitations in existing benchmarks that ignore how code handles ill-formed inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code generation benchmarks like HumanEval+ and MBPP+ only evaluate functional correctness with well-formed inputs, ignoring contract adherence - how code handles ill-formed inputs and rejects invalid ones, which is crucial for real-world software reliability.

Method: PACT extends HumanEval+ and MBPP+ with contract-violating test cases, enables systematic analysis under different prompting conditions, and introduces novel metrics to quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation.

Result: The analysis shows that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases significantly improves models' ability to respect contracts compared to using contract descriptions alone, revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook.

Conclusion: PACT provides rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of LLM-generated code in both functionality and contract-adherence, bridging a critical gap in current code generation evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+,
primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional
correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of
real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity
constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical
oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models
consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We
introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation
framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to
systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code
snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:
First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract
violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic
analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis
demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases
significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using
contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously
quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By
revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides
the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of
LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our

*Yiheng Chen,Lingyao Li,Zihui Ma,Qikai Hu,Yilun Zhu,Min Deng,Runlong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL) that integrates geospatial data with LLMs to improve disaster response by providing evidence-based resource allocation recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing statistical approaches for disaster response lack semantic context, generalize poorly across events, and offer limited interpretability. LLMs provide few-shot generalization but remain text-bound and blind to geography.

Method: GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure, demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases, assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation recommendations.

Result: Evaluation in real wildfire scenarios across multiple LLM models shows that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines. The framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and hurricanes.

Conclusion: The proposed GAL framework successfully bridges the gap between LLMs and geospatial data, enabling more effective and evidence-based disaster response recommendations that outperform traditional approaches.

Abstract: Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.
Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly
across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models
(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to
geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)
that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire
detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,
demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,
assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched
context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation
recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further
reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental
updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple
LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.
The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and
hurricanes.

TL;DR: ThinkPilot is a training-free framework that uses evolutionary algorithms to generate think-prefixes that optimize Large Reasoning Models' reasoning behaviors, improving efficiency, safety, and instruction following.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models suffer from inefficient and off-target reasoning, and current training-free methods are limited to rigid heuristics or non-actionable analyses.

Method: Uses an evolutionary process to generate think-prefixes driven by a taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.

Result: Significantly improves accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning, drastically improves safety (cutting StrongREJECT score from 27.0% to 0.7), enhances instruction following, and synergizes with existing training-based methods.

Conclusion: Think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning behaviors, and different tasks have strong preferences for specific behavioral distributions, providing a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs reasoning with task demands.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

### [212] [AI Agents as Universal Task Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12066)
*Alessandro Achille,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents can be viewed as universal computers through transductive learning, where the key is optimizing time rather than model size or data, and scaling should focus on reducing computation time rather than just improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if AI reasoning agents can be universal computers, how they learn to reason, and whether scaling model size or data is the key factor in achieving intelligence.

Method: Reinterpret AI agents as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, propose transductive learning to capture algorithmic structure from past data, and analyze the relationship between information and time reduction.

Result: Optimal speed-up is tied to algorithmic information, theoretical derivation for power-law scaling of inference time vs training time, and showing that infinite scaling can lead to savant-like behavior without true intelligence.

Conclusion: The key to scaling reasoning models should be optimizing time rather than model size or accuracy, as time plays a critical role in learning that has been overlooked.

Abstract: AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying
tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In
doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --
there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI
agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?
How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training
dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI
Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and
highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.
In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to
transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the
distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce
the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role
of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than
reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a
universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their
algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the
observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show
that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on
benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone
super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can
behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.
Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning
models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly

### [213] [HiCoTraj:Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12067)
*Junyi Xie,Yuankun Jiao,Jina Kim,Yao-Yi Chiang,Lingyi Zhao,Khurram Shafique*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiCoTraj is a zero-shot framework that uses hierarchical chain-of-thought prompting with LLMs to infer demographic attributes from mobility patterns without labeled training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobility-based demographic inference methods rely on large labeled datasets, leading to poor interpretability and limited generalizability across datasets and user groups.

Method: Transforms trajectories into natural language representations (activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries), then uses hierarchical chain-of-thought reasoning through three stages: factual feature extraction, behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference.

Result: Achieves competitive performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios on real-world trajectory data.

Conclusion: HiCoTraj addresses labeled data scarcity while providing transparent reasoning chains, enabling demographic inference without training data through LLMs' semantic understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human
mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health
interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation
services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on
large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited
interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user
groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical
Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'
zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform
demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms
trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by
creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then
HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically
guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,
behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.
This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data
while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on
real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive
performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.

*Zixing Lei,Sheng Yin,Yichen Xiong,Yuanzhuo Ding,Wenhao Huang,Yuxi Wei,Qingyao Xu,Yiming Li,Weixin Li,Yunhong Wang,Siheng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EmboMatrix is a training ground infrastructure that enables LLMs to acquire embodied decision-making skills through simulation, interaction, and feedback, resulting in EmboBrain-7B outperforming much larger models on embodied benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs trained only on language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied understanding needed for general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Method: Created EmboMatrix training ground with multi-agent data engine for task/scene generation, distributed heterogeneous-hardware system for scalable simulation, and multi-level reward architecture for precise supervision.

Result: EmboBrain-7B surpasses 671B DeepSeek-R1 baseline by 9.5% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks.

Conclusion: Interactive, environment-grounded learning is powerful for building truly intelligent embodied agents, demonstrating that embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied interactions.

Abstract: Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into
executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world,
forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language
models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a
promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on
language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied
understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground:
a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation,
embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for
LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present
EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and
diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix
incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for
large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware
system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for
precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM
whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied
interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1
baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks,
demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for
building truly intelligent embodied agents.

### [215] [BeSTAD: Behavior-Aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human Mobility Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12076)
*Junyi Xie,Jina Kim,Yao-Yi Chiang,Lingyi Zhao,Khurram Shafique*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BeSTAD is an unsupervised framework for detecting individual-level anomalies in human mobility by learning personalized behavioral signatures and identifying deviations from normal patterns through spatio-temporal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anomaly detection focuses on trajectory-level analysis, but detecting individual-level anomalies within large populations remains challenging. There's a need to identify unusual deviations in a person's mobility behavior relative to their own historical patterns.

Method: BeSTAD learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location meaning and temporal patterns. It employs behavior-cluster-aware modeling to build personalized behavioral profiles from normal activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison with semantic alignment.

Result: The framework enables detection of subtle deviations in individual movement behavior, behavioral shifts, deviations from established routines, and identification of individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets.

Conclusion: By learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis, overcoming limitations of traditional trajectory-level approaches.

Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on
trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal
inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting
individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility
behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets
encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,
we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized
behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained
anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD
learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location
meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in
individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware
modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal
activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison
with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior
clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts
and deviations from established routines but also the identification of
individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By
learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances
anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

### [216] [Evaluating the Quality of Randomness and Entropy in Tasks Supported by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12080)
*Rabimba Karanjai,Yang Lu,Ranjith Chodavarapu,Lei Xu,Weidong Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show inconsistent performance in handling randomness-related tasks like generating random numbers, passwords, and shuffling items, often deviating from expected behavior despite some degree of randomness in outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in applications requiring randomness (stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, cryptography), it's unclear how well they can handle random number generation and utilization.

Method: Conducted experiments considering factors like external tool accessibility, task types, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and prompting strategies. Tasks included random number/string generation, shuffling, and randomness evaluation using entropy and NIST test-suite.

Result: LLMs can generate outputs with some randomness but performance is inconsistent and significantly deviates from expected behavior across various randomness tasks.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have key limitations in handling randomness effectively, highlighting areas needing improvement for reliable use in randomness-dependent applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to
diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as
stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and
cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling
randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers
effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for
handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We
designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence
an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to
external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and
prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including
generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,
shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the
NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate
outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is
inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The
analysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where
improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving
randomness

*Zaid Khan,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Jaemin Cho,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OneLife framework learns symbolic world models in complex stochastic environments with minimal interaction data using conditionally-activated programmatic laws within probabilistic programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of learning in complex, stochastic environments where agents have only "one life" to explore without human guidance, unlike prior work focused on deterministic environments with abundant data.

Method: Uses conditionally-activated programmatic laws with precondition-effect structure within probabilistic programming framework, creating dynamic computation graphs that route inference only through relevant laws to handle complex hierarchical states.

Result: Outperforms strong baseline on 16 out of 23 scenarios in Crafter-OO environment, successfully learns key environment dynamics from minimal unguided interaction, and demonstrates planning ability through simulated rollouts identifying superior strategies.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown, complex environments, enabling learning of stochastic dynamics even with sparse rule activation.

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers
through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models
(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both
interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer

executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report
Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined
autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for
iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution
from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case

condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its
potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of
interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of
grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling
natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers

*Rongzhi Zhang,Liqin Ye,Yuzhao Heng,Xiang Chen,Tong Yu,Lingkai Kong,Sudheer Chava,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method for precise attribute intensity control in LLMs that enables fine-grained, continuous control over attribute intensities beyond simple directional alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods only provide directional or open-ended guidance, failing to reliably achieve exact attribute intensities needed for AI systems adaptable to diverse user expectations.

Method: Three key designs: (1) reformulating control as target-reaching problem, (2) training lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict attribute scores from partial generations, and (3) using gradient-based interventions on hidden representations to navigate toward specific targets.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini show high accuracy in steering text generation to user-specified attribute intensities, with efficiency enhancements in preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier optimization, and distillation of aligned behaviors.

Conclusion: The method enables fine-grained continuous control over attribute intensities and demonstrates practical applications across multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

Motivation: To address the underexplored reasoning capabilities of LLMs in materials science and provide a structured benchmark for evaluation.

Method: Created a structured taxonomy with difficulty classification, included multimodal reasoning with visual contexts, and evaluated various reasoning strategies including chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction.

Result: Even the best model (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieved under 80% accuracy, showing the benchmark's complexity. No single reasoning method consistently excelled across all scenarios.

Conclusion: MatSciBench establishes a comprehensive benchmark for assessing and improving LLMs' scientific reasoning capabilities in materials science, highlighting current limitations and areas for development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
scientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science
remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a
comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the
essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a
structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science
questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier
difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each
question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise
error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in
numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the
highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on
college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of
MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic
chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no
single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze
performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and
accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,
analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the
influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a
comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the
scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.

parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We
first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B
parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and
Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,
instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and
analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark
results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive review of 65 user studies on Explainable AI (XAI) systems, focusing on human-centered evaluation metrics and design goals tailored to users with different AI expertise levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI becomes more common, there's increasing demand for systems that are both performant and understandable. Current XAI evaluation processes are too technical and not sufficiently focused on human user needs, necessitating better user study guidelines.

Method: Conducted a comprehensive review of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains, analyzing system characteristics and human-centered evaluation metrics.

Result: Key findings include: distinction between core system and XAI explanation as components; categorization of evaluation metrics into affection, cognition, usability, interpretability, and explanation metrics; and tailored design goals for AI novices (responsible use, acceptance, usability) vs data experts (performance, human-AI collaboration, task performance).

Conclusion: The paper provides an extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks, offering holistic guidelines for human-centered XAI system development that accounts for users' specific characteristics and AI expertise levels.

Abstract: As AI becomes more common in everyday living, there is an increasing demand
for intelligent systems that are both performant and understandable.
Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of
decisions and predictions. At present, however, evaluation processes are rather
technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users.
Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable
guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and
application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic
overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on
human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered
design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific
characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI
expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an
extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of
our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important
finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,
which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction
of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,
interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with
their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices,
the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and
usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes
human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GOAT is a training framework that enables fine-tuning of LLM agents for goal-oriented API execution tasks without human annotation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents struggle with goal-oriented queries that require decomposing objectives into interdependent API calls, and smaller open-source models perform poorly compared to proprietary models like GPT-4.

Method: GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets from API documents and fine-tunes LLM agents to reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses in a human annotation-free setting.

Result: GOAT-trained agents achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple goal-oriented benchmarks and also excel on the new GOATBench benchmark.

Conclusion: GOAT provides a practical path toward building robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional
text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools
based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to
handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective
into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution.
Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of
training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate
strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform
complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT,
which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting.
GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution
tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to
reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through
extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks.
In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution
benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this
setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building
robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

*Yuechun Yu,Han Ying,Haoan Jin,Wenjian Jiang,Dong Xian,Binghao Wang,Zhou Yang,Mengyue Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedKGEval is a multi-turn evaluation framework for clinical LLMs that uses knowledge graph-driven patient simulation and in-situ turn-level assessment to capture the dynamic nature of medical dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM evaluation methods in medicine rely on post hoc transcript review, neglecting the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of real clinical interactions and evolving patient needs.

Method: The framework uses: (1) knowledge graph-driven patient simulation with a control module retrieving medical facts, (2) in-situ turn-level evaluation by a Judge Agent assessing clinical appropriateness, factual correctness, and safety, (3) integration of open-source resources with expert-annotated data for knowledge graph construction.

Result: Comprehensive benchmark of eight state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrated MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle behavioral flaws and safety risks overlooked by conventional evaluation methods.

Conclusion: MedKGEval provides a robust framework for evaluating clinical LLMs in dynamic medical dialogues, with extensibility to multiple languages through knowledge graph switching, ensuring bilingual support and domain-specific applicability.

Abstract: The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical
applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the
complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real
clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc
review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,
context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational
needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn
evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical
knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge
graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module
retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby
endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational
behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source
resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)
an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is

### [226] [PromptFlow: Training Prompts Like Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12246)
*Jingyi Wang,Hongyuan Zhu,Ye Niu,Yunhui Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PromptFlow is a modular framework for automated prompt engineering that uses meta-learning and reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize prompts for LLMs across diverse NLP tasks, reducing manual effort and improving adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generic LLMs underperform on specialized domains, manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive, and current automated methods lack dynamic strategy selection and fine-grained prompt editing capabilities.

Method: Proposed PromptFlow framework with meta-prompts, operators, optimization, and evaluator modules. Uses gradient-based meta-learning and reinforcement learning to autonomously explore optimal prompt refinement trajectories.

Result: Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PromptFlow in improving LLM performance across different NLP tasks.

Conclusion: PromptFlow provides an efficient automated prompt engineering solution that requires minimal task-specific data and effectively adapts LLMs to diverse domains through dynamic prompt optimization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across
diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic
models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent
advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive
retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task
objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for
model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains
labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring
iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this
limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to
systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations
predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic
strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task
requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at
each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity.
At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is
still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training
framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators,
optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest
optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement
trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal
task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning
method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
PromptFlow.

### [227] [$\mathbf{T^3}$: Reducing Belief Deviation in Reinforcement Learning for Active Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12264)
*Deyu Zou,Yongqiang Chen,Jianxiang Wang,Haochen Yang,Mufei Li,James Cheng,Pan Li,Yu Gong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T³ is a method that detects belief deviation in LLM-based agents during active reasoning and truncates uninformative trajectory tails to improve policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents suffer from belief deviation during active reasoning, leading to uninformative actions and compounding errors that hinder reinforcement learning training.

Method: Track belief deviation and truncate trajectories during training when excessive deviation is detected, preserving credit for informative prefixes while removing uninformative tails.

Result: Across 5 challenging tasks, T³ improved training stability, token efficiency, and final performance by up to 30% while reducing rollout tokens by ~25%.

Conclusion: Belief control is a key principle for developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

Abstract: Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.
Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent
understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the
solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents
often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,
lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive
actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)
training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address
this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop
$\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief
deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative
tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$
systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,
$\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and
final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by
roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for
developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

### [228] [Tensor Logic: The Language of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12269)
*Pedro Domingos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes tensor logic, a new programming language that unifies neural and symbolic AI by treating logical rules and Einstein summation as the same operation through tensor equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow lack support for automated reasoning and knowledge acquisition, while traditional AI languages like LISP and Prolog lack scalability and learning capabilities, creating a fundamental gap in AI programming.

Method: Tensor logic uses tensor equations as its sole construct, unifying logical rules with Einstein summation operations. This allows implementation of neural networks, formal reasoning, kernel machines, and graphical models within a single framework.

Result: The approach enables elegant implementation of key AI forms and opens new directions like sound reasoning in embedding space, combining neural network scalability with symbolic reasoning reliability.

Conclusion: Tensor logic potentially provides a basis for wider AI adoption by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a fundamental level, addressing current limitations in AI programming languages.

Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the
requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic
differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,
which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning
and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts
to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack
scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a
language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a
fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,
based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are
essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how
to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in
tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and
graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,
such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and
learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of
symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

*Zirui Guo,Xubin Ren,Lingrui Xu,Jiahao Zhang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAG-Anything is a unified framework that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities (text, images, tables, math), addressing the limitation of existing RAG systems that only handle text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems are limited to textual content while real-world knowledge repositories are inherently multimodal, creating fundamental gaps when processing documents with visual elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions.

Method: The framework reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge entities using dual-graph construction to capture cross-modal relationships and textual semantics. It employs cross-modal hybrid retrieval combining structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching.

Result: RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on challenging multimodal benchmarks with significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly on long documents where traditional approaches fail.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural fragmentation that constrains current systems and enabling effective reasoning over heterogeneous content spanning multiple modalities.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a
new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural
fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced

### [230] [O-Forge: An LLM + Computer Algebra Framework for Asymptotic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12350)
*Ayush Khaitan,Vijay Ganesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM+CAS framework combines frontier LLMs with computer algebra systems to produce creative and verified proofs for asymptotic inequalities through symbolic feedback loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of LLMs in research mathematics by providing rigorous verification of proofs, particularly for difficult asymptotic inequalities that require appropriate domain decompositions.

Method: Uses an In-Context Symbolic Feedback loop where LLMs suggest domain decompositions and CAS (like Mathematica) provides axiomatic verification of each piece, creating a collaborative proof system.

Result: The framework proves remarkably effective at proposing correct domain decompositions and answering Terry Tao's question about AI's ability to help prove intricate asymptotic inequalities.

Conclusion: LLM+CAS demonstrates how AI can move beyond contest mathematics to become research-level tools for professional mathematicians by combining creativity with rigorous verification.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in
solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has
remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs
may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present
a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples
frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic
Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically
verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves
difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right"
subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using
AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns
out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a
combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to
suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a
verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question
posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help
prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move
beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional
mathematicians.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey provides the first comprehensive review of Vibe Coding with LLMs, establishing theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this AI-driven development approach where developers validate implementations through outcome observation rather than code comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of LLMs has enabled autonomous coding agents, creating a new "Vibe Coding" paradigm, but its effectiveness remains under-explored with empirical evidence showing productivity losses and human-AI collaboration challenges.

Method: Systematic analysis of over 1000 research papers to survey the Vibe Coding ecosystem, formalizing it through a Constrained Markov Decision Process and synthesizing practices into five distinct development models.

Result: Established the first comprehensive taxonomy of Vibe Coding models: Unconstrained Automation, Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and Context-Enhanced Models. Revealed that success depends on systematic context engineering, development environments, and human-agent collaboration.

Conclusion: Vibe Coding represents a transformative development approach where successful implementation requires not just agent capabilities but systematic context engineering, established development environments, and collaborative human-agent models.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a
novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate
AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than
line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the
effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical
evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in
human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first
comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,
establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this
transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over
1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining
critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding
agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We
first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a
Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic
relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.
Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing
practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,
Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and
Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in
this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding
depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering,
well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative
development models.

*Yunuo Liu,Dawei Zhu,Zena Al-Khalili,Dai Cheng,Yanjun Chen,Dietrich Klakow,Wei Zhang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PricingLogic is the first benchmark testing LLMs' ability to automate tourism pricing with complex fare rules, revealing significant reliability issues despite general AI capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Travel agencies want to automate error-prone pricing tasks using AI, but unverified LLM deployment could cause financial losses and damage customer trust.

Method: Created 300 natural-language questions from 42 real pricing policies, with two difficulty levels: basic customer-type pricing and complex bundled-tour calculations with interacting discounts.

Result: LLMs show steep performance drop on harder tier, exposing systematic failures in rule interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.

Conclusion: Current LLMs remain unreliable for revenue-critical applications without additional safeguards or domain adaptation, despite their general capabilities.

Abstract: We present PricingLogic, the first benchmark that probes whether Large
Language Models(LLMs) can reliably automate tourism-related prices when
multiple, overlapping fare rules apply. Travel agencies are eager to offload
this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified
reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer
trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking
requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of
difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations
involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep
performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule
interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite
their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical
applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/PricingLogic.

### [233] [MTOS: A LLM-Driven Multi-topic Opinion Simulation Framework for Exploring Echo Chamber Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12423)
*Dingyi Zuo,Hongjie Zhang,Jie Ou,Chaosheng Feng,Shuwan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MTOS is a multi-topic opinion simulation framework that uses LLMs to model opinion dynamics across interrelated topics, addressing limitations of single-topic approaches and traditional numerical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing opinion simulation studies focus on single topics and lack the ability to capture cognitive transfer across multiple topics, while traditional numerical models oversimplify linguistic attitudes and lack interpretability.

Method: MTOS integrates LLMs with short-term/long-term memory, multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms, dynamic topic-selection strategies, and belief decay mechanisms to enable perspective updates across topics.

Result: Multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit them, and irrelevant topics mitigate echo chambers through resource competition. LLM-based agents realistically simulate opinion changes and improve interpretability.

Conclusion: MTOS successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches by enabling realistic simulation of opinion dynamics across multiple topics, capturing complex human reasoning and improving system stability compared to traditional numerical models.

Abstract: The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases
on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world
networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing
challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that
simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language
models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive
transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,
meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking
interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple
topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation
(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with
LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,
incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic
topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable
perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,
varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to
assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show
that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively
correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit
them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource
competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically
simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts,
and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and
system stability.

*Chengyang Dong,Nan Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A deep reinforcement learning framework with biased attention mechanism for autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections, using SAC algorithm with traffic risk prediction for improved safety and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high collision risks, requiring proactive safety control.

Method: Proposes a DRL framework based on Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm integrated with biased attention mechanism to construct traffic risk predictor that assesses long-term collision risk and transforms it into dense reward signals.

Result: Simulation results show the method effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at intersections, demonstrating effectiveness in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed intelligent decision-making framework with biased attention mechanism proves effective for safe and efficient autonomous driving at unsignalized intersections.

Abstract: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly
challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To
achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention
mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic
risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a
vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward
signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions.
Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the
intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent
decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is
available at https://github.com/hank111525/SAC-RWB.

*Jiaxin Gao,Chen Chen,Yanwen Jia,Xueluan Gong,Kwok-Yan Lam,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM judges show robustness to biased inputs but fine-tuning on biased data degrades performance. Scoring correlates with task difficulty, and mitigation strategies are proposed for fair AI judging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate biases in LLM-as-a-judge models used in communication systems, as impartiality is crucial for user trust and fair outcomes.

Method: Systematically examined 11 types of biases in GPT-Judge and JudgeLM models under point-wise scoring, tested robustness to biased inputs, and evaluated effects of fine-tuning on biased data.

Result: LLM judges are robust to biased inputs (assign lower scores), detailed rubrics enhance robustness, fine-tuning on biased data degrades performance, and scores correlate with task difficulty.

Conclusion: LLM judges have inherent biases that need mitigation strategies for reliable use in practical communication scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously
evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess
responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of
these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation
criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we
systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,
GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11
types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that
state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally
assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a
detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that
fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly
degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We
also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a
challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an
open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.
Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and
reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.

*Rui Reis,Pedro Rangel Henriques,João Ferreira-Coimbra,Eva Oliveira,Nuno F. Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A task-oriented dialogue framework using DAG structure for medical interviews, featuring cold-start questioning, adaptive branching, automated report generation, and validated through usability testing with physicians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an efficient medical dialogue system that transforms clinical guidelines into structured interviews, reduces cognitive workload for both patients and physicians, and integrates seamlessly into clinical workflows.

Method: DAG-based dialogue framework with: systematic pipeline for guideline transformation, hierarchical clustering for cold-start questioning, expand-and-prune mechanism for adaptive branching, termination logic, and automated structured report generation.

Result: Patient app: low workload (NASA-TLX=15.6), high usability (SUS=86), strong satisfaction (QUIS=8.1/9). Physician app: moderate workload (NASA-TLX=26), excellent usability (SUS=88.5), satisfaction 8.3/9. Both effectively integrated into clinical workflows.

Conclusion: The framework successfully reduces cognitive demand and supports efficient clinical reporting, though limited by occasional latency and small evaluation sample.

Abstract: We developed a task-oriented dialogue framework structured as a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) of medical questions. The system integrates: (1) a
systematic pipeline for transforming medical algorithms and guidelines into a
clinical question corpus; (2) a cold-start mechanism based on hierarchical
clustering to generate efficient initial questioning without prior patient
information; (3) an expand-and-prune mechanism enabling adaptive branching and
backtracking based on patient responses; (4) a termination logic to ensure
interviews end once sufficient information is gathered; and (5) automated
synthesis of doctor-friendly structured reports aligned with clinical
workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the
patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five
physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the
System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface
Satisfaction (QUIS). The patient application achieved low workload scores
(NASA-TLX = 15.6), high usability (SUS = 86), and strong satisfaction (QUIS =
8.1/9), with particularly high ratings for ease of learning and interface
design. The physician application yielded moderate workload (NASA-TLX = 26) and
excellent usability (SUS = 88.5), with satisfaction scores of 8.3/9. Both
applications demonstrated effective integration into clinical workflows,
reducing cognitive demand and supporting efficient report generation.
Limitations included occasional system latency and a small, non-diverse
evaluation sample.

*Chengpeng Hu,Calvin Yu-Chian Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIVCs learn executable cell state models from multimodal data, but face challenges in cross-lab transport, data leakage, and cross-scale coupling. A CSL framework with operator grammar is proposed to address these issues through better evaluation and data design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIVC evaluations are limited to single datasets and settings, with poor transport across labs/platforms, data leakage issues, and inadequate handling of dose/time/combination effects. Cross-scale coupling is constrained and alignment to scientific/clinical readouts varies.

Method: Proposes a model-agnostic Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective with operator grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention for dosing/scheduling. Emphasizes decision-aligned evaluation across modality, scale, context and intervention.

Result: The framework enables reproducible, like-for-like comparisons through operator-aware data design, leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration/reporting. Focuses on function-space readouts like pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods, and clinical endpoints.

Conclusion: The CSL perspective with operator grammar provides a systematic approach to address current limitations in AIVC evaluation and cross-scale coupling, promoting better decision-aligned models and reproducible comparisons.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable,
decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale
measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation
models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and
explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is
standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and
settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms
is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage
bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically
handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking
molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific
or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic
Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator
grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention
for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation
blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes
function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and
clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design,
leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to
enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.

*Utsav Kumar Nareti,Suraj Kumar,Soumya Pandey,Soumi Chattopadhyay,Chandranath Adak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProtoSiTex is a semi-interpretable framework for fine-grained multi-label text classification that uses dual-phase training with prototype discovery and hierarchical loss to provide human-aligned explanations while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing prototype-based models that operate at coarse granularity (sentence/document level) and fail to handle multi-label classification in real-world scenarios with user-generated reviews.

Method: Uses dual-phase alternating training: unsupervised prototype discovery for semantically coherent prototypes, and supervised classification mapping prototypes to labels. Employs hierarchical loss across sub-sentence, sentence, and document levels, with adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention for overlapping semantics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on a new hotel review benchmark dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and multi-class), while providing faithful, human-aligned explanations.

Conclusion: ProtoSiTex establishes itself as a robust solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification, effectively capturing fine-grained insights with interpretable explanations.

Abstract: The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable
models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models
offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity
(sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of
real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable
framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex
employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype
discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a
supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A
hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,
and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior
approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using
adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark
dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple
labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and
multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust
solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent reinforcement learning framework using genetic similarity and inclusive fitness rewards to model biological evolution dynamics in social games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simulate natural selection's competitive and cooperative forces in AI by modeling genetic relationships and inclusive fitness, inspired by biological evolution.

Method: Gene-based multi-agent reinforcement learning where agents have genotypes and receive inclusive fitness rewards based on genetic similarity, tested in prisoner's dilemma network games.

Result: Social dynamics aligned with Hamilton's rule from biology, with emergent cooperation patterns based on genetic similarity rather than binary team structures.

Conclusion: Inclusive fitness-based rewards enable complex social dynamics and strategic arms races, providing foundation for more socially intelligent agents.

Abstract: The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the
evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast
biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we
propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent
is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the
concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with
other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We
study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with
prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established
principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how
this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and
temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize
the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a
gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively
producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In
contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our
gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from
full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling
unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual
cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents
behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive
fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically
advanced and socially intelligent agents.

### [240] [HardcoreLogic: Challenging Large Reasoning Models with Long-tail Logic Puzzle Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12563)
*Jingcong Liang,Shijun Wan,Xuehai Wu,Siyuan Wang,Yitong Li,Qianglong Chen,Duyu Tang,Zhongyu Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HardcoreLogic is a challenging benchmark of 5,000+ puzzles across 10 games designed to test LRMs' robustness on non-canonical logical game variants through systematic transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing corpora focus on canonical puzzle formats (like 9x9 Sudoku), risking overfitting and memorization that masks deficiencies in understanding novel rules or adapting to new variants.

Method: Systematically transforms canonical puzzles through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE), and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP) to reduce reliance on shortcut memorization.

Result: Evaluations show significant performance drops even for top-performing models on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy reliance on memorized stereotypes. Increased complexity is the dominant difficulty source, but models also struggle with subtle rule variations.

Conclusion: HardcoreLogic exposes limitations of current LRMs and establishes a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning, highlighting gaps in genuine reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions
satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply
appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with
non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus
on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats
and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in
understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address
this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles
across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of
logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles
through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE),
and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization.
Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even
for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy
reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant
source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do
not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on
solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.
Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes
a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

### [241] [Memory as Action: Autonomous Context Curation for Long-Horizon Agentic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12635)
*Yuxiang Zhang,Jiangming Shu,Ye Ma,Xueyuan Lin,Shangxi Wu,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Memory-as-Action framework where LLMs actively manage working memory through explicit editing operations as part of a unified policy, enabling joint optimization of task reasoning and memory management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long-horizon tasks due to constrained memory being overwhelmed by irrelevant context, and existing memory methods use external heuristics decoupled from core policy.

Method: Memory-as-Action framework with explicit memory editing operations, trained via Dynamic Context Policy Optimization algorithm that handles trajectory fractures from non-prefix memory changes.

Result: Joint optimization reduces computational consumption and improves task performance through adaptive context curation strategies tailored to the model's capabilities.

Conclusion: Reframing working memory management as a learnable intrinsic capability enables more effective long-horizon reasoning by balancing memory curation with task objectives.

Abstract: Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their
constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context.
Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic
mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we
reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We
propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages
its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a
unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement
learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under
given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the
standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,
leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt
the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making
those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,
Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end
reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and
applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our
results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory
management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational
consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context
curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ERA is a two-stage framework that combines prior knowledge learning and online RL to create efficient embodied AI agents. It uses three types of priors and specialized RL techniques to outperform large models like GPT-4o while being more deployable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between costly large-scale VLMs and underperforming smaller models in embodied AI, enabling efficient deployment of capable agents in complex environments.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Embodied Prior Learning with three types of priors (trajectory-augmented, environment-anchored, external knowledge), 2) Online RL with self-summarization, dense reward shaping, and turn-level policy optimization.

Result: ERA-3B achieves 8.4% improvement on EB-ALFRED and 19.4% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, with strong generalization to unseen tasks, outperforming both prompting-based large models and previous training-based baselines.

Conclusion: ERA provides a practical path toward scalable embodied intelligence with methodological insights for future embodied AI systems, demonstrating that smaller models can outperform large ones through strategic knowledge integration and RL optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language
models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in
complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale
models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary
knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present
\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates
prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first
stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from
three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing
trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)
Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and
grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer
general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we
develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance
agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including
long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key
designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and
turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level
planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate
that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous
training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of
8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits
strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path
toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for
future embodied AI systems.

### [243] [Multi-Agent Debate for LLM Judges with Adaptive Stability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12697)
*Tianyu Hu,Zhen Tan,Song Wang,Huaizhi Qu,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent debate framework for LLM-based judgment tasks that improves accuracy over majority voting through collaborative reasoning and adaptive stopping based on consensus dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-Judge approaches rely on simplistic aggregation methods like majority voting, which can fail even when individual agents provide correct answers, highlighting the need for more sophisticated collaborative reasoning.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and iteratively refine responses, with mathematical formalization of debate process and stability detection via time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture modeling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for adaptive stopping.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate improved judgment accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The multi-agent debate framework successfully enhances LLM judgment capabilities by leveraging collaborative reasoning and dynamic consensus modeling, providing a more robust alternative to static ensemble methods.

Abstract: With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer
promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic
aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when
individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a
multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and
iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process
mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies
correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a
stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a
time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the
judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of
Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across
multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment
accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Mattia Grasselli,Angelo Porrello,Carlo Augusto Grazia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAMNet uses Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) for vehicle trajectory prediction, showing promising results despite limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety concerns in autonomous driving by overcoming sensor limitations (field of view obstructions) through vehicle-to-vehicle communication using CAMs.

Method: Design and train CAMNet neural network on motion forecasting dataset, then evaluate on custom CAM dataset to test data effectiveness.

Result: Promising results demonstrate CAMs can support vehicle trajectory prediction, though with some limitations.

Conclusion: CAM data shows potential for trajectory prediction but has limitations that present opportunities for future research.

Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety
concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as
LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these
sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be
obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this
context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables
cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are
occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness
Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle
trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,
Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely
used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset
that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to
assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach
demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle
trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the
approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.

TL;DR: Proposes a self-supervised learning approach with graph-theoretical techniques for improved OOD detection without labeled data, achieving AUROC=0.99.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance AI robustness in safety-critical systems by improving OOD detection capabilities without requiring labeled data.

Method: Combines self-supervised learning for representation learning from unlabeled data with graph-theoretical techniques for OOD sample identification.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with AUROC=0.99, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves OOD detection and enhances AI system robustness without labeled data requirements.

Abstract: Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and
accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial
in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or
healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper
proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data,
thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages
the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful
representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical
techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization
of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach
achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) =
0.99.

*Myles Foley,Sergio Maffeis,Muhammad Fakhrur Rozi,Takeshi Takahashi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLUTCH is a novel deep combinatorial bandit approach that improves JavaScript fuzzing efficiency by using attention mechanisms and Concrete Dropout to intelligently select mutation targets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing JavaScript fuzzing techniques use random selection for mutation targets, which is inefficient. The problem of selecting better mutation targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with volatile arms.

Method: Propose CLUTCH, a deep combinatorial bandit that observes variable-length JavaScript test cases using attention mechanisms and dynamically adapts exploration using Concrete Dropout.

Result: CLUTCH increases valid test cases by 20.3% and coverage-per-testcase by 8.9% on average. It achieves at least 78.1% and 4.1% less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings respectively compared to state-of-the-art bandits.

Conclusion: CLUTCH demonstrates superior performance in JavaScript fuzzing by intelligently selecting mutation targets using combinatorial bandits and deep learning techniques.

Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and
server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to
the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing
approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in
JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation
targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms.
Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe
variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention
mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can
dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in
JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing
the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively,
20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that
CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1%
less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CTRL-Rec enables real-time natural language control of recommender systems by using LLMs to simulate user approval judgments and training embedding models that approximate these judgments, requiring only a single LLM embedding computation per user request at deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users often lack fine-grained controls for changing recommendations when dissatisfied, and LLMs offer a solution by allowing natural language guidance of recommendations.

Method: At training time, use LLM to simulate user approval of items based on language requests and train embedding models to approximate these judgments. Integrate user-request-based predictions into standard recommender system signal weighting. At deployment, require only one LLM embedding computation per user request.

Result: In MovieLens experiments, CTRL-Rec consistently enabled fine-grained control across diverse requests. In user study with 19 Letterboxd users, CTRL-Rec was positively received and significantly enhanced users' sense of control and satisfaction compared to traditional controls.

Conclusion: CTRL-Rec successfully provides computationally efficient, real-time natural language control over recommender systems, improving user satisfaction and control.

Abstract: When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,
they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models
(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations
through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a
different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows
for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time
with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to
simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,
and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We
then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting
of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,
we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing
for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens
dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a
diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that
CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'
sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional
controls.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a generalizable automated theorem prover that can handle diverse scientific domains while maintaining formal correctness, addressing the limitations of specialized systems that struggle with generalization.

Method: Combines Large Language Models (LLMs) for knowledge and reasoning with Lean tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP) to ensure formal correctness, using a multi-agent system approach.

Result: Competitive with state-of-the-art provers on public math benchmarks and largely outperforms them on new benchmarks in abstract algebra and quantum theory; successfully assisted an expert mathematician in formalizing a complex cryptography theorem.

Conclusion: The tool-based agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal verification across diverse scientific domains, overcoming the generalization limitations of specialized systems.

Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.
