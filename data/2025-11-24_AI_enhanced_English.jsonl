However, conventional codecs, which aim to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the compressed and input videos, can cause quality saturation (QS) when applied to UGC, i.e., increasing the bitrate preserves input artifacts without improving visual quality. A direct approach to solve this problem is to detect QS by repeatedly evaluating a non-reference metric (NRM) on videos compressed with multiple codec parameters, which is inefficient. In this paper, we re-frame UGC compression and QS detection from the lens of noisy source coding theory: rather than using a NRM, we compute the MSE with respect to the denoised UGC, which serves as an alternative reference (D-MSE). Unlike MSE measured between the UGC input and the compressed UGC, D-MSE saturates at non-zero values as bitrates increase, a phenomenon we term distortion saturation (DS). Since D-MSE can be computed at the block level in the transform domain, we can efficiently detect D-MSE without coding and decoding with various parameters. We propose two methods for DS detection: distortion saturation detection (DSD), which relies on an input-dependent threshold derived from the D-MSE of the input UGC, and rate-distortion saturation detection (RDSD), which estimates the Lagrangian at the saturation point using a low-complexity compression method. Both methods work as a pre-processing step that can help standard-compliant codecs avoid QS in UGC compression. Experiments with AVC show that preventing encoding in the saturation region, i.e., avoiding encoding at QPs that result in QS according to our methods, achieves BD-rate savings of 8%-20% across multiple different NRMs, compared to a na\u00efve baseline that encodes at the given input QP while ignoring QS.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes efficient methods to detect quality saturation in UGC video compression by using denoised MSE instead of conventional NRM evaluation, achieving 8%-20% BD-rate savings.", "motivation": "Conventional codecs cause quality saturation when compressing noisy UGC videos - increasing bitrate preserves input artifacts without improving visual quality.

Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative by synthesizing compact datasets that preserve the learning behavior of full data. However, extending dataset distillation to time-series forecasting is non-trivial due to two fundamental challenges: 1.temporal bias from strong autocorrelation, which leads to distorted value-term alignment between teacher and student models; and 2.insufficient diversity among synthetic samples, arising from the absence of explicit categorical priors to regularize trajectory variety.\n  In this work, we propose DDTime, a lightweight and plug-in distillation framework built upon first-order condensation decomposition. To tackle Challenge 1, it revisits value-term alignment through temporal statistics and introduces a frequency-domain alignment mechanism to mitigate autocorrelation-induced bias, ensuring spectral consistency and temporal fidelity. To address Challenge 2, we further design an inter-sample regularization inspired by the information bottleneck principle, which enhances diversity and maximizes information density across synthetic trajectories.

Instead of directly storing raw CSI, we learn a compact low-dimensional radio map embedding and leverage a generative model to reconstruct the high-dimensional CSI. Specifically, to address the uncertainty of sparse CSI, a dual-scale feature extraction scheme is designed to enhance feature representation by jointly exploiting correlations from angular space and across neighboring samples.

These noise types often overlap, making them difficult to distinguish and remove using conventional filtering and thresholding methods. As a result, noise removal techniques that preserve image fidelity are important for analyzing and interpreting images of a neutron source. Current solutions include a combination of filtering and thresholding methodologies.

Consequently, paired high-quality data are difficult to prepare via simulation, hindering application of data-driven veiling glare removal models. To this end, we propose VeilGen, a generative model that learns to simulate veiling glare by estimating its underlying optical transmission and glare maps in an unsupervised manner from target images, regularized by Stable Diffusion (SD)-based priors. VeilGen enables paired dataset generation with realistic compound degradation of optical aberrations and veiling glare, while also providing the estimated latent optical transmission and glare maps to guide the veiling glare removal process. We further introduce DeVeiler, a restoration network trained with a reversibility constraint, which utilizes the predicted latent maps to guide an inverse process of the learned scattering model. Extensive experiments on challenging compact optical systems demonstrate that our approach delivers superior restoration quality and physical fidelity compared with existing methods. These suggest that VeilGen reliably synthesizes realistic veiling glare, and its learned latent maps effectively guide the restoration process in DeVeiler.

Consequently, they provide limited insight into coverage-efficiency trade-offs, or a model-agnostic and distribution-free nature favored by CP methods. To this end, we fill this gap by propose an ordinal-CP method that is model-agnostic and provides instance-level optimal prediction intervals. Specifically, we formulate conformal ordinal classification as a minimum-length covering problem at the instance level. To solve this problem, we develop a sliding-window algorithm that is optimal on each calibration data, with only a linear time complexity in K, the number of label candidates. The local optimality per instance further also improves predictive efficiency in expectation. Moreover, we propose a length-regularized variant that shrinks prediction set size while preserving coverage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets from diverse domains are conducted to demonstrate the significantly improved predictive efficiency of the proposed methods over baselines (by 15% decrease on average over four datasets).", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes a model-agnostic conformal prediction method for ordinal classification that provides instance-level optimal prediction intervals with statistical guarantees.", "motivation": "Existing ordinal conformal prediction methods are either heuristic or require restrictive unimodal distribution assumptions, limiting their coverage-efficiency trade-offs and model-agnostic nature.", "method": "Formulates ordinal classification as minimum-length covering problem, develops sliding-window algorithm with linear complexity, and introduces length-regularized variant for smaller prediction sets.", "result": "Significantly improves predictive efficiency over baselines by 15% average decrease across four benchmark datasets from diverse domains.", "conclusion": "The proposed method provides model-agnostic, distribution-free ordinal conformal prediction with instance-level optimality and improved efficiency while maintaining statistical guarantees."}}

We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation.

Although time-series provide rich discriminative information, they also contain substantial redundancy, such as steady-state machine operation records and zero-output periods of solar power generation. Such redundancy diminishes the attention given to discriminative timestamps in representation learning, thus leading to performance bottlenecks in MTS clustering. Masking has been widely adopted to enhance the MTS representation, where temporal reconstruction tasks are designed to capture critical information from MTS. However, most existing masking strategies appear to be standalone preprocessing steps, isolated from the learning process, which hinders dynamic adaptation to the importance of clustering-critical timestamps. Accordingly, this paper proposes the Evolving-masked MTS Clustering (EMTC) method, with its model architecture composed of Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM) and Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV) representation learning modules. IVM adaptively guides the model in learning more discriminative representations for clustering, while the MEV-based reconstruction and contrastive learning pathways enhance the generalization. That is, the MEV reconstruction facilitates multi-perspective complementary to prevent the masking from premature convergence, and the clustering-guided contrastive learning facilitates the joint optimization of representation and clustering.

Therefore, we propose ChainV, a framework that dynamically integrates visual hints into the reasoning process, thereby making multimodal reasoning shorter and better. Specifically, ChainV first performs a coarse visual patch selection based on the previous reasoning step, then refines it by identifying the most representative atomic visual hint according to the averaged attention intensity. Additionally, ChainV introduces a consistency-based evaluation mechanism to assess the reliability of the chosen hint, guiding the model to adaptively adjust its level of self-reflection.

While adversarial knowledge distillation has shown promise in transferring robustness from teacher to student models, traditional single-teacher approaches suffer from limited knowledge diversity, slow convergence, and difficulty in balancing robustness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose MMT-ARD: a Multimodal Multi-Teacher Adversarial Robust Distillation framework. Our key innovation is a dual-teacher knowledge fusion architecture that collaboratively optimizes clean feature preservation and robust feature enhancement. To better handle challenging adversarial examples, we introduce a dynamic weight allocation strategy based on teacher confidence, enabling adaptive focus on harder samples.

We formalize counterfactual world models that additionally take interventions as explicit inputs, predicting temporal sequences under hypothetical modifications to observed scene properties. Traditional world models operate directly on entangled pixel-space representations where object properties and relationships cannot be selectively modified. This modeling choice prevents targeted interventions on specific scene properties.
