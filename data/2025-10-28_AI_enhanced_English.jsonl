A crucial part of\nmulti-sensor fusion is track-to-track association. Previous works often suffer\nfrom high computational complexity or are based on heuristics. We propose an\nassociation algorithms based on stochastic optimization, which leverages a\nmultidimensional likelihood incorporating the number of tracks and their\nspatial distribution and furthermore computes several association hypotheses.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in Monte Carlo simulations and\na realistic collective perception scenario computing high-likelihood\nassociations in ambiguous settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "A stochastic optimization-based track-to-track association algorithm for collective perception in autonomous driving that computes multiple association hypotheses using multidimensional likelihood.", "motivation": "To overcome sensor limitations in autonomous vehicles by combining local environment models from multiple vehicles, where existing methods suffer from high computational complexity or rely on heuristics.", "method": "Proposed association algorithm based on stochastic optimization that uses multidimensional likelihood incorporating track count and spatial distribution, and computes several association hypotheses.", "result": "Demonstrated effectiveness through Monte Carlo simulations and realistic collective perception scenarios, showing capability to compute high-likelihood associations in ambiguous settings.", "conclusion": "The stochastic optimization approach provides an effective solution for track-to-track association in collective perception, handling ambiguous scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency."}}
