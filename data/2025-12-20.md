### [1] [GeoPredict: Leveraging Predictive Kinematics and 3D Gaussian Geometry for Precise VLA Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16811)
*Jingjing Qian,Boyao Han,Chen Shi,Lei Xiao,Long Yang,Shaoshuai Shi,Li Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoPredict enhances Vision-Language-Action models with predictive 3D geometry reasoning for better robotic manipulation, outperforming baselines in geometry-intensive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models are reactive and 2D-centric, making them unreliable for tasks requiring precise 3D reasoning and geometric understanding in robotic manipulation.

Method: Introduces a geometry-aware VLA framework with two predictive modules: 1) trajectory-level module encoding motion history and predicting multi-step 3D keypoint trajectories, and 2) predictive 3D Gaussian geometry module forecasting workspace geometry with track-guided refinement along future trajectories. Uses depth-based rendering for training-time supervision only.

Result: GeoPredict consistently outperforms strong VLA baselines on RoboCasa Human-50, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation tasks, especially in geometry-intensive and spatially demanding scenarios.

Conclusion: Incorporating predictive geometric priors into VLA models significantly improves 3D reasoning capabilities for robotic manipulation while maintaining efficient inference with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models achieve strong generalization in robotic manipulation but remain largely reactive and 2D-centric, making them unreliable in tasks that require precise 3D reasoning. We propose GeoPredict, a geometry-aware VLA framework that augments a continuous-action policy with predictive kinematic and geometric priors. GeoPredict introduces a trajectory-level module that encodes motion history and predicts multi-step 3D keypoint trajectories of robot arms, and a predictive 3D Gaussian geometry module that forecasts workspace geometry with track-guided refinement along future keypoint trajectories. These predictive modules serve exclusively as training-time supervision through depth-based rendering, while inference requires only lightweight additional query tokens without invoking any 3D decoding. Experiments on RoboCasa Human-50, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation tasks show that GeoPredict consistently outperforms strong VLA baselines, especially in geometry-intensive and spatially demanding scenarios.

### [2] [DenseBEV: Transforming BEV Grid Cells into 3D Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16818)
*Marius Dähling,Sebastian Krebs,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenseBEV proposes using BEV feature cells directly as anchors for multi-camera 3D object detection, replacing random queries with a more intuitive two-stage anchor generation method that leverages temporal BEV information and achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional BEV-based transformers use random queries as anchors, which are optimized gradually. Recent approaches add auxiliary network detections. The authors propose a more intuitive approach using BEV feature cells directly as anchors, leveraging the dense grid structure for better object detection.

Method: Two-stage anchor generation using BEV feature cells as object queries; BEV-based Non-Maximum Suppression for gradient flow through non-suppressed objects; hybrid temporal modeling integrating prior detections; end-to-end training without post-processing.

Result: Significant improvements on nuScenes (NDS and mAP) and Waymo Open dataset (LET-mAP 60.7%, +5.4% over previous best); particularly effective for small objects with 3.8% mAP increase for pedestrians on nuScenes and 8% LET-mAP increase on Waymo.

Conclusion: DenseBEV demonstrates that using BEV feature cells as anchors provides a more efficient and effective approach for multi-camera 3D object detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance while being particularly beneficial for detecting small objects.

Abstract: In current research, Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)-based transformers are increasingly utilized for multi-camera 3D object detection. Traditional models often employ random queries as anchors, optimizing them successively. Recent advancements complement or replace these random queries with detections from auxiliary networks. We propose a more intuitive and efficient approach by using BEV feature cells directly as anchors. This end-to-end approach leverages the dense grid of BEV queries, considering each cell as a potential object for the final detection task. As a result, we introduce a novel two-stage anchor generation method specifically designed for multi-camera 3D object detection. To address the scaling issues of attention with a large number of queries, we apply BEV-based Non-Maximum Suppression, allowing gradients to flow only through non-suppressed objects. This ensures efficient training without the need for post-processing. By using BEV features from encoders such as BEVFormer directly as object queries, temporal BEV information is inherently embedded. Building on the temporal BEV information already embedded in our object queries, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling approach by integrating prior detections to further enhance detection performance. Evaluating our method on the nuScenes dataset shows consistent and significant improvements in NDS and mAP over the baseline, even with sparser BEV grids and therefore fewer initial anchors. It is particularly effective for small objects, enhancing pedestrian detection with a 3.8% mAP increase on nuScenes and an 8% increase in LET-mAP on Waymo. Applying our method, named DenseBEV, to the challenging Waymo Open dataset yields state-of-the-art performance, achieving a LET-mAP of 60.7%, surpassing the previous best by 5.4%.

### [4] [Radiology Report Generation with Layer-Wise Anatomical Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16841)
*Emmanuel D. Muñiz-De-León,Jorge A. Rosales-de-Golferichs,Ana S. Muñoz-Rodríguez,Alejandro I. Trejo-Castro,Eduardo de Avila-Armenta,Antonio Martínez-Torteya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Compact image-to-text model generates chest X-ray findings from single frontal image using frozen DINOv3 encoder and GPT-2 decoder with anatomical attention, outperforming resource-intensive SOTA systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA radiology report generation systems (MAIRA-2, MedPaLM-M) require large-scale multimodal training, clinical metadata, and multiple imaging views, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible for most clinical settings. There's a need for more compact, accessible solutions.

Method: Combines frozen DINOv3 Vision Transformer encoder with GPT-2 decoder enhanced by layer-wise anatomical attention. Uses lung and heart segmentation masks with hierarchical Gaussian smoothing to bias attention toward clinically relevant regions without adding trainable parameters. Generates Findings section from single frontal chest X-ray image.

Result: Achieved substantial gains on MIMIC-CXR dataset: CheXpert Macro-F1 for five key pathologies increased by 168% (0.083 → 0.238), Micro-F1 by 146% (0.137 → 0.337). Broader performance across 14 observations improved by 86% (0.170 → 0.316). Structural coherence (RadGraph F1) improved by 9.7%.

Conclusion: Despite small size and purely image-conditioned design, decoder-level anatomical guidance improves spatial grounding and enhances coherence in clinically relevant regions, demonstrating that compact architectures can outperform resource-intensive SOTA systems.

Abstract: Automatic radiology report generation is a promising application of multimodal deep learning, aiming to reduce reporting workload and improve consistency. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems - such as Multimodal AI for Radiology Applications (MAIRA-2) and Medical Pathways Language Model-Multimodal (MedPaLM-M) - depend on large-scale multimodal training, clinical metadata, and multiple imaging views, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible for most settings. We introduce a compact image-to-text architecture that generates the Findings section of chest X-ray reports from a single frontal image. The model combines a frozen Self-Distillation with No Labels v3 (DINOv3) Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) decoder enhanced by layer-wise anatomical attention. This mechanism integrates lung and heart segmentation masks through hierarchical Gaussian smoothing, biasing attention toward clinically relevant regions without adding trainable parameters. Evaluated on the official Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) dataset using Chest Radiograph Expert (CheXpert) and Radiology Graph (RadGraph) metrics, our approach achieved substantial gains: CheXpert Macro-F1 for five key pathologies increased by 168% (0.083 -> 0.238) and Micro-F1 by 146% (0.137 -> 0.337), while broader performance across 14 observations improved by 86% (0.170 -> 0.316). Structural coherence also improved, with RadGraph F1 rising by 9.7%. Despite its small size and purely image-conditioned design, the model demonstrates that decoder-level anatomical guidance improves spatial grounding and enhances coherence in clinically relevant regions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenTouch is the first in-the-wild egocentric full-hand tactile dataset with synchronized video-touch-pose data, enabling multimodal perception research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite hands being our primary interface with the physical world, egocentric perception lacks understanding of when, where, and how forcefully hands make contact. There's a gap between visual perception and physical interaction, with no existing in-the-wild datasets aligning first-person video with full-hand touch.

Method: Created OpenTouch dataset containing 5.1 hours of synchronized video-touch-pose data and 2,900 curated clips with detailed text annotations. Introduced retrieval and classification benchmarks to probe how touch grounds perception and action.

Result: Tactile signals provide compact yet powerful cues for grasp understanding, strengthen cross-modal alignment, and can be reliably retrieved from in-the-wild video queries. The dataset enables multimodal research.

Conclusion: By releasing this annotated vision-touch-pose dataset and benchmark, the work aims to advance multimodal egocentric perception, embodied learning, and contact-rich robotic manipulation.

Abstract: The human hand is our primary interface to the physical world, yet egocentric perception rarely knows when, where, or how forcefully it makes contact. Robust wearable tactile sensors are scarce, and no existing in-the-wild datasets align first-person video with full-hand touch. To bridge the gap between visual perception and physical interaction, we present OpenTouch, the first in-the-wild egocentric full-hand tactile dataset, containing 5.1 hours of synchronized video-touch-pose data and 2,900 curated clips with detailed text annotations. Using OpenTouch, we introduce retrieval and classification benchmarks that probe how touch grounds perception and action. We show that tactile signals provide a compact yet powerful cue for grasp understanding, strengthen cross-modal alignment, and can be reliably retrieved from in-the-wild video queries. By releasing this annotated vision-touch-pose dataset and benchmark, we aim to advance multimodal egocentric perception, embodied learning, and contact-rich robotic manipulation.

### [6] [GenEval 2: Addressing Benchmark Drift in Text-to-Image Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16853)
*Amita Kamath,Kai-Wei Chang,Ranjay Krishna,Luke Zettlemoyer,Yushi Hu,Marjan Ghazvininejad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenEval benchmark has drifted from human judgment over time, showing up to 17.7% error for current models. Authors introduce GenEval 2 with better concept coverage and compositionality, plus Soft-TIFA evaluation method to reduce future drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated T2I evaluation faces benchmark drift problems where static benchmarks fail to keep up with evolving model capabilities, causing misalignment with human judgment over time.

Method: 1) Analyze benchmark drift in GenEval via human study; 2) Create GenEval 2 with improved visual primitive coverage and higher compositionality; 3) Develop Soft-TIFA evaluation method combining judgments for visual primitives.

Result: GenEval has drifted significantly from human judgment (up to 17.7% absolute error), indicating saturation. GenEval 2 is more challenging for current models, and Soft-TIFA shows better alignment with human judgment and reduced drift potential.

Conclusion: Benchmark drift is a serious issue in T2I evaluation. GenEval 2 with Soft-TIFA provides a stronger benchmark, but continual audits and improvements are essential to maintain human alignment over time.

Abstract: Automating Text-to-Image (T2I) model evaluation is challenging; a judge model must be used to score correctness, and test prompts must be selected to be challenging for current T2I models but not the judge. We argue that satisfying these constraints can lead to benchmark drift over time, where the static benchmark judges fail to keep up with newer model capabilities. We show that benchmark drift is a significant problem for GenEval, one of the most popular T2I benchmarks. Although GenEval was well-aligned with human judgment at the time of its release, it has drifted far from human judgment over time -- resulting in an absolute error of as much as 17.7% for current models. This level of drift strongly suggests that GenEval has been saturated for some time, as we verify via a large-scale human study. To help fill this benchmarking gap, we introduce a new benchmark, GenEval 2, with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher degrees of compositionality, which we show is more challenging for current models. We also introduce Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method for GenEval 2 that combines judgments for visual primitives, which we show is more well-aligned with human judgment and argue is less likely to drift from human-alignment over time (as compared to more holistic judges such as VQAScore). Although we hope GenEval 2 will provide a strong benchmark for many years, avoiding benchmark drift is far from guaranteed and our work, more generally, highlights the importance of continual audits and improvement for T2I and related automated model evaluation benchmarks.

### [7] [RePlan: Reasoning-guided Region Planning for Complex Instruction-based Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16864)
*Tianyuan Qu,Lei Ke,Xiaohang Zhan,Longxiang Tang,Yuqi Liu,Bohao Peng,Bei Yu,Dong Yu,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RePlan introduces a plan-then-execute framework for complex image editing, using a vision-language planner to decompose instructions and ground them to regions, then applying parallel multi-region edits via attention injection, outperforming baselines on challenging IV-Complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-based image editing models struggle with Instruction-Visual Complexity (IV-Complexity), where intricate instructions meet cluttered or ambiguous scenes, leading to poor performance in fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits.

Method: RePlan uses a plan-then-execute framework: 1) Vision-language planner decomposes instructions via step-by-step reasoning and explicitly grounds them to target regions, 2) Diffusion editor applies changes using training-free attention-region injection for parallel multi-region edits without iterative inpainting. Enhanced with GRPO-based reinforcement learning on 1K instruction-only examples.

Result: RePlan consistently outperforms strong baselines trained on far larger datasets across IV-Complex settings, improving regional precision and overall fidelity. The method shows substantial gains in reasoning fidelity and format reliability.

Conclusion: RePlan effectively addresses IV-Complexity in image editing through explicit planning and region-aligned execution, demonstrating superior performance on fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits without requiring large training datasets.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing enables natural-language control over visual modifications, yet existing models falter under Instruction-Visual Complexity (IV-Complexity), where intricate instructions meet cluttered or ambiguous scenes. We introduce RePlan (Region-aligned Planning), a plan-then-execute framework that couples a vision-language planner with a diffusion editor. The planner decomposes instructions via step-by-step reasoning and explicitly grounds them to target regions; the editor then applies changes using a training-free attention-region injection mechanism, enabling precise, parallel multi-region edits without iterative inpainting. To strengthen planning, we apply GRPO-based reinforcement learning using 1K instruction-only examples, yielding substantial gains in reasoning fidelity and format reliability. We further present IV-Edit, a benchmark focused on fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits. Across IV-Complex settings, RePlan consistently outperforms strong baselines trained on far larger datasets, improving regional precision and overall fidelity.

### [8] [Pixel Seal: Adversarial-only training for invisible image and video watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16874)
*Tomáš Souček,Pierre Fernandez,Hady Elsahar,Sylvestre-Alvise Rebuffi,Valeriu Lacatusu,Tuan Tran,Tom Sander,Alexandre Mourachko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pixel Seal introduces a new state-of-the-art image and video watermarking method that solves three key issues: unreliable perceptual losses, optimization instability, and resolution scaling problems, achieving better robustness and imperceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current invisible watermarking methods struggle to balance robustness against true imperceptibility, relying on proxy perceptual losses that fail to mimic human perception, suffering from optimization instability with conflicting objectives, and having reduced performance when scaling to high-resolution images and videos.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) adversarial-only training paradigm eliminating unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses; 2) three-stage training schedule decoupling robustness and imperceptibility for stable convergence; 3) high-resolution adaptation using JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts.

Result: Pixel Seal shows clear improvements over state-of-the-art methods in robustness and imperceptibility across different image types and transformations, and efficiently adapts to video via temporal watermark pooling.

Conclusion: Pixel Seal positions itself as a practical and scalable solution for reliable provenance in real-world image and video settings, addressing fundamental limitations of existing watermarking approaches.

Abstract: Invisible watermarking is essential for tracing the provenance of digital content. However, training state-of-the-art models remains notoriously difficult, with current approaches often struggling to balance robustness against true imperceptibility. This work introduces Pixel Seal, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image and video watermarking. We first identify three fundamental issues of existing methods: (i) the reliance on proxy perceptual losses such as MSE and LPIPS that fail to mimic human perception and result in visible watermark artifacts; (ii) the optimization instability caused by conflicting objectives, which necessitates exhaustive hyperparameter tuning; and (iii) reduced robustness and imperceptibility of watermarks when scaling models to high-resolution images and videos. To overcome these issues, we first propose an adversarial-only training paradigm that eliminates unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses. Second, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that stabilizes convergence by decoupling robustness and imperceptibility. Third, we address the resolution gap via high-resolution adaptation, employing JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts. We thoroughly evaluate the robustness and imperceptibility of Pixel Seal on different image types and across a wide range of transformations, and show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art. We finally demonstrate that the model efficiently adapts to video via temporal watermark pooling, positioning Pixel Seal as a practical and scalable solution for reliable provenance in real-world image and video settings.

### [9] [Memory-Enhanced SAM3 for Occlusion-Robust Surgical Instrument Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16880)
*Valay Bundele,Mehran Hosseinzadeh,Hendrik P. A. Lensch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMeDI-SAM3 enhances SAM3 for surgical instrument segmentation with memory filtering, interpolation, and re-identification to handle occlusions and improve accuracy without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical instrument segmentation in endoscopic videos is challenging due to occlusions, rapid motion, specular artifacts, and instrument re-entry. SAM3's limitations include indiscriminate memory updates, fixed capacity, and weak identity recovery after occlusions.

Method: Three training-free components: (1) relevance-aware memory filtering with occlusion-aware memory for pre-occlusion frames, (2) piecewise interpolation to expand effective memory capacity, (3) feature-based re-identification with temporal voting for post-occlusion identity disambiguation.

Result: Absolute mcIoU improvements of ~7% on EndoVis17 and ~16% on EndoVis18 over vanilla SAM3 in zero-shot setting, outperforming prior training-based approaches.

Conclusion: ReMeDI-SAM3 effectively addresses SAM3's limitations for surgical scenes through memory enhancement and identity recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance without training.

Abstract: Accurate surgical instrument segmentation in endoscopic videos is crucial for computer-assisted interventions, yet remains challenging due to frequent occlusions, rapid motion, specular artefacts, and long-term instrument re-entry. While SAM3 provides a powerful spatio-temporal framework for video object segmentation, its performance in surgical scenes is limited by indiscriminate memory updates, fixed memory capacity, and weak identity recovery after occlusions. We propose ReMeDI-SAM3, a training-free memory-enhanced extension of SAM3, that addresses these limitations through three components: (i) relevance-aware memory filtering with a dedicated occlusion-aware memory for storing pre-occlusion frames, (ii) a piecewise interpolation scheme that expands the effective memory capacity, and (iii) a feature-based re-identification module with temporal voting for reliable post-occlusion identity disambiguation. Together, these components mitigate error accumulation and enable reliable recovery after occlusions. Evaluations on EndoVis17 and EndoVis18 under a zero-shot setting show absolute mcIoU improvements of around 7% and 16%, respectively, over vanilla SAM3, outperforming even prior training-based approaches.

### [10] [M-PhyGs: Multi-Material Object Dynamics from Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16885)
*Norika Wada,Kohei Yamashita,Ryo Kawahara,Ko Nishino*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-PhyGs estimates material composition and mechanical parameters of complex multi-material objects (like flowers) from video, using 3D Gaussian representations and novel training losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for estimating physical material parameters from visual data have limitations: they assume homogeneous single-material objects, require pre-learned dynamics, or handle only simplistic topologies. Real-world objects like flowers have complex material compositions and geometries that break these assumptions.

Method: M-PhyGs (Multi-material Physical Gaussians) uses 3D Gaussian representations to jointly segment objects into similar materials and recover continuum mechanical parameters from short videos. It introduces cascaded 3D and 2D losses for efficient training and leverages temporal mini-batching.

Result: The method is evaluated on Phlowers dataset (people interacting with flowers) and demonstrates accurate and effective multi-material physical parameter estimation, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: M-PhyGs successfully addresses the challenging task of estimating physical material parameters for complex multi-material objects from video, providing a practical solution for real-world applications like flower analysis.

Abstract: Knowledge of the physical material properties governing the dynamics of a real-world object becomes necessary to accurately anticipate its response to unseen interactions. Existing methods for estimating such physical material parameters from visual data assume homogeneous single-material objects, pre-learned dynamics, or simplistic topologies. Real-world objects, however, are often complex in material composition and geometry lying outside the realm of these assumptions. In this paper, we particularly focus on flowers as a representative common object. We introduce Multi-material Physical Gaussians (M-PhyGs) to estimate the material composition and parameters of such multi-material complex natural objects from video. From a short video captured in a natural setting, M-PhyGs jointly segments the object into similar materials and recovers their continuum mechanical parameters while accounting for gravity. M-PhyGs achieves this efficiently with newly introduced cascaded 3D and 2D losses, and by leveraging temporal mini-batching. We introduce a dataset, Phlowers, of people interacting with flowers as a novel platform to evaluate the accuracy of this challenging task of multi-material physical parameter estimation. Experimental results on Phlowers dataset demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of M-PhyGs and its components.

### [11] [LinkedOut: Linking World Knowledge Representation Out of Video LLM for Next-Generation Video Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16891)
*Haichao Zhang,Yao Lu,Lichen Wang,Yunzhe Li,Daiwei Chen,Yunpeng Xu,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinkedOut: A VLLM-based video representation method that extracts world knowledge from raw video frames for fast, multi-video recommendation without language bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) face deployment challenges for downstream tasks like recommendation due to high latency from decode-only generation, lack of multi-video input support, and loss of fine-grained visual details when constrained to language outputs.

Method: LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. It introduces a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects appropriate abstraction levels from VLLM features for personalized, interpretable recommendation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks for video recommendation without handcrafted labels. Interpretability studies confirm benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion.

Conclusion: LinkedOut provides a practical path to fully leverage VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks like recommendation, addressing key deployment challenges while preserving pixel-level detail.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) unlock world-knowledge-aware video understanding through pretraining on internet-scale data and have already shown promise on tasks such as movie analysis and video question answering. However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation.

*Kaiwen Jiang,Xueting Li,Seonwook Park,Ravi Ramamoorthi,Shalini De Mello,Koki Nagano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Instant4D: A method that distills 2D diffusion knowledge into a feed-forward encoder to create 3D-consistent, fast, and expressive portrait animation from single images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D video diffusion models lack 3D consistency and are slow, while 3D-aware methods have poor expression details. Need a solution that combines 3D consistency, speed, and expression quality for real-world applications like digital twins.

Method: Distills knowledge from 2D diffusion models into a feed-forward encoder. Uses decoupled animation representation from 3D face representation with implicit motion learning. Employs efficient lightweight local fusion instead of computationally intensive global fusion mechanisms.

Result: Achieves 107.31 FPS for animation and pose control while maintaining comparable animation quality to state-of-the-art methods, balancing speed and quality effectively.

Conclusion: Successfully combines strengths of 2D and 3D methods to create fast, 3D-consistent, and expressive portrait animation from single images, suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Portrait animation has witnessed tremendous quality improvements thanks to recent advances in video diffusion models. However, these 2D methods often compromise 3D consistency and speed, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios, such as digital twins or telepresence. In contrast, 3D-aware facial animation feedforward methods -- built upon explicit 3D representations, such as neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting -- ensure 3D consistency and achieve faster inference speed, but come with inferior expression details. In this paper, we aim to combine their strengths by distilling knowledge from a 2D diffusion-based method into a feed-forward encoder, which instantly converts an in-the-wild single image into a 3D-consistent, fast yet expressive animatable representation. Our animation representation is decoupled from the face's 3D representation and learns motion implicitly from data, eliminating the dependency on pre-defined parametric models that often constrain animation capabilities. Unlike previous computationally intensive global fusion mechanisms (e.g., multiple attention layers) for fusing 3D structural and animation information, our design employs an efficient lightweight local fusion strategy to achieve high animation expressivity. As a result, our method runs at 107.31 FPS for animation and pose control while achieving comparable animation quality to the state-of-the-art, surpassing alternative designs that trade speed for quality or vice versa.

Motivation: Current diffusion-based acceleration methods for long-portrait animation struggle to maintain identity consistency while achieving fast inference speeds.

Method: Uses identity-agnostic facial expression features, Normalized Facial Expression Block for alignment, dynamic sliding-window with weighted blending for smooth transitions, and higher-order latent derivatives to skip denoising steps for acceleration.

Result: Achieves up to 6x acceleration in inference speed while preserving identity consistency in long animations, with effectiveness demonstrated both qualitatively and quantitatively on benchmarks.

Conclusion: FlashPortrait successfully addresses the identity consistency problem in long-portrait animation while achieving significant speed acceleration through innovative architectural and inference techniques.

Abstract: Current diffusion-based acceleration methods for long-portrait animation struggle to ensure identity (ID) consistency. This paper presents FlashPortrait, an end-to-end video diffusion transformer capable of synthesizing ID-preserving, infinite-length videos while achieving up to 6x acceleration in inference speed. In particular, FlashPortrait begins by computing the identity-agnostic facial expression features with an off-the-shelf extractor. It then introduces a Normalized Facial Expression Block to align facial features with diffusion latents by normalizing them with their respective means and variances, thereby improving identity stability in facial modeling. During inference, FlashPortrait adopts a dynamic sliding-window scheme with weighted blending in overlapping areas, ensuring smooth transitions and ID consistency in long animations. In each context window, based on the latent variation rate at particular timesteps and the derivative magnitude ratio among diffusion layers, FlashPortrait utilizes higher-order latent derivatives at the current timestep to directly predict latents at future timesteps, thereby skipping several denoising steps and achieving 6x speed acceleration. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of FlashPortrait both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: Alchemist is a meta-gradient-based framework that automatically selects high-quality subsets from large-scale text-image datasets for T2I model training, improving data efficiency and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models are limited by low-quality training data from web-crawled and synthetic sources, which degrade visual fidelity and training efficiency. Existing data selection methods rely on manual curation or simplistic heuristics, and meta-learning approaches haven't been adapted for image modalities.

Method: Alchemist uses meta-gradient learning to assess sample influence through two stages: 1) Training a lightweight rater that estimates each sample's influence using gradient information enhanced with multi-granularity perception, and 2) Using Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient training.

Result: Experiments show Alchemist consistently improves visual quality and downstream performance. Training on just 50% of data selected by Alchemist can outperform training on the full dataset across both synthetic and web-crawled datasets.

Conclusion: Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for T2I training that effectively addresses data quality issues and improves training efficiency without manual curation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models, such as Imagen, Stable Diffusion, and FLUX, have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of training data. Web-crawled and synthetic image datasets often contain low-quality or redundant samples, which lead to degraded visual fidelity, unstable training, and inefficient computation. Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. To this end, we propose **Alchemist**, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs. Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception. We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training. Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for Text-to-Image model training. Experiments on both synthetic and web-crawled datasets demonstrate that Alchemist consistently improves visual quality and downstream performance. Training on an Alchemist-selected 50% of the data can outperform training on the full dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based video editing methods are limited by training on simple editing operations, which restricts their ability to generalize to complex, real-world instructions. There's a need for better generalization to diverse editing tasks.

Method: 1) VLM-based instructor encodes textual instructions, first video frame, and optional reference image into visually-grounded representations; 2) Edit-GRPO post-training stage adapts Group Relative Policy Optimization for video editing; 3) Synthetic data pipeline generates diverse paired video-instruction data.

Result: VIVA achieves superior instruction following, generalization, and editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: VIVA provides a scalable solution for instruction-based video editing that effectively addresses the generalization gap through VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization, enabling better handling of diverse real-world editing instructions.

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing aims to modify an input video according to a natural-language instruction while preserving content fidelity and temporal coherence. However, existing diffusion-based approaches are often trained on paired data of simple editing operations, which fundamentally limits their ability to generalize to diverse and complex, real-world instructions. To address this generalization gap, we propose VIVA, a scalable framework for instruction-based video editing that leverages VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization. First, we introduce a VLM-based instructor that encodes the textual instruction, the first frame of the source video, and an optional reference image into visually-grounded instruction representations, providing fine-grained spatial and semantic context for the diffusion transformer backbone. Second, we propose a post-training stage, Edit-GRPO, which adapts Group Relative Policy Optimization to the domain of video editing, directly optimizing the model for instruction-faithful, content-preserving, and aesthetically pleasing edits using relative rewards. Furthermore, we propose a data construction pipeline designed to synthetically generate diverse, high-fidelity paired video-instruction data of basic editing operations. Extensive experiments show that VIVA achieves superior instruction following, generalization, and editing quality over state-of-the-art methods. Website: https://viva-paper.github.io

Motivation: Existing 3D hand trajectory prediction methods are limited by datasets that separate motion from semantic supervision and models that weakly connect reasoning with action. There's a need for better integration of semantic understanding and motion prediction.

Method: 1) Create EgoMAN dataset with 219K 6DoF trajectories and 3M structured QA pairs for semantic, spatial, and motion reasoning. 2) Develop EgoMAN model - a reasoning-to-motion framework that connects vision-language reasoning and motion generation via a trajectory-token interface. 3) Use progressive training to align reasoning with motion dynamics.

Result: The approach produces accurate and stage-aware trajectories with generalization across real-world scenes, addressing the limitations of prior works.

Conclusion: EgoMAN successfully bridges the gap between semantic reasoning and motion prediction for 3D hand trajectory forecasting, enabling more context-aware and accurate trajectory predictions through integrated vision-language reasoning.

Abstract: Prior works on 3D hand trajectory prediction are constrained by datasets that decouple motion from semantic supervision and by models that weakly link reasoning and action. To address these, we first present the EgoMAN dataset, a large-scale egocentric dataset for interaction stage-aware 3D hand trajectory prediction with 219K 6DoF trajectories and 3M structured QA pairs for semantic, spatial, and motion reasoning. We then introduce the EgoMAN model, a reasoning-to-motion framework that links vision-language reasoning and motion generation via a trajectory-token interface. Trained progressively to align reasoning with motion dynamics, our approach yields accurate and stage-aware trajectories with generalization across real-world scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting object changes between scene captures is crucial for applications like robotic tidying and construction monitoring, but varying viewpoints can cause false positives.

Method: Training-free approach using pretrained 3D, segmentation, and image encoding models; aligns captures in 3D, extracts object regions, and compares spatial and semantic features.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches by large margins (94% and 37.4% relative AP improvements) on multiview and two-view benchmarks.

Conclusion: SceneDiff provides an effective solution for multiview object change detection with significant performance improvements and introduces the first benchmark with object instance annotations.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying objects that have been added, removed, or moved between a pair of captures (images or videos) of the same scene at different times. Detecting such changes is important for many applications, such as robotic tidying or construction progress and safety monitoring. A major challenge is that varying viewpoints can cause objects to falsely appear changed. We introduce SceneDiff Benchmark, the first multiview change detection benchmark with object instance annotations, comprising 350 diverse video pairs with thousands of changed objects. We also introduce the SceneDiff method, a new training-free approach for multiview object change detection that leverages pretrained 3D, segmentation, and image encoding models to robustly predict across multiple benchmarks. Our method aligns the captures in 3D, extracts object regions, and compares spatial and semantic region features to detect changes. Experiments on multi-view and two-view benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches by large margins (94% and 37.4% relative AP improvements). The benchmark and code will be publicly released.

TL;DR: MomaGraph: A unified scene graph representation for household mobile manipulators that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements, with dataset, benchmark, and a 7B vision-language model achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile manipulators in households need rich scene representations that capture object locations, functions, and actionable parts. Prior work separates spatial/functional relations, treats scenes as static, and overlooks task-relevant information.

Method: Introduces MomaGraph representation, creates MomaGraph-Scenes dataset (large-scale annotated task-driven scene graphs), MomaGraph-Bench evaluation suite, and MomaGraph-R1 (7B vision-language model trained with RL on the dataset). Uses Graph-then-Plan framework.

Result: Achieves 71.6% accuracy on benchmark (+11.4% over best baseline), state-of-the-art among open-source models, generalizes across public benchmarks, and transfers effectively to real-robot experiments.

Conclusion: MomaGraph provides a comprehensive solution for household mobile manipulation with unified scene representation, large-scale dataset, systematic evaluation, and a high-performing model that advances embodied AI capabilities.

Abstract: Mobile manipulators in households must both navigate and manipulate. This requires a compact, semantically rich scene representation that captures where objects are, how they function, and which parts are actionable. Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and functional relations, treats scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlooks information most relevant for accomplishing the current task. To address these limitations, we introduce MomaGraph, a unified scene representation for embodied agents that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements. However, advancing such a representation requires both suitable data and rigorous evaluation, which have been largely missing. We thus contribute MomaGraph-Scenes, the first large-scale dataset of richly annotated, task-driven scene graphs in household environments, along with MomaGraph-Bench, a systematic evaluation suite spanning six reasoning capabilities from high-level planning to fine-grained scene understanding. Built upon this foundation, we further develop MomaGraph-R1, a 7B vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning on MomaGraph-Scenes. MomaGraph-R1 predicts task-oriented scene graphs and serves as a zero-shot task planner under a Graph-then-Plan framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models, reaching 71.6% accuracy on the benchmark (+11.4% over the best baseline), while generalizing across public benchmarks and transferring effectively to real-robot experiments.

TL;DR: SFTok is a novel discrete image tokenizer with multi-step iterative mechanism that achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality at high compression rates through self-forcing guided visual reconstruction and debias-and-fitting training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current discrete tokenizers lag behind continuous ones in multimodal systems despite their natural alignment with autoregressive paradigms, limiting their adoption in high-resolution image generation where efficient tokenization is crucial.

Method: Proposes SFTok with multi-step iterative mechanism, self-forcing guided visual reconstruction, and debias-and-fitting training strategy to resolve training-inference inconsistency in multi-step processes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on ImageNet (rFID = 1.21) with only 64 tokens per image and exceptional class-to-image generation performance (gFID = 2.29).

Conclusion: SFTok demonstrates that discrete tokenizers can achieve superior performance through innovative training strategies, making them competitive alternatives to continuous tokenizers in multimodal systems for high-resolution image generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models highlight the pivotal role of image tokenization in high-resolution image generation. By compressing images into compact latent representations, tokenizers enable generative models to operate in lower-dimensional spaces, thereby improving computational efficiency and reducing complexity. Discrete tokenizers naturally align with the autoregressive paradigm but still lag behind continuous ones, limiting their adoption in multimodal systems. To address this, we propose \textbf{SFTok}, a discrete tokenizer that incorporates a multi-step iterative mechanism for precise reconstruction. By integrating \textbf{self-forcing guided visual reconstruction} and \textbf{debias-and-fitting training strategy}, SFTok resolves the training-inference inconsistency in multi-step process, significantly enhancing image reconstruction quality. At a high compression rate of only 64 tokens per image, SFTok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on ImageNet (rFID = 1.21) and demonstrates exceptional performance in class-to-image generation tasks (gFID = 2.29).

TL;DR: A panoramic metric depth foundation model that generalizes across diverse scene distances using a data-in-the-loop approach with synthetic and real data, achieving strong zero-shot generalization on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a panoramic depth estimation model that works robustly across different scene distances (indoor/outdoor, near/far) and generalizes well to diverse real-world scenarios, addressing the challenge of limited labeled panoramic depth data.

Method: Data-in-the-loop paradigm combining: 1) Large-scale dataset from public datasets, UE5 synthetic data, text-to-image models, and web panoramic images; 2) Three-stage pseudo-label curation pipeline to reduce domain gaps; 3) DINOv3-Large backbone with plug-and-play range mask head, sharpness-centric optimization, and geometry-centric optimization for distance robustness and geometric consistency.

Result: Strong performance on multiple benchmarks (Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D, Deep360) with robust zero-shot generalization, particularly stable metric predictions in diverse real-world scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed panoramic metric depth foundation model effectively generalizes across diverse scene distances through comprehensive data curation and specialized optimization techniques, demonstrating practical applicability for real-world panoramic depth estimation.

Abstract: In this work, we present a panoramic metric depth foundation model that generalizes across diverse scene distances. We explore a data-in-the-loop paradigm from the view of both data construction and framework design. We collect a large-scale dataset by combining public datasets, high-quality synthetic data from our UE5 simulator and text-to-image models, and real panoramic images from the web. To reduce domain gaps between indoor/outdoor and synthetic/real data, we introduce a three-stage pseudo-label curation pipeline to generate reliable ground truth for unlabeled images. For the model, we adopt DINOv3-Large as the backbone for its strong pre-trained generalization, and introduce a plug-and-play range mask head, sharpness-centric optimization, and geometry-centric optimization to improve robustness to varying distances and enforce geometric consistency across views. Experiments on multiple benchmarks (e.g., Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D, and Deep360) demonstrate strong performance and zero-shot generalization, with particularly robust and stable metric predictions in diverse real-world scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality stereo video content is in demand due to growth of VR/3D displays, but current production is costly and automatic conversion suffers from error propagation, depth ambiguity, and format inconsistency in traditional multi-stage pipelines.

Method: Introduces UniStereo dataset covering both stereo formats, and proposes StereoPilot - an efficient feed-forward model with learnable domain switcher and cycle consistency loss that directly synthesizes target views without explicit depth maps or iterative diffusion sampling.

Result: StereoPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and computational efficiency, adapting seamlessly to different stereo formats with improved consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed unified dataset and direct synthesis approach overcome limitations of traditional depth-based pipelines, enabling more effective stereo video conversion for practical applications.

Abstract: The rapid growth of stereoscopic displays, including VR headsets and 3D cinemas, has led to increasing demand for high-quality stereo video content. However, producing 3D videos remains costly and complex, while automatic Monocular-to-Stereo conversion is hindered by the limitations of the multi-stage ``Depth-Warp-Inpaint'' (DWI) pipeline. This paradigm suffers from error propagation, depth ambiguity, and format inconsistency between parallel and converged stereo configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce UniStereo, the first large-scale unified dataset for stereo video conversion, covering both stereo formats to enable fair benchmarking and robust model training. Building upon this dataset, we propose StereoPilot, an efficient feed-forward model that directly synthesizes the target view without relying on explicit depth maps or iterative diffusion sampling. Equipped with a learnable domain switcher and a cycle consistency loss, StereoPilot adapts seamlessly to different stereo formats and achieves improved consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StereoPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: AdaTooler-V is a multimodal LLM that adaptively decides when to use vision tools, avoiding unnecessary tool invocations that degrade performance and increase inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs often exhibit "blind tool-use reasoning" - invoking vision tools even when unnecessary, which increases computational costs and hurts performance. There's a need for models that can intelligently determine when visual tools are actually beneficial.

Method: 1) AT-GRPO reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on Tool Benefit Score of each sample. 2) Two training datasets: AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k for supervised fine-tuning and AdaTooler-V-300k for RL training with verifiable rewards across single-image, multi-image, and video data.

Result: Outperforms existing methods across twelve benchmarks, with AdaTooler-V-7B achieving 89.8% accuracy on V* benchmark, surpassing commercial models GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Demonstrates strong reasoning capability in diverse visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: AdaTooler-V successfully addresses the blind tool-use problem in MLLMs through adaptive tool-use decision making, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing unnecessary computational overhead. The approach enables more efficient and effective multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) benefit from multimodal interleaved chain-of-thought (CoT) with vision tool interactions. However, existing open-source models often exhibit blind tool-use reasoning patterns, invoking vision tools even when they are unnecessary, which significantly increases inference overhead and degrades model performance. To this end, we propose AdaTooler-V, an MLLM that performs adaptive tool-use by determining whether a visual problem truly requires tools. First, we introduce AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on the Tool Benefit Score of each sample, encouraging the model to invoke tools only when they provide genuine improvements. Moreover, we construct two datasets to support training: AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k for SFT cold start and AdaTooler-V-300k for RL with verifiable rewards across single-image, multi-image, and video data. Experiments across twelve benchmarks demonstrate the strong reasoning capability of AdaTooler-V, outperforming existing methods in diverse visual reasoning tasks. Notably, AdaTooler-V-7B achieves an accuracy of 89.8\% on the high-resolution benchmark V*, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of driving-targeted dense geometry perception models that can adapt to different scenarios and camera configurations, as conventional methods rely on precise camera parameters and explicit 3D geometric priors.

Method: Uses DINO backbone for visual feature extraction, then employs alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations. Multiple heads decode global point maps in ego coordinates and ego poses for each frame.

Result: DVGT significantly outperforms existing models on various driving scenarios, trained on a large mixture of datasets (nuScenes, OpenScene, Waymo, KITTI, DDAD). It directly predicts metric-scaled geometry without post-alignment with external sensors.

Conclusion: DVGT provides a flexible, camera-agnostic solution for dense 3D geometry perception in autonomous driving that eliminates dependency on precise camera parameters and external sensor alignment.

Abstract: Perceiving and reconstructing 3D scene geometry from visual inputs is crucial for autonomous driving. However, there still lacks a driving-targeted dense geometry perception model that can adapt to different scenarios and camera configurations. To bridge this gap, we propose a Driving Visual Geometry Transformer (DVGT), which reconstructs a global dense 3D point map from a sequence of unposed multi-view visual inputs. We first extract visual features for each image using a DINO backbone, and employ alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations across images. We then use multiple heads to decode a global point map in the ego coordinate of the first frame and the ego poses for each frame. Unlike conventional methods that rely on precise camera parameters, DVGT is free of explicit 3D geometric priors, enabling flexible processing of arbitrary camera configurations. DVGT directly predicts metric-scaled geometry from image sequences, eliminating the need for post-alignment with external sensors. Trained on a large mixture of driving datasets including nuScenes, OpenScene, Waymo, KITTI, and DDAD, DVGT significantly outperforms existing models on various scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that a simplified design with careful data composition and unified control mechanisms can create an effective instruction-based video editing framework that outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: While image editing has advanced rapidly, video editing remains less explored, facing challenges in consistency, control, and generalization. We study the design space of data, architecture, and control, and introduce \emph{EasyV2V}, a simple and effective framework for instruction-based video editing. On the data side, we compose existing experts with fast inverses to build diverse video pairs, lift image edit pairs into videos via single-frame supervision and pseudo pairs with shared affine motion, mine dense-captioned clips for video pairs, and add transition supervision to teach how edits unfold. On the model side, we observe that pretrained text-to-video models possess editing capability, motivating a simplified design. Simple sequence concatenation for conditioning with light LoRA fine-tuning suffices to train a strong model. For control, we unify spatiotemporal control via a single mask mechanism and support optional reference images. Overall, EasyV2V works with flexible inputs, e.g., video+text, video+mask+text, video+mask+reference+text, and achieves state-of-the-art video editing results, surpassing concurrent and commercial systems.

TL;DR: AuditDM is an automated framework that discovers and fixes MLLM failure modes by training an auditor model to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLM evaluation methods lack interpretability and fail to fully reveal significant capability gaps between models. There's a need for more systematic ways to discover and understand model weaknesses.

Method: Fine-tune an MLLM as an auditor using reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. The auditor then uncovers diverse, interpretable failure exemplars that serve as annotation-free data for model rectification.

Result: Applied to state-of-the-art models (Gemma-3, PaliGemma-2), AuditDM discovered over 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improved all models across 16 benchmarks, enabling a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart.

Conclusion: As data scaling reaches diminishing returns, targeted model auditing provides an effective path for model diagnosis and improvement. AuditDM offers a systematic way to discover interpretable failure modes and use them for model enhancement.

Abstract: Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart. Our results suggest that as data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement.

TL;DR: NEPA is a visual self-supervised learning method that trains models to predict future patch embeddings using causal masking, achieving strong performance on ImageNet and segmentation without complex designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by generative pretraining in NLP, the paper explores whether similar principles can create effective visual self-supervised learners by shifting from learning representations to learning models that directly perform predictive tasks.

Method: Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA) trains Transformers to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones using causal masking and stop gradient, without pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads.

Result: NEPA achieves 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transfers effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K.

Conclusion: Generative pretraining from embeddings provides a simple, scalable, and potentially modality-agnostic alternative to visual self-supervised learning, retaining architectural simplicity without requiring additional design complexity.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of generative pretraining in natural language, we ask whether the same principles can yield strong self-supervised visual learners. Instead of training models to output features for downstream use, we train them to generate embeddings to perform predictive tasks directly. This work explores such a shift from learning representations to learning models. Specifically, models learn to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones, using causal masking and stop gradient, which we refer to as Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA). We demonstrate that a simple Transformer pretrained on ImageNet-1k with next embedding prediction as its sole learning objective is effective - no pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads. This formulation retains architectural simplicity and scalability, without requiring additional design complexity. NEPA achieves strong results across tasks, attaining 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transferring effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K. We believe generative pretraining from embeddings provides a simple, scalable, and potentially modality-agnostic alternative to visual self-supervised learning.

*Chun-Wei Tuan Mu,Jia-Bin Huang,Yu-Lun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-step generative method for single-image refocusing: DeblurNet recovers all-in-focus images, BokehNet creates controllable bokeh, trained semi-supervised with real EXIF data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth-of-field control is essential but difficult; current methods require all-in-focus inputs, rely on synthetic data, and have limited aperture control.

Method: Two-step process: 1) DeblurNet recovers all-in-focus images from various inputs, 2) BokehNet creates controllable bokeh. Uses semi-supervised training combining synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images and EXIF metadata.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Enables text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes.

Conclusion: Generative Refocusing overcomes limitations of current methods by using semi-supervised training with real optical characteristics, enabling flexible single-image refocusing with advanced controls.

Abstract: Depth-of-field control is essential in photography, but getting the perfect focus often takes several tries or special equipment. Single-image refocusing is still difficult. It involves recovering sharp content and creating realistic bokeh. Current methods have significant drawbacks. They need all-in-focus inputs, depend on synthetic data from simulators, and have limited control over aperture. We introduce Generative Refocusing, a two-step process that uses DeblurNet to recover all-in-focus images from various inputs and BokehNet for creating controllable bokeh. Our main innovation is semi-supervised training. This method combines synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images, using EXIF metadata to capture real optical characteristics beyond what simulators can provide. Our experiments show we achieve top performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Additionally, our Generative Refocusing allows text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes.

*Hanlin Wang,Hao Ouyang,Qiuyu Wang,Yue Yu,Yihao Meng,Wen Wang,Ka Leong Cheng,Shuailei Ma,Qingyan Bai,Yixuan Li,Cheng Chen,Yanhong Zeng,Xing Zhu,Yujun Shen,Qifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldCanvas is a multimodal framework for generating controllable world events by combining text prompts, motion trajectories, and reference images to create coherent videos with multi-agent interactions and object consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches have limitations: text-only methods lack visual control, and trajectory-controlled image-to-video methods don't support rich semantic intent. There's a need for a framework that enables expressive, user-directed simulation of complex world events with better controllability and coherence.

Method: Multimodal approach combining three components: 1) Trajectories encoding motion, timing, and visibility; 2) Natural language for semantic intent; 3) Reference images for visual grounding of object identity. This enables generation of coherent events with multi-agent interactions, object entry/exit, appearance guidance, and counterintuitive events.

Result: The framework generates videos with temporal coherence and emergent consistency, preserving object identity and scene despite temporary disappearance. It supports expressive world events generation including multi-agent interactions and complex scenarios.

Conclusion: WorldCanvas advances world models from passive predictors to interactive, user-shaped simulators by enabling rich, controllable simulation of world events through multimodal promptable generation.

Abstract: We present WorldCanvas, a framework for promptable world events that enables rich, user-directed simulation by combining text, trajectories, and reference images. Unlike text-only approaches and existing trajectory-controlled image-to-video methods, our multimodal approach combines trajectories -- encoding motion, timing, and visibility -- with natural language for semantic intent and reference images for visual grounding of object identity, enabling the generation of coherent, controllable events that include multi-agent interactions, object entry/exit, reference-guided appearance and counterintuitive events. The resulting videos demonstrate not only temporal coherence but also emergent consistency, preserving object identity and scene despite temporary disappearance. By supporting expressive world events generation, WorldCanvas advances world models from passive predictors to interactive, user-shaped simulators.

### [29] [TOGGLE: Temporal Logic-Guided Large Language Model Compression for Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16855)
*Khurram Khalil,Khaza Anuarul Hoque*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TOGGLE is a novel LLM compression framework that uses Signal Temporal Logic to formally specify and enforce linguistic properties during compression, achieving up to 3.3x FLOPs reduction and 68.8% model size reduction while preserving language quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require substantial computational resources that limit deployment on edge devices, and existing compression techniques degrade linguistic properties without formal guarantees for preserving model behavior.

Method: TOGGLE uses Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to formally specify linguistic properties, then employs STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization to systematically explore layer-wise quantization and pruning configurations, generating compressed models that satisfy linguistic constraints without retraining.

Result: Evaluated on four LLM architectures (GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, Mistral 7B), TOGGLE achieved up to 3.3x reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and up to 68.8% reduction in model size while satisfying all specified linguistic properties.

Conclusion: TOGGLE represents the first integration of formal methods into LLM compression, enabling efficient, verifiable deployment of LLMs on edge hardware with guaranteed preservation of linguistic properties.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver exceptional performance across natural language tasks but demand substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, often degrade critical linguistic properties and lack formal guarantees for preserving model behavior. We propose Temporal Logic-Guided Large Language Model Compression (TOGGLE), a novel framework that leverages Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to formally specify and enforce linguistic properties during compression. TOGGLE employs an STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization to systematically explore layer-wise quantization and pruning configurations, generating compressed models that formally satisfy specified linguistic constraints without retraining or fine-tuning. Evaluating TOGGLE on four LLM architectures (GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Mistral 7B), we achieve up to 3.3x reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and up to a 68.8% reduction in model size while satisfying all linguistic properties. TOGGLE represents the first integration of formal methods into LLM compression, enabling efficient, verifiable deployment of LLMs on edge hardware.

### [30] [Distributional AGI Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16856)
*Nenad Tomašev,Matija Franklin,Julian Jacobs,Sébastien Krier,Simon Osindero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that AI safety research should shift focus from individual AI systems to coordinated groups of sub-AGI agents, proposing a framework of virtual agentic sandbox economies with market mechanisms for collective risk mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety research assumes a monolithic AGI emergence, but the alternative "patchwork AGI" hypothesis - where general capabilities emerge through coordination of sub-AGI agents - has been neglected. With rapid deployment of advanced AI agents capable of tool-use and coordination, this poses urgent safety concerns that need attention.

Method: Proposes a distributional AGI safety framework centered on virtual agentic sandbox economies (impermeable or semi-permeable) where agent-to-agent transactions are governed by robust market mechanisms, combined with auditability, reputation management, and oversight systems.

Result: The paper presents a conceptual framework for addressing collective risks in coordinated AI systems, moving beyond individual agent alignment to consider emergent behaviors in agent groups.

Conclusion: The patchwork AGI hypothesis deserves serious consideration and should inform safety research. A distributional approach focusing on coordinated agent systems with appropriate governance mechanisms is necessary to mitigate collective risks in advanced AI deployments.

Abstract: AI safety and alignment research has predominantly been focused on methods for safeguarding individual AI systems, resting on the assumption of an eventual emergence of a monolithic Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The alternative AGI emergence hypothesis, where general capability levels are first manifested through coordination in groups of sub-AGI individual agents with complementary skills and affordances, has received far less attention. Here we argue that this patchwork AGI hypothesis needs to be given serious consideration, and should inform the development of corresponding safeguards and mitigations. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use capabilities and the ability to communicate and coordinate makes this an urgent safety consideration. We therefore propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that moves beyond evaluating and aligning individual agents. This framework centers on the design and implementation of virtual agentic sandbox economies (impermeable or semi-permeable), where agent-to-agent transactions are governed by robust market mechanisms, coupled with appropriate auditability, reputation management, and oversight to mitigate collective risks.

### [31] [The Social Responsibility Stack: A Control-Theoretic Architecture for Governing Socio-Technical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16873)
*Otman A. Basir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer architectural framework that embeds societal values into AI systems as explicit constraints, safeguards, and governance mechanisms throughout the system lifecycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current responsible AI and governance efforts provide normative principles but lack enforceable engineering mechanisms that operate throughout the AI system lifecycle. There's a need for practical frameworks that can translate ethical principles into actionable controls.

Method: The Social Responsibility Stack (SRS) is proposed as a six-layer architectural framework that models responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem. It integrates design-time safeguards with runtime monitoring and institutional oversight, using a unified constraint-based formulation with safety-envelope and feedback interpretations.

Result: The framework enables continuous monitoring and enforcement of fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality. Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems demonstrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering and operational controls.

Conclusion: SRS bridges ethics, control theory, and AI governance, providing a practical foundation for accountable, adaptive, and auditable socio-technical AI systems that can embed societal values throughout their lifecycle.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in domains that shape human behaviour, institutional decision-making, and societal outcomes. Existing responsible AI and governance efforts provide important normative principles but often lack enforceable engineering mechanisms that operate throughout the system lifecycle. This paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer architectural framework that embeds societal values into AI systems as explicit constraints, safeguards, behavioural interfaces, auditing mechanisms, and governance processes. SRS models responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem over socio-technical systems, integrating design-time safeguards with runtime monitoring and institutional oversight. We develop a unified constraint-based formulation, introduce safety-envelope and feedback interpretations, and show how fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality can be continuously monitored and enforced. Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems illustrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering and operational controls. The framework bridges ethics, control theory, and AI governance, providing a practical foundation for accountable, adaptive, and auditable socio-technical AI systems.

### [32] [Generative Adversarial Reasoner: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16917)
*Qihao Liu,Luoxin Ye,Wufei Ma,Yu-Cheng Chou,Alan Yuille*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative Adversarial Reasoner (GAR) is an adversarial reinforcement learning framework that co-trains an LLM reasoner with an LLM discriminator to improve mathematical reasoning by providing dense step-level rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs with reasoning capabilities still make process errors like incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and superficially plausible but invalid steps. Current methods lack effective step-level feedback for improving reasoning quality.

Method: GAR uses on-policy joint training where an LLM reasoner and LLM discriminator co-evolve through adversarial RL. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions reasoning chains into slices, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with structured justifications. The reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps leading to correct answers, while the discriminator is rewarded for correctly detecting errors.

Result: The method delivers consistent gains across mathematical benchmarks. On AIME24, it improved DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0). It produces dense, well-calibrated step-level rewards that improve credit assignment and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: GAR enhances LLM reasoning quality through adversarial co-training, providing effective step-level feedback. The modular discriminator enables flexible reward shaping for various objectives including teacher distillation, preference alignment, and mathematical proof-based reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities excel at mathematical reasoning yet still commit process errors, such as incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and superficially plausible but invalid steps. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0). The modular discriminator also enables flexible reward shaping for objectives such as teacher distillation, preference alignment, and mathematical proof-based reasoning.

TL;DR: Federated Learning enables collaborative ML model training across decentralized medical datasets for rare disease diagnosis while preserving patient privacy, achieving superior performance over single-institution models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning for rare disease diagnosis is limited by data scarcity and fragmentation across institutions. Privacy regulations and logistical barriers prevent data sharing, creating a need for privacy-preserving collaborative approaches.

Method: Used Federated Learning with Sherpa.ai FL platform to train ML models across distributed datasets from two international organizations. Applied FL to collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures to classify COL6-RD pathogenic mechanisms.

Result: Achieved F1-score of 0.82 for classifying three COL6-RD pathogenic mechanism groups (exon skipping, glycine substitution, pseudoexon insertion), outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). FL improved diagnostic utility and generalizability.

Conclusion: Federated Learning substantially improves rare disease diagnosis by enabling collaborative training while preserving privacy. This approach can support variant interpretation and guide sequencing strategies for novel pathogenic variant discovery.

Abstract: The application of Machine Learning (ML) to the diagnosis of rare diseases, such as collagen VI-related dystrophies (COL6-RD), is fundamentally limited by the scarcity and fragmentation of available data. Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models. Beyond enabling more accurate diagnosis, we anticipate that this approach will support the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and guide the prioritization of sequencing strategies to identify novel pathogenic variants.
