*Zhijie Qiao,Zhong Cao,Henry X. Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nuCarla is a large-scale BEV perception dataset built in CARLA simulator that addresses the lack of standardized datasets for closed-loop autonomous driving simulation, enabling seamless transfer of real-world perception models and accelerating E2E development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets are collected from real world under non-interactive conditions, offering limited value for closed-loop testing and making closed-loop E2E models perform worse than simple rule-based baselines due to lack of standardized, large-scale datasets for learning meaningful intermediate representations like BEV features.

Method: Created nuCarla - a large-scale, nuScenes-style BEV perception dataset within CARLA simulator with full nuScenes format compatibility, balanced class distributions, direct usability for closed-loop simulation, and high-performance BEV backbones.

Result: nuCarla provides a dataset scale comparable to nuScenes with more balanced class distributions, achieves state-of-the-art detection results with high-performance BEV backbones, and enables seamless transfer of real-world perception models.

Conclusion: nuCarla substantially accelerates closed-loop E2E development by providing both data and models as open benchmarks, paving the way toward reliable and safety-aware research in autonomous driving.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving heavily relies on closed-loop simulation, where perception, planning, and control are jointly trained and evaluated in interactive environments. Yet, most existing datasets are collected from the real world under non-interactive conditions, primarily supporting open-loop learning while offering limited value for closed-loop testing. Due to the lack of standardized, large-scale, and thoroughly verified datasets to facilitate learning of meaningful intermediate representations, such as bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, closed-loop E2E models remain far behind even simple rule-based baselines. To address this challenge, we introduce nuCarla, a large-scale, nuScenes-style BEV perception dataset built within the CARLA simulator. nuCarla features (1) full compatibility with the nuScenes format, enabling seamless transfer of real-world perception models; (2) a dataset scale comparable to nuScenes, but with more balanced class distributions; (3) direct usability for closed-loop simulation deployment; and (4) high-performance BEV backbones that achieve state-of-the-art detection results. By providing both data and models as open benchmarks, nuCarla substantially accelerates closed-loop E2E development, paving the way toward reliable and safety-aware research in autonomous driving.

### [2] [Known Meets Unknown: Mitigating Overconfidence in Open Set Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13775)
*Dongdong Zhao,Ranxin Fang,Changtian Song,Zhihui Liu,Jianwen Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework to mitigate overconfidence in Open Set Recognition by using perturbation-based uncertainty estimation and two-stage unknown detection to better distinguish between known and unknown classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overconfidence in OSR occurs when unknown samples similar to known classes get high confidence scores, leading to misclassification. This blurs the decision boundary between known and unknown classes.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) perturbation-based uncertainty estimation using controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions, 2) two-stage unknown detection with learning-based classifiers that leverage estimated uncertainty.

Result: Superior performance over existing OSR methods on three public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses overconfidence in OSR by explicitly handling inter-class overlap through uncertainty estimation and improved unknown detection.

Abstract: Open Set Recognition (OSR) requires models not only to accurately classify known classes but also to effectively reject unknown samples. However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing OSR methods.

### [3] [Temporal Object-Aware Vision Transformer for Few-Shot Video Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13784)
*Yogesh Kumar,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel object-aware temporal modeling approach for few-shot video object detection that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames to maintain temporal consistency and improve detection accuracy with limited labeled examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video object detection methods require extensive training data and struggle with temporal consistency issues like occlusion and appearance variations. Few-shot learning approaches need to overcome these challenges while avoiding computationally expensive region proposals that require task-specific training.

Method: Proposes an object-aware temporal modeling approach with a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. Uses few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, eliminating the need for explicit object tube proposals.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains across multiple datasets: 3.7% AP improvement on FSVOD-500, 5.3% on FSYTV-40, 4.3% on VidOR, and 4.5% on VidVRD in 5-shot setting. Also shows improvements in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses temporal consistency challenges in few-shot video object detection through selective feature propagation, achieving robust performance without relying on complex region proposals, making it computationally efficient and practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Few-shot Video Object Detection (FSVOD) addresses the challenge of detecting novel objects in videos with limited labeled examples, overcoming the constraints of traditional detection methods that require extensive training data. This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting. Further results demonstrate improvements in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations. We make the code public at: https://github.com/yogesh-iitj/fs-video-vit

### [4] [FusionFM: All-in-One Multi-Modal Image Fusion with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13794)
*Huayi Zhu,Xiu Shu,Youqiang Xiong,Qiao Liu,Rui Chen,Di Yuan,Xiaojun Chang,Zhenyu He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FusionFM, a flow matching-based image fusion method that directly transports source modalities to fused images, improving sampling efficiency and structural consistency while addressing lack of supervision through pseudo-label selection and refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal image fusion methods rely on task-specific models with high training costs and limited scalability, while generative methods suffer from slow inference due to complex sampling trajectories.

Method: Formulates fusion as probabilistic transport using flow matching, collects fusion results from SOTA models as priors with task-aware pseudo-label selection, introduces Fusion Refiner module for enhancement, and integrates elastic weight consolidation and experience replay for multi-task learning.

Result: Achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining lightweight model design.

Conclusion: FusionFM provides an efficient and scalable solution for multi-modal image fusion that addresses both sampling efficiency and supervision challenges through flow matching and pseudo-label refinement strategies.

Abstract: Current multi-modal image fusion methods typically rely on task-specific models, leading to high training costs and limited scalability. While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design. The code will be available at: https://github.com/Ist-Zhy/FusionFM.

### [5] [A Trajectory-free Crash Detection Framework with Generative Approach and Segment Map Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13795)
*Weiying Shen,Hao Yu,Yu Dong,Pan Liu,Yu Han,Xin Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework using diffusion models to generate future road segment maps and identify crashes by comparing monitored maps with generated ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time crash detection is essential for proactive safety management and traffic efficiency, but traditional methods face limitations in trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Mapfusion diffusion model generates future road segment maps through noisy-to-normal process guided by temporal embeddings and ControlNet for context, 2) Crash detection by comparing monitored segment maps with generated maps.

Result: Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns, remains robust across different sampling intervals, and effectively detects crashes in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage trajectory-free method is effective for accurate crash detection without requiring vehicle trajectory data.

Abstract: Real-time crash detection is essential for developing proactive safety management strategy and enhancing overall traffic efficiency. To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.

### [6] [Synergizing Multigrid Algorithms with Vision Transformer: A Novel Approach to Enhance the Seismic Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13800)
*Huiwen Wu,Shuo Zhang,Yi Liu,Hongbin Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel adaptive two-grid foundation model (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding is proposed for seismic data, addressing the limitations of standard vision transformers in handling both high- and low-frequency seismic information through spectrum decomposition and progressive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard vision transformers fail to effectively capture both high- and low-frequency features in seismic data due to their sequential tokenization approach, which ignores the intrinsic hierarchical patterns in seismic data.

Method: Uses spectrum decomposition to separate frequency components, hierarchical Hilbert encoding for data representation, and an adaptive training strategy that progressively shifts focus from coarse to fine features based on the frequency principle.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ADATG training methods for seismic foundation models.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the importance of data encoding and training strategies tailored to the unique high- and low-frequency characteristics of seismic data for enhancing visual seismic foundation model pretraining.

Abstract: Due to the emergency and homogenization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology development, transformer-based foundation models have revolutionized scientific applications, such as drug discovery, materials research, and astronomy. However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.

### [7] [Passive Dementia Screening via Facial Temporal Micro-Dynamics Analysis of In-the-Wild Talking-Head Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13802)
*Filippo Cenacchi. Longbing Cao,Mitchell McEwan,Deborah Richards*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Language-free dementia screening using facial micro-dynamics from short videos, achieving high performance without speech or text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable passive, scalable dementia screening from unscripted videos without language dependency or clinical intervention during recording.

Method: Analyze temporal facial kinematics (blink dynamics, mouth/jaw motions, gaze variability, head adjustments) by converting micro movements into interpretable time series and summarizing into clip-level statistics based on motion distribution across streams.

Result: Achieved AUROC 0.953, AP 0.961, F1-score 0.851, accuracy 0.857 on YT DemTalk dataset; identified gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as most informative cues.

Conclusion: Facial micro-dynamics alone are sufficient for effective dementia screening, enabling language-free, scalable detection using lightweight classifiers.

Abstract: We target passive dementia screening from short camera-facing talking head video, developing a facial temporal micro dynamics analysis for language free detection of early neuro cognitive change. This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.

### [8] [Can World Simulators Reason? Gen-ViRe: A Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13853)
*Xinxin Liu,Zhaopan Xu,Kai Wang,Yong Jae Lee,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-ViRe is a new benchmark that quantitatively evaluates video generation models' Chain-of-Frames reasoning capabilities across six cognitive dimensions, revealing gaps between visual quality and actual reasoning depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on visual fidelity but fail to assess core cognitive abilities like multi-step planning and abstract reasoning in Chain-of-Frames reasoning, creating an evaluation void that prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities.

Method: Developed Gen-ViRe framework grounded in cognitive science, decomposing CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions and 24 subtasks. Used multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria.

Result: Experiments on state-of-the-art systems revealed substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools for advancing genuine world simulators.

Conclusion: Gen-ViRe provides the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners, enabling systematic evaluation and principled guidance for improving Chain-of-Frames reasoning capabilities in world simulation.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables sophisticated symbolic reasoning in LLMs, it remains confined to discrete text and cannot simulate the continuous, physics-governed dynamics of the real world. Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.

### [9] [RSPose: Ranking Based Losses for Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13857)
*Muhammed Can Keles,Bedrettin Cetinkaya,Sinan Kalkan,Emre Akbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ranking-based losses for heatmap-based human pose estimation to address issues with MSE loss, heatmap imbalance, and metric-loss discrepancy, achieving state-of-the-art performance on COCO and improving coordinate classification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address three main problems in heatmap-based pose estimation: (1) MSE loss doesn't focus on peak localization, (2) heatmap spatial and class imbalance, (3) discrepancy between evaluation metric (mAP) and loss functions.

Method: Develop ranking-based losses that align with mAP evaluation metric, applied to both 1D and 2D heatmaps across multiple datasets (COCO, CrowdPose, MPII).

Result: RSPose achieves 79.9 mAP on COCO-val with ViTPose-H (new SOTA), improves SimCC Resnet-50 by 1.5 AP to 73.6 AP, and increases correlation between confidence scores and localization quality.

Conclusion: Ranking-based losses effectively address key limitations of traditional heatmap losses, provide better alignment with evaluation metrics, and significantly improve pose estimation performance across different architectures and datasets.

Abstract: While heatmap-based human pose estimation methods have shown strong performance, they suffer from three main problems: (P1) "Commonly used Mean Squared Error (MSE)" Loss may not always improve joint localization because it penalizes all pixel deviations equally, without focusing explicitly on sharpening and correctly localizing the peak corresponding to the joint; (P2) heatmaps are spatially and class-wise imbalanced; and, (P3) there is a discrepancy between the evaluation metric (i.e., mAP) and the loss functions.
  We propose ranking-based losses to address these issues.
  Both theoretically and empirically, we show that our proposed losses are superior to commonly used heatmap losses (MSE, KL-Divergence). Our losses considerably increase the correlation between confidence scores and localization qualities, which is desirable because higher correlation leads to more accurate instance selection during Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and better Average Precision (mAP) performance. We refer to the models trained with our losses as RSPose.
  We show the effectiveness of RSPose across two different modes: one-dimensional and two-dimensional heatmaps, on three different datasets (COCO, CrowdPose, MPII).
  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose losses that align with the evaluation metric (mAP) for human pose estimation.
  RSPose outperforms the previous state of the art on the COCO-val set and achieves an mAP score of 79.9 with ViTPose-H, a vision transformer model for human pose estimation.
  We also improve SimCC Resnet-50, a coordinate classification-based pose estimation method, by 1.5 AP on the COCO-val set, achieving 73.6 AP.

### [10] [Segmenting Collision Sound Sources in Egocentric Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13863)
*Kranti Kumar Parida,Omar Emara,Hazel Doughty,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3) - segmenting objects responsible for collision sounds in video using audio conditioning. Uses foundation models and egocentric cues to address challenges in cluttered scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can recognize object properties from interaction sounds. Inspired by this capability to link audio and visual information for collision events.

Method: Weakly-supervised method using foundation models (CLIP and SAM2) with audio-conditioned segmentation. Incorporates egocentric cues like objects in hands to identify potential collision sound sources.

Result: Outperforms competitive baselines by 3× and 4.7× in mIoU on two new benchmarks: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

Conclusion: Successfully addresses the CS3 task by leveraging multisensory perception principles and foundation models, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline methods.

Abstract: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can often recognise object properties from the sound of their interactions. Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.
  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines by $3\times$ and $4.7\times$ in mIoU on two benchmarks we introduce for the CS3 task: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

### [11] [GRLoc: Geometric Representation Regression for Visual Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13864)
*Changyang Li,Xuejian Ma,Lixiang Liu,Zhan Li,Qingan Yan,Yi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Geometric Representation Regression (GRR) as an alternative to Absolute Pose Regression, explicitly predicting disentangled geometric representations (ray directions and pointmaps) to estimate camera pose through a differentiable solver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current APR models operate as black boxes that memorize training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry, limiting generalization.

Method: Reformulates APR as inverse novel view synthesis, predicting two disentangled geometric representations: ray bundle directions for rotation and pointmaps for translation, then using a differentiable solver to compute final pose.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets, demonstrating improved generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: Modeling the inverse rendering process with explicit geometric disentanglement provides a more robust path toward generalizable absolute pose estimation compared to black-box APR approaches.

Abstract: Absolute Pose Regression (APR) has emerged as a compelling paradigm for visual localization. However, APR models typically operate as black boxes, directly regressing a 6-DoF pose from a query image, which can lead to memorizing training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. In this work, we propose a geometrically-grounded alternative. Inspired by novel view synthesis, which renders images from intermediate geometric representations, we reformulate APR as its inverse that regresses the underlying 3D representations directly from the image, and we name this paradigm Geometric Representation Regression (GRR). Our model explicitly predicts two disentangled geometric representations in the world coordinate system: (1) a ray bundle's directions to estimate camera rotation, and (2) a corresponding pointmap to estimate camera translation. The final 6-DoF camera pose is then recovered from these geometric components using a differentiable deterministic solver. This disentangled approach, which separates the learned visual-to-geometry mapping from the final pose calculation, introduces a strong geometric prior into the network. We find that the explicit decoupling of rotation and translation predictions measurably boosts performance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets, validating that modeling the inverse rendering process is a more robust path toward generalizable absolute pose estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes H-CNN-ViT, a hierarchical multi-branch model for bladder cancer recurrence prediction using multi-sequence MRI, achieving 78.6% AUC on a new curated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bladder cancer has high recurrence rates (up to 78%) and MRI interpretation is challenging due to post-surgical changes. Lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets hinders AI development for recurrence prediction.

Method: H-CNN-ViT model with hierarchical gated attention that selectively weights features from global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths. Multi-branch architecture processes each MRI modality independently for optimal feature integration.

Result: Achieved 78.6% AUC on the curated dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art models for bladder cancer recurrence prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed H-CNN-ViT model effectively addresses bladder cancer recurrence prediction challenges and establishes a valuable benchmark with the new multi-sequence MRI dataset.

Abstract: Bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with a recurrence rate of up to 78%, necessitating accurate post-operative monitoring for effective patient management. Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion. Our multi-branch architecture processes each modality independently, ensuring that the unique properties of each imaging channel are optimally captured and integrated. Evaluated on our dataset, H-CNN-ViT achieves an AUC of 78.6%, surpassing state-of-the-art models. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/XLIAaron/H-CNN-ViT}.

### [13] [QwenCLIP: Boosting Medical Vision-Language Pretraining via LLM Embeddings and Prompt tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13876)
*Xiaoyang Wei,Camille Kurtz,Florence Cloppet*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QwenCLIP replaces CLIP's limited text encoder with an LLM-based embedding module to handle long radiology reports, improving medical image-text alignment through extended context windows and learnable prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's 77-token limit and domain-specific encoders' 512-token constraint hinder representation of long, information-rich radiology reports, limiting medical vision-language performance.

Method: Replace CLIP's text encoder with LLM-based embedding module (Qwen3-Embedding), introduce learnable prompts for cross-modal alignment, leverage extended context windows for comprehensive medical semantics.

Result: QwenCLIP substantially improves medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks by capturing comprehensive semantics from long-form clinical text.

Conclusion: LLM-based text encoders with extended context windows effectively address length limitations in medical vision-language tasks, enabling better representation of long radiology reports.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong generalization for vision-language tasks in computer vision and medical domains, yet its text encoder accepts only up to 77 tokens, which limits its ability to represent long and information-rich radiology reports. Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Wxy-24/QwenCLIP.

*Pandiyaraju V,Abishek Karthik,Jaspin K,Kannan A,Jaime Lloret*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid EfficientNet-VGG19 model with Pseudo-Newton Boosting and Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction layers achieves superior lumbar spine degeneration classification from DICOM images, outperforming baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional transfer learning in medical image analysis, particularly for high-dimensional DICOM images, by developing a more effective architecture for lumbar spine degeneration classification.

Method: Hybrid approach combining EfficientNet and VGG19 with custom Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer for feature weight optimization and Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction layer for redundancy removal, forming a multi-tiered framework.

Result: Achieved precision: 0.9, recall: 0.861, F1 score: 0.88, loss: 0.18, accuracy: 88.1%, significantly outperforming baseline EfficientNet model.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture successfully addresses transfer learning constraints in medical imaging and contributes to developing automated diagnostic tools with improved performance for lumbar spine pathology detection.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new enhanced model architecture to perform classification of lumbar spine degeneration with DICOM images while using a hybrid approach, integrating EfficientNet and VGG19 together with custom-designed components. The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet. This work will present the architectures, preprocessing pipeline, and experimental results. The results contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for medical images.

### [15] [VLMs Guided Interpretable Decision Making for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13881)
*Xin Hu,Taotao Jing,Renran Tian,Zhengming Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using VLMs as semantic enhancers rather than direct decision-makers in autonomous driving, achieving state-of-the-art performance through multi-modal fusion and post-hoc refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based approaches for autonomous driving suffer from inconsistent performance due to handcrafted prompts and limited robustness in real-world scenarios, motivating a shift from direct decision generation to semantic enhancement.

Method: Leverage VLMs' scene understanding to enrich vision-based benchmarks with structured scene descriptions, then use multi-modal interactive architecture to fuse visual and linguistic features, plus a post-hoc refinement module for enhanced reliability.

Result: Extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, showing improved accuracy and interpretable textual explanations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a promising direction for integrating VLMs into reliable and interpretable autonomous driving systems by shifting their role to semantic enhancement rather than direct decision-making.

Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) have explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) within visual question answering (VQA) frameworks for direct driving decision-making. However, these approaches often depend on handcrafted prompts and suffer from inconsistent performance, limiting their robustness and generalization in real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new approach that shifts the role of VLMs from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers. Specifically, we leverage their strong general scene understanding to enrich existing vision-based benchmarks with structured, linguistically rich scene descriptions. Building on this enriched representation, we introduce a multi-modal interactive architecture that fuses visual and linguistic features for more accurate decision-making and interpretable textual explanations. Furthermore, we design a post-hoc refinement module that utilizes VLMs to enhance prediction reliability. Extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a promising direction for integrating VLMs into reliable and interpretable AD systems.

Abstract: The population loss of trained deep neural networks often exhibits power law scaling with the size of the training dataset, guiding significant performance advancements in deep learning applications. In this study, we focus on the scaling relationship with data size in the context of medical anatomical segmentation, a domain that remains underexplored. We analyze scaling laws for anatomical segmentation across 15 semantic tasks and 4 imaging modalities, demonstrating that larger datasets significantly improve segmentation performance, following similar scaling trends. Motivated by the topological isomorphism in images sharing anatomical structures, we evaluate the impact of deformation-guided augmentation strategies on data scaling laws, specifically random elastic deformation and registration-guided deformation. We also propose a novel, scalable image augmentation approach that generates diffeomorphic mappings from geodesic subspace based on image registration to introduce realistic deformation. Our experimental results demonstrate that both registered and generated deformation-based augmentation considerably enhance data utilization efficiency. The proposed generated deformation method notably achieves superior performance and accelerated convergence, surpassing standard power law scaling trends without requiring additional data. Overall, this work provides insights into the understanding of segmentation scalability and topological variation impact in medical imaging, thereby leading to more efficient model development with reduced annotation and computational costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-Hema is a unified multi-task model for digital hematopathology that integrates detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases, outperforming single-task approaches while providing interpretable insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing digital hematopathology models (single-task, vision-language, WSI-optimized, or single-cell) cannot provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of diverse disease categories including leukemia, malaria, and sickle cell disease.

Method: Built on Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at hierarchy level for different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling, visual question answering) at different granularity. Uses 46 public datasets with 700K+ images and 21K+ QA pairs.

Result: Achieves comparable or superior performance to single-task, single-dataset models across diverse hematological tasks while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at single-cell level.

Conclusion: Uni-Hema establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology, overcoming limitations of existing approaches through unified reasoning across disease complexities.

Abstract: Digital hematopathology requires cell-level analysis across diverse disease categories, including malignant disorders (e.g., leukemia), infectious conditions (e.g., malaria), and non-malignant red blood cell disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease). Whether single-task, vision-language, WSI-optimized, or single-cell hematology models, these approaches share a key limitation, they cannot provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of digital hematopathology. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-Hema, a multi-task, unified model for digital hematopathology integrating detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases. Uni-Hema leverages 46 publicly available datasets, encompassing over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs, and is built upon Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at the hierarchy level for the different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling and visual question answer) at different granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to train on a single-task and single dataset models, across diverse hematological tasks, while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level. Our framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology. The code will be made publicly available.

*Seyed Mohamad Ali Tousi,John A. Lory,G. N. DeSouza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First weakly supervised pipeline for ephemeral gully detection using Vision Language Models to reduce manual labeling, with a novel dataset of 18,000+ remote-sensing images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ephemeral gullies are concerning soil erosion phenomena with short temporal cycles, making automatic detection difficult. Scarcity of accurate labeled data limits machine learning approaches to zero-shot methods.

Method: Uses Vision Language Models to generate noisy labels, then applies teacher-student model with weak supervision and noise-aware loss function. Teacher learns from VLM labels, student learns from teacher-generated labels.

Result: Superior performance compared to VLMs and label model alone when using weak supervision to train student model. Experimental results validate the approach.

Conclusion: Weakly supervised pipeline successfully detects ephemeral gullies while reducing manual labeling effort. Dataset and code are publicly available to advance research in this area.

Abstract: Among soil erosion problems, Ephemeral Gullies are one of the most concerning phenomena occurring in agricultural fields. Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model. The code and dataset for this work are made publicly available.

*Mert Onur Cakiroglu,Idil Bilge Altun,Zhihe Lu,Mehmet Dalkilic,Hasan Kurban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using motion vectors from compressed videos to evaluate temporal realism in generative video models, revealing motion artifacts and improving classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative video models have weak temporal realism, and existing metrics focus on spatial appearance with limited sensitivity to motion.

Method: Extract motion vectors from compressed video streams (H.264/HEVC), compute statistical divergences between real and generated videos, and explore MV-RGB fusion methods.

Result: Revealed systematic motion discrepancies in generated videos, with Pika and SVD closest to real motion, and CogVideo showing largest deviations. MV fusion improved classification accuracy up to 99.0%.

Conclusion: Compressed-domain motion vectors effectively diagnose motion defects in generative videos and strengthen temporal reasoning in discriminative models.

Abstract: Temporal realism remains a central weakness of current generative video models, as most evaluation metrics prioritize spatial appearance and offer limited sensitivity to motion. We introduce a scalable, model-agnostic framework that assesses temporal behavior using motion vectors (MVs) extracted directly from compressed video streams. Codec-generated MVs from standards such as H.264 and HEVC provide lightweight, resolution-consistent descriptors of motion dynamics. We quantify realism by computing Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, and Wasserstein divergences between MV statistics of real and generated videos. Experiments on the GenVidBench dataset containing videos from eight state-of-the-art generators reveal systematic discrepancies from real motion: entropy-based divergences rank Pika and SVD as closest to real videos, MV-sum statistics favor VC2 and Text2Video-Zero, and CogVideo shows the largest deviations across both measures. Visualizations of MV fields and class-conditional motion heatmaps further reveal center bias, sparse and piecewise constant flows, and grid-like artifacts that frame-level metrics do not capture. Beyond evaluation, we investigate MV-RGB fusion through channel concatenation, cross-attention, joint embedding, and a motion-aware fusion module. Incorporating MVs improves downstream classification across ResNet, I3D, and TSN backbones, with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 reaching up to 97.4% accuracy and I3D achieving 99.0% accuracy on real-versus-generated discrimination. These findings demonstrate that compressed-domain MVs provide an effective temporal signal for diagnosing motion defects in generative videos and for strengthening temporal reasoning in discriminative models.

TL;DR: SAE-MCVT is the first scalable real-time Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking framework that maintains real-time performance on 2K 15 FPS video streams while achieving competitive accuracy (61.2 IDF1 score), making it suitable for city-scale ITS deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing MCVT studies focus on accuracy but overlook real-time performance and scalability, which are crucial for real-world city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows.

Method: Distributed edge-central architecture: edge devices process video streams (object detection, tracking, geo-mapping, feature extraction) and transmit only lightweight metadata to central workstation, which performs cross-camera association using self-supervised camera link model with spatial-temporal constraints.

Result: Achieves real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams with 61.2 IDF1 score on RoundaboutHD dataset, demonstrating scalability and efficiency.

Conclusion: SAE-MCVT is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework suitable for city-scale deployment, successfully balancing accuracy with real-time performance and scalability requirements.

Abstract: In modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), cameras are a key component due to their ability to provide valuable information for multiple stakeholders. A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation. On the central side, cross-camera association is calculated under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, which are learned through a self-supervised camera link model. Experiments on the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT maintains real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework suitable for city-scale deployment.

In this work, we evaluate how well multi-modal large language models (LLMs) understand road safety concepts, specifically through schematic and illustrative representations. We curate a pilot dataset of images depicting traffic signs and road-safety norms sourced from school text books and use it to evaluate models capabilities in a zero-shot setting. Our preliminary results show that these models struggle with safety reasoning and reveal gaps between human learning and model interpretation. We further provide an analysis of these performance gaps for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-based CoT fine-tuning paradoxically degrades visual grounding performance with lengthy reasoning, and increased dataset size doesn't always help due to varying data complexities.

Method: Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO) that leverages CoT length and gIoU rewards as complexity indicators to structure training data progressively.

Result: Outperforms existing methods including Visual-RFT with up to +12.52 mAP improvement on RefCOCO, shows strong efficiency and robustness in few-shot learning.

Conclusion: CuRPO effectively addresses CoT reasoning degradation in visual grounding and demonstrates superior performance across multiple datasets with exceptional efficiency.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently shown significant promise across various NLP and computer vision tasks by explicitly generating intermediate reasoning steps. However, we find that reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can paradoxically degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks, particularly as CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Additionally, our analysis reveals that increased dataset size does not always enhance performance due to varying data complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), a novel training strategy that leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods, including Visual-RFT, with notable improvements of up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO. Moreover, CuRPO exhibits exceptional efficiency and robustness, delivering strong localization performance even in few-shot learning scenarios, particularly benefiting tasks characterized by ambiguous and intricate textual descriptions.The code is released on https://github.com/qyoung-yan/CuRPO.

TL;DR: Pretraining vision transformers on procedurally-generated data without visual content improves data efficiency and performance when followed by standard image training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To instill generic inductive biases in vision transformers that are beneficial across modalities by using procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content.

Method: Generate procedurally-generated data using simple algorithms like formal grammars, pretrain ViTs on this data while bypassing visual patch embedding mechanisms, then follow with standard image-based training.

Result: 1% of training budget allocated to procedural data improves ImageNet-1k accuracy by over 1.7%, with 1% procedural data being equivalent to 28% of ImageNet-1k data in terms of performance impact.

Conclusion: Procedurally-generated data pretraining offers a promising path toward data-efficient and domain-agnostic pretraining strategies for vision transformers.

Abstract: Transformers show remarkable versatility across domains, suggesting the existence of inductive biases beneficial across modalities. In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data. These findings suggest a promising path toward new data-efficient and domain-agnostic pretraining strategies.

Motivation: To develop a robust and efficient cell segmentation method that can handle outliers in training data while providing sharp cell boundaries, with applications in edge computing due to low memory and energy requirements.

Method: Learn continuous scalar fields on image domains using trained networks, where fields are solutions to Poisson PDE and heat equation diffusion. Segmentation is performed using watershed method on these fields without needing regularization.

Result: Competitive results on public datasets showing excellent cell segmentation with simplified implementation, lower training/inference times, reduced energy consumption, and small memory footprint.

Conclusion: The proposed simple yet geometrically insightful approach using scalar fields and watershed segmentation achieves excellent cell segmentation results while being efficient and suitable for edge computing applications.

Abstract: We investigate image segmentation of cells under the lens of scalar fields. Our goal is to learn a continuous scalar field on image domains such that its segmentation produces robust instances for cells present in images. This field is a function parameterized by the trained network, and its segmentation is realized by the watershed method. The fields we experiment with are solutions to the Poisson partial differential equation and a diffusion mimicking the steady-state solution of the heat equation. These solutions are obtained by minimizing just the field residuals, no regularization is needed, providing a robust regression capable of diminishing the adverse impacts of outliers in the training data and allowing for sharp cell boundaries. A single tensor is all that is needed to train a \unet\ thus simplifying implementation, lowering training and inference times, hence reducing energy consumption, and requiring a small memory footprint, all attractive features in edge computing. We present competitive results on public datasets from the literature and show that our novel, simple yet geometrically insightful approach can achieve excellent cell segmentation results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models for skill assessment from video specialize in individual sports and suffer from high costs and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports.

Method: Discovers skill-attributes that transcend sport boundaries (e.g., balance, control, hand positioning), then trains a multimodal language model to generate feedback and proficiency levels.

Result: Achieves gains up to 60% relative to state-of-the-art in both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: By abstracting shared behaviors indicative of human skill, the proposed video representation generalizes better than existing techniques and enriches multimodal large language models.

Abstract: Skill assessment from video entails rating the quality of a person's physical performance and explaining what could be done better. Today's models specialize for an individual sport, and suffer from the high cost and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports. Towards closing that gap, we explore transferable video representations for skill assessment. Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., "lift hands more to generate more power" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert. We validate the new model on multiple datasets for both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings, where it achieves gains up to 60% relative to the state of the art. By abstracting out the shared behaviors indicative of human skill, the proposed video representation generalizes substantially better than an array of existing techniques, enriching today's multimodal large language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-prompt expert network using convolutional dictionary feature decoupling for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution, which separates features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components and uses frequency/adaptive routing prompts for optimal feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-contrast MRI super-resolution aims to reconstruct high-resolution images using reference images from different contrasts, but contrast disparities between modalities make it challenging to effectively utilize reference textures, leading to suboptimal feature integration.

Method: Proposes CD-DPE with iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features, and dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) using frequency prompt for feature selection and adaptive routing prompt for optimal fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments show CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities on unseen datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed CD-DPE framework effectively addresses contrast disparities in multi-contrast MRI super-resolution through feature decoupling and intelligent prompt-based fusion, achieving superior reconstruction quality and generalization.

Abstract: Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) super-resolution intends to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) scans by leveraging structural information present in HR reference images acquired with different contrasts. This technique enhances anatomical detail and soft tissue differentiation, which is vital for early diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, inherent contrasts disparities between modalities pose fundamental challenges in effectively utilizing reference image textures to guide target image reconstruction, often resulting in suboptimal feature integration. To address this issue, we propose a dual-prompt expert network based on a convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-DPE) strategy for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution. Specifically, we introduce an iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components, thereby reducing redundancy and interference. To fully integrate these features, a novel dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) is proposed. This module uses a frequency prompt to guide the selection of relevant reference features for incorporation into the target image, while an adaptive routing prompt determines the optimal method for fusing reference and target features to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets demonstrate that CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details. Additionally, experiments on unseen datasets demonstrated that CD-DPE exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: RISE is the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding that uses multipath reflections to reconstruct layouts and detect objects, achieving 60% improvement in layout reconstruction and enabling first mmWave-based object detection with 58% IoU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical sensors like RGB and LiDAR have privacy risks and occlusion issues in indoor environments, while mmWave radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles but has low spatial resolution, making reliable geometric reasoning difficult.

Method: Uses Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement to model Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary reflections, combined with a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework to transform fragmented radar responses into complete scene understanding.

Result: Reduces Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to state-of-the-art in layout reconstruction, and achieves 58% IoU for mmWave-based object detection - the first such demonstration.

Conclusion: RISE establishes a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar, leveraging multipath reflections traditionally treated as noise.

Abstract: Robust and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding remains a fundamental open problem. While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.
  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.
  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU. These results establish RISE as a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar.

*SangHyuk Kim,Daniel Haehn,Sumientra Rampersad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Developed a 2.5D context-aware classifier for MRI plane orientation that achieves 99.49% accuracy, reducing errors by 60% compared to 2D models, and improves brain tumor detection accuracy by 1% when integrated via uncertainty-based gating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated systems struggle to identify anatomical planes (axial, coronal, sagittal) on 2D MRI slices, and missing plane orientation metadata complicates analysis, increases domain shift in heterogeneous datasets, and reduces diagnostic classifier accuracy.

Method: Adopted a 2.5D context-aware model using multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices. Trained on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images, with validation in brain tumor detection using uncertainty-based gating strategy.

Result: 2.5D model achieved 99.49% accuracy vs 98.74% for 2D reference model, reducing errors by 60%. In brain tumor detection, metadata-enhanced predictions boosted accuracy from 97.0% to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%.

Conclusion: 2.5D context is crucial for accurate plane orientation detection, and the generated metadata significantly improves downstream diagnostic tasks when integrated via uncertainty-aware strategies. The model is available as open-source web application.

Abstract: Humans can easily identify anatomical planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) on a 2D MRI slice, but automated systems struggle with this task. Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%. We integrate our plane orientation model into an interactive web application and provide it open-source.

*Md Shazid Islam,Shreyangshu Bera,Sudipta Paul,Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LINGUAL is a framework that uses natural language instructions to automate medical image segmentation tasks, reducing annotation effort by ~80% while maintaining performance comparable to active learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active learning in medical image segmentation is labor-intensive and cognitively demanding due to blurry boundaries. Language guidance offers a less demanding alternative to precise boundary delineation.

Method: LINGUAL receives natural language instructions from experts, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs corresponding sub-tasks without human intervention.

Result: LINGUAL achieves comparable or superior performance to active learning baselines in active domain adaptation while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.

Conclusion: Language-guided frameworks like LINGUAL provide an effective alternative to traditional active learning, significantly reducing expert annotation burden while maintaining segmentation performance.

Abstract: Although active learning (AL) in segmentation tasks enables experts to annotate selected regions of interest (ROIs) instead of entire images, it remains highly challenging, labor-intensive, and cognitively demanding due to the blurry and ambiguous boundaries commonly observed in medical images. Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LINGUAL in active domain adaptation (ADA) achieving comparable or superior performance to AL baselines while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.

*Sungik Choi,Hankook Lee,Moontae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaRPAD is a training-free AI-generated image detection method that uses self-supervised models' sensitivity to resolution changes and high-frequency perturbations to distinguish real from AI-generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated image detectors require training on specific datasets, but WaRPAD aims for a training-free approach that doesn't need prior data knowledge by leveraging properties of self-supervised models trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop.

Method: WaRPAD uses self-supervised models to compute sensitivity scores to high-frequency perturbations via Haar wavelet decomposition. It rescales images to multiples of model input size, divides into patches, computes base scores for each patch, and averages them for final detection.

Result: WaRPAD achieves competitive performance on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and detects images from 23 different generative models. It shows strong robustness to test-time corruptions and works across various self-supervised models.

Conclusion: WaRPAD provides an effective training-free solution for AI-generated image detection that leverages inherent properties of self-supervised models, demonstrating broad applicability and robustness across different generative models and image domains.

Abstract: AI-generated image detection has become crucial with the rapid advancement of vision-generative models. Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FashionMAC is a diffusion-based framework for garment-centric fashion image generation that preserves garment details without deformation and enables fine-grained control over model appearance using region-adaptive attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from garment texture distortions due to deformation requirements and lack fine-grained controllability over generated models' appearance attributes.

Method: Proposes a deformation-free framework that directly outpaints segmented garments, uses region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) with chained mask injection to control fine-grained attributes.

Result: Achieves high-quality fashion showcase generation with faithful garment preservation and superior fine-grained controllability compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FashionMAC effectively addresses key challenges in garment-centric fashion generation by eliminating deformation and enabling precise attribute control through novel attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Garment-centric fashion image generation aims to synthesize realistic and controllable human models dressing a given garment, which has attracted growing interest due to its practical applications in e-commerce. The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Method: Proposes a novel approach using latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, incorporating physics-informed inputs to enhance interpretability and using transfer learning for adaptation to new geographic regions.

Result: Latent diffusion models substantially decrease computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising accuracy, enabling real-time flood risk management, and exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations.

Conclusion: The proposed latent diffusion model approach enables accurate, fast, and generalizable flood map generation suitable for real-time flood risk management applications, while addressing black-box limitations through physics-informed inputs.

Abstract: Flood prediction is critical for emergency planning and response to mitigate human and economic losses. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models generate high-resolution flood maps using numerical methods requiring fine-grid discretization; which are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications. While recent studies have applied convolutional neural networks for flood map super-resolution with good accuracy and speed, they suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, with the objective of achieving the accuracy of fine-grid flood maps while significantly reducing inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that latent diffusion models substantially decrease the computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising on accuracy, enabling their use in real-time flood risk management. Moreover, diffusion models exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations, with transfer learning further accelerating adaptation to new geographic regions. Our approach also incorporates physics-informed inputs, addressing the common limitation of black-box behavior in machine learning, thereby enhancing interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly object detection and classification are challenging tasks in computer vision, particularly for infrastructure inspection where automated defect detection can improve safety and efficiency.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Saliency-based defect region proposals to identify local discontinuities in surface patterns, 2) YOLOX-based deep learning detector applied to saliency-enhanced images with bounding-box level brightness augmentation.

Result: Experimental results on standard datasets confirm good performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework shows potential for implementation in self-powered inspection systems due to its accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Anomaly object detection and classification are one of the main challenging tasks in computer vision and pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a new method to automatically detect, localize and classify defects in concrete bridge structures using drone imagery. This framework is constituted of two main stages. The first stage uses saliency for defect region proposals where defects often exhibit local discontinuities in the normal surface patterns with regard to their surrounding. The second stage employs a YOLOX-based deep learning detector that operates on saliency-enhanced images obtained by applying bounding-box level brightness augmentation to salient defect regions. Experimental results on standard datasets confirm the performance of our framework and its suitability in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, which give a huge potential to be implemented in a self-powered inspection system.

*Dongyang Jin,Ryan Xu,Jianhao Zeng,Rui Lan,Yancheng Bai,Lei Sun,Xiangxiang Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCAR is a semantic-context-driven method for autoregressive image editing that introduces compressed semantic prefilling and semantic alignment guidance to improve instruction adherence and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models show promise for image generation but struggle with general image editing due to weak conditioning, poor instruction adherence, and visual artifacts.

Method: Proposes SCAR with two components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling (encoding high-level semantics into compact prefix) and Semantic Alignment Guidance (aligning visual hidden states with target semantics during decoding).

Result: SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods.

Conclusion: SCAR effectively addresses conditioning limitations in AR models for image editing while maintaining controllability and generalizing across different AR paradigms.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have shown strong potential in image generation, offering better scalability and easier integration with unified multi-modal systems compared to diffusion-based methods. However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability. All code will be released.

*Jingyu Lei,Gaoang Wang,Der-Horng Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORE introduces object-centric visual token compression for LVLMs using segmentation masks to guide token merging, achieving state-of-the-art performance with extreme compression (2.2% tokens while maintaining 97.4% baseline performance).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational and memory inefficiencies in LVLMs caused by quadratic growth of visual tokens with image resolution, overcoming limitations of existing token compression methods that lack high-level semantic understanding.

Method: Uses efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks as semantic prior for merging visual tokens into compact object-centric representations, with centroid-guided sorting to restore spatial order.

Result: Establishes new SOTA on six benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings, and maintains 97.4% baseline performance with only 2.2% of visual tokens.

Conclusion: Demonstrates superiority of object-centric representations for efficient and effective LVLM processing, providing a new paradigm for visual token compression.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually suffer from prohibitive computational and memory costs due to the quadratic growth of visual tokens with image resolution. Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information. Extensive experiments show that CORE not only establishes a new state-of-the-art on six authoritative benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, but also achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings. Even under extreme compression, after aggressively retaining with only 2.2% of all visual tokens, CORE still maintains 97.4% of baseline performance. Our work demonstrates the superiority of object-centric representations for efficient and effective LVLM processing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS) using a generative engine to directly synthesize classifier parameters from minimal inputs (1-shot image + text), eliminating need for training and achieving SOTA on few-shot medical classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome dependency on large annotated datasets in medical AI, especially for rare diseases where data is scarce and expert annotation is expensive.

Method: Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS) uses pre-trained generative engine to synthesize entire classifier parameters from minimal multi-modal inputs (single image + clinical text), generating weights for efficient classifiers like EfficientNet-V2 without training.

Result: Establishes new SOTA on ISIC 2018 skin lesion and rare disease datasets, significantly outperforming few-shot and zero-shot methods, especially in 1-shot and 5-shot regimes.

Conclusion: Enables rapid deployment of AI diagnostic tools for rare diseases with limited data, paving way for practical medical AI applications without traditional training requirements.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis but are fundamentally constrained by the requirement for large-scale, meticulously annotated datasets. This dependency on "big data" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.
  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification. This work paves the way for the rapid development and deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools, particularly for the long tail of rare diseases where data is critically limited.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on 3D CT scans using U-Net segmentation, landmark detection, and geometric fitting methods, showing strong agreement with manual measurements and exceeding surgeon-to-surgeon consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual and semi-automated methods for measuring glenoid bone loss are time-consuming and subject to interreader variability, creating a need for more reliable and efficient automated solutions.

Method: Multi-stage algorithm with three main stages: (1) U-Net segmentation of glenoid and humerus, (2) neural network prediction of glenoid rim points, (3) PCA, projection, and circle fitting for bone loss calculation using linear-based en-face view best-circle method.

Result: Automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings (ICC 0.84 vs 0.78 for surgeons), performed well in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21), and achieved good classification recall (0.714 for low, 0.857 for high severity).

Conclusion: The method provides a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss, with code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEER-3D is an error-driven framework that uses targeted 3D scene editing to generate counterfactual examples for fine-tuning 3D-LLMs, addressing grounding biases through predicate-level error diagnosis and minimal spatial manipulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D-LLMs struggle with accurate language-to-visual/spatial grounding due to training data biases and limited 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding issues unresolved.

Method: DEER-3D follows a "Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train" workflow: identifies grounding failures, diagnoses predicate-level errors (attributes/spatial relations), performs minimal 3D scene edits (recoloring/repositioning), and generates targeted counterfactuals for iterative fine-tuning.

Result: The framework consistently improves grounding accuracy across multiple 3D grounding and scene understanding benchmarks through iterative refinement, demonstrating effectiveness in bridging linguistic reasoning with spatial understanding.

Conclusion: Targeted, error-driven scene editing is an effective approach for enhancing 3D-LLMs' grounding capabilities, bridging the gap between language reasoning and spatial understanding without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale data collection.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D-LLMs, they remain limited in accurately grounding language to visual and spatial elements in 3D environments. This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured "Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement. DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of U-Net architectures in capturing long-range dependencies and transformer-based models' heavy computational requirements and large dataset needs.

Method: Integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks, using grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations.

Result: Achieved Dice scores of 86.11% on Synapse dataset and 92.64% on ACDC dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: GCA provides a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability for high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation underpins computer-aided diagnosis and therapy by supporting clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and disease monitoring. While U-Net style convolutional neural networks perform well due to their encoder-decoder structures with skip connections, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Transformer-based variants address global context but often require heavy computation and large training datasets. This paper proposes GCA-ResUNet, an efficient segmentation network that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations, strengthening feature representation and boundary delineation while adding minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared with self-attention. On the Synapse dataset, GCA-ResUNet achieves a Dice score of 86.11%, and on the ACDC dataset, it reaches 92.64%, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency. These results indicate that GCA offers a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMGeo is a promptable end-to-end transformer model for cross-view object geo-localization that uses click prompting for interactive use, achieves state-of-the-art performance on drone-to-satellite tasks, and employs a grid-level sparse mixture-of-experts for adaptive feature processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-stage 'retrieval-matching' pipelines for cross-view object geo-localization suffer from cumulative errors due to significant viewpoint and scale differences, along with complex background interference between drone and satellite imagery.

Method: Uses a fully transformer-based architecture with Swin-Transformer for joint feature encoding, grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE) for adaptive expert activation based on content/scale/source, and anchor-free transformer detection head with heat-map supervision for coordinate regression.

Result: Achieves leading performance on drone-to-satellite task: 87.51% accuracy at IoU=0.25, 62.50% mIoU, and 61.45% in test set, significantly outperforming DetGeo (61.97%, 57.66%, 54.05%). Ablation studies confirm gains from shared encoding, query-guided fusion, and GMoE.

Conclusion: SMGeo provides an effective end-to-end solution for cross-view geo-localization that supports interactive prompting, avoids anchor-based limitations, and achieves state-of-the-art performance through adaptive expert activation and transformer-based architecture.

Abstract: Cross-view object Geo-localization aims to precisely pinpoint the same object across large-scale satellite imagery based on drone images. Due to significant differences in viewpoint and scale, coupled with complex background interference, traditional multi-stage "retrieval-matching" pipelines are prone to cumulative errors. To address this, we present SMGeo, a promptable end-to-end transformer-based model for object Geo-localization. This model supports click prompting and can output object Geo-localization in real time when prompted to allow for interactive use. The model employs a fully transformer-based architecture, utilizing a Swin-Transformer for joint feature encoding of both drone and satellite imagery and an anchor-free transformer detection head for coordinate regression. In order to better capture both inter-modal and intra-view dependencies, we introduce a grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE) into the cross-view encoder, allowing it to adaptively activate specialized experts according to the content, scale and source of each grid. We also employ an anchor-free detection head for coordinate regression, directly predicting object locations via heat-map supervision in the reference images. This approach avoids scale bias and matching complexity introduced by predefined anchor boxes. On the drone-to-satellite task, SMGeo achieves leading performance in accuracy at IoU=0.25 and mIoU metrics (e.g., 87.51%, 62.50%, and 61.45% in the test set, respectively), significantly outperforming representative methods such as DetGeo (61.97%, 57.66%, and 54.05%, respectively). Ablation studies demonstrate complementary gains from shared encoding, query-guided fusion, and grid-level sparse mixture-of-experts.

*Weijia Fan,Qiufu Li,Jiajun Wen,Xiaoyang Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BCE3S: A binary cross-entropy based tripartite synergistic learning method for long-tailed recognition that achieves better feature compactness, separability, and balanced classifier vectors than traditional cross-entropy approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-entropy methods struggle with imbalanced classifier vectors and poor feature properties in long-tailed recognition tasks, where both head and tail classes need high intra-class compactness and inter-class separability.

Method: Three-component BCE-based approach: (1) joint learning for feature and classifier optimization via multiple Sigmoid, (2) contrastive learning for intra-class compactness, (3) uniform learning for balanced classifier separability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018 datasets with improved feature compactness, separability, and balanced classifier vectors.

Conclusion: BCE3S effectively addresses long-tailed recognition challenges by decoupling imbalanced classifier metrics and synergistically combining three BCE-based learning components to achieve superior performance.

Abstract: For long-tailed recognition (LTR) tasks, high intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in both head and tail classes, as well as balanced separability among all the classifier vectors, are preferred. The existing LTR methods based on cross-entropy (CE) loss not only struggle to learn features with desirable properties but also couple imbalanced classifier vectors in the denominator of its Softmax, amplifying the imbalance effects in LTR. In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.

Motivation: Existing All-in-One Image Restoration methods rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making them hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. A more unified and interpretable approach is needed.

Method: Uses frozen Multimodal Large Language Model as planner to analyze degraded images and generate frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts module within diffusion-based executor, with adversarial training and frequency regularization loss to improve quality.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.

Conclusion: FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration by coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AIO-IR) aims to develop a unified model that can handle multiple degradations under complex conditions. However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration. Extensive experiments show that FAPE-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.

*Yiqing Shen,Chenjia Li,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIVER is a reasoning-based implicit video editing model that interprets implicit text queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods require explicit descriptions with precise spatial and temporal specifications, which becomes impractical when users want to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships.

Method: RIVER decouples reasoning from generation using digital twin representations of video content, processes these with LLMs for multi-hop reasoning, and outputs structured instructions to guide a diffusion-based editor. Training uses reinforcement learning with reasoning accuracy and generation quality rewards.

Result: RIVER achieves best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark (100 videos with 519 implicit queries) and state-of-the-art performance on VegGIE and FiVE benchmarks, surpassing six baseline methods.

Conclusion: RIVER successfully addresses the reasoning video editing task by interpreting implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning and demonstrates superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Text-driven video editing enables users to modify video content only using text queries. While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing. RIVER demonstrates best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on two additional video editing benchmarks (VegGIE and FiVE), where it surpasses six baseline methods.

Conclusion: RTS-Mono successfully addresses the computational efficiency vs. performance trade-off in monocular depth estimation, enabling practical real-world deployment in resource-constrained environments like autonomous vehicles and robots.

Abstract: Depth information is crucial for autonomous driving and intelligent robot navigation. The simplicity and flexibility of self-supervised monocular depth estimation are conducive to its role in these fields. However, most existing monocular depth estimation models consume many computing resources. Although some methods have reduced the model's size and improved computing efficiency, the performance deteriorates, seriously hindering the real-world deployment of self-supervised monocular depth estimation models in the real world. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time self-supervised monocular depth estimation method and implemented it in the real world. It is called RTS-Mono, which is a lightweight and efficient encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is based on Lite-Encoder, and the decoder is designed with a multi-scale sparse fusion framework to minimize redundancy, ensure performance, and improve inference speed. RTS-Mono achieved state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in high and low resolutions with extremely low parameter counts (3 M) in experiments based on the KITTI dataset. Compared with lightweight methods, RTS-Mono improved Abs Rel and Sq Rel by 5.6% and 9.8% at low resolution and improved Sq Rel and RMSE by 6.1% and 1.9% at high resolution.

TL;DR: A^2GC-VPR: An asymmetric aggregation method with geometric constraints for Visual Place Recognition that addresses distributional discrepancies between image features and cluster centers through separate marginal calibration and spatial awareness enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard optimal transport methods symmetrically treat source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers have substantially different distributions in visual place recognition tasks.

Method: Proposed asymmetric aggregation with row-column normalization averaging and separate marginal calibration, incorporating geometric constraints through learnable coordinate embeddings that compute compatibility scores fused with feature similarities.

Result: Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating improved matching accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The asymmetric aggregation approach with geometric constraints effectively handles distributional discrepancies and enhances spatial awareness, leading to significant improvements in visual place recognition performance.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to match query images against a database using visual cues. State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness. Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in improving matching accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: Coffee is a method that uses language to specify undesired concepts during fine-tuning of text-to-image diffusion models, preventing them from learning unwanted concepts without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for text-to-image models can learn undesired concepts from training data and entangle them with user prompts, which is problematic for bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, and attribute disentanglement.

Method: Coffee keeps user prompt embeddings from aligning with undesired concepts by using language descriptions to regularize the adaptation process, requiring no additional training and allowing flexible modification of undesired concepts.

Result: Experimental results show Coffee effectively prevents text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: Coffee provides an effective solution for controllable fine-tuning of diffusion models by using language to specify and prevent learning of undesired concepts, enabling safer and more reliable model customization.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate diverse content with flexible prompts, which makes them well-suited for customization through fine-tuning with a small amount of user-provided data. However, controllable fine-tuning that prevents models from learning undesired concepts present in the fine-tuning data, and from entangling those concepts with user prompts, remains an open challenge. It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts. Crucially, Coffee requires no additional training and enables flexible modification of undesired concepts by modifying textual descriptions. We evaluate Coffee by fine-tuning on images associated with user prompts paired with undesired concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that Coffee can prevent text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.

*Hao Zhen,Yunxiang Yang,Jidong J. Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MP-PVIR is a framework that analyzes multi-view pedestrian-vehicle incidents by segmenting them into cognitive phases and generating diagnostic reports with prevention strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video systems detect incidents but lack insight into how they unfold across pedestrian cognitive phases, and current VLMs process videos in isolation without temporal structuring or multi-view integration.

Method: Four-stage framework: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation using TG-VLM, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning using PhaVR-VLM, (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning using LLM.

Result: TG-VLM achieves mIoU = 0.4881 for phase segmentation; PhaVR-VLM achieves captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% QA accuracy; framework generates comprehensive diagnostic reports from multi-view video data.

Conclusion: MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights for traffic safety analytics, advancing AI-driven vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.

Abstract: Pedestrian-vehicle incidents remain a critical urban safety challenge, with pedestrians accounting for over 20% of global traffic fatalities. Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.

TL;DR: Convolution and self-attention are unified under a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework, where convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity and attention by feature similarity, existing on a continuous spectrum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the apparent distinction between convolutional neural networks and transformers by showing both convolution and self-attention can be viewed as special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation.

Method: Introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN) framework that serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes.

Result: ConvNN improves accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 in both VGG (hybrid branching) and ViT architectures, outperforming standard attention and other variants, with ablations showing regularization benefits from balancing local and global receptive fields.

Conclusion: The work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the distinction between convolution and attention, with implications for designing more principled and interpretable vision architectures.

Abstract: The shift from Convolutional Neural Networks to Transformers has reshaped computer vision, yet these two architectural families are typically viewed as fundamentally distinct. We argue that convolution and self-attention, despite their apparent differences, can be unified within a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework. The critical insight is that both operations are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation; convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity, while attention selects by feature similarity, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum. We introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN), a unified framework that formalizes this connection. Crucially, ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes. We validate the framework's coherence on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks across two complementary architectures: (1) Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets by combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; and (2) ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Extensive ablations on $k$ values and architectural variants reveal that interpolating along this spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields. Our work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the apparent distinction between convolution and attention, with implications for designing more principled and interpretable vision architectures.

TL;DR: SMART is a Multimodal Large Language Model framework that improves video moment retrieval by integrating audio cues and shot-level temporal structure with selective token compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video moment retrieval methods rely on coarse temporal understanding and single visual modality, limiting performance on complex videos.

Method: Integrates audio and visual features, applies Shot-aware Token Compression to selectively retain high-information tokens within shots, and refines prompt design for better audio-visual cue utilization.

Result: Achieves significant improvements: 1.61% increase in R1@0.5 and 2.59% gain in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA, with strong performance on QVHighlights.

Conclusion: SMART demonstrates that integrating audio cues and shot-level temporal structure with selective token compression significantly enhances video moment retrieval performance.

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval is a task in video understanding that aims to localize a specific temporal segment in an untrimmed video based on a natural language query. Despite recent progress in moment retrieval from videos using both traditional techniques and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), most existing methods still rely on coarse temporal understanding and a single visual modality, limiting performance on complex videos. To address this, we introduce \textit{S}hot-aware \textit{M}ultimodal \textit{A}udio-enhanced \textit{R}etrieval of \textit{T}emporal \textit{S}egments (SMART), an MLLM-based framework that integrates audio cues and leverages shot-level temporal structure. SMART enriches multimodal representations by combining audio and visual features while applying \textbf{Shot-aware Token Compression}, which selectively retains high-information tokens within each shot to reduce redundancy and preserve fine-grained temporal details. We also refine prompt design to better utilize audio-visual cues. Evaluations on Charades-STA and QVHighlights show that SMART achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including a 1.61\% increase in R1@0.5 and 2.59\% gain in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera pose estimation methods rely on computationally expensive iterative render-compare-refine loops that hinder real-time performance in robotics applications.

Method: Two-stage feed-forward framework: 1) coarse 6DoF pose regression using Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention, 2) refinement through feature matching and multi-model fusion with cross-correlation module and Weighted Multiview Predictor.

Result: Reduces median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, with 10x speedup compared to optimization-based approaches on NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T&T+DB datasets.

Conclusion: iGaussian enables real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion without differentiable rendering, making it suitable for robotics applications requiring fast and accurate pose estimation.

Abstract: Recent trends in SLAM and visual navigation have embraced 3D Gaussians as the preferred scene representation, highlighting the importance of estimating camera poses from a single image using a pre-built Gaussian model. However, existing approaches typically rely on an iterative \textit{render-compare-refine} loop, where candidate views are first rendered using NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, then compared against the target image, and finally, discrepancies are used to update the pose. This multi-round process incurs significant computational overhead, hindering real-time performance in robotics. In this paper, we propose iGaussian, a two-stage feed-forward framework that achieves real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion. Our method first regresses a coarse 6DoF pose using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention mechanisms, then refines it through feature matching and multi-model fusion. The key contribution lies in our cross-correlation module that aligns image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, coupled with a Weighted Multiview Predictor that fuses features from Multiple strategically sampled viewpoints. Experimental results on the NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\&T+DB datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement over previous methods, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, which is an impressive 10 times speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

Conclusion: Wave-Former demonstrates impressive generalization to real-world data and significantly improves 3D reconstruction accuracy for occluded objects using mmWave signals.

Abstract: We present Wave-Former, a novel method capable of high-accuracy 3D shape reconstruction for completely occluded, diverse, everyday objects. This capability can open new applications spanning robotics, augmented reality, and logistics. Our approach leverages millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless signals, which can penetrate common occlusions and reflect off hidden objects. In contrast to past mmWave reconstruction methods, which suffer from limited coverage and high noise, Wave-Former introduces a physics-aware shape completion model capable of inferring full 3D geometry. At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection. This enables Wave-Former to be trained using entirely synthetic point-clouds, while demonstrating impressive generalization to real-world data.In head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines, Wave-Former raises recall from 54% to 72% while maintaining a high precision of 85%.

TL;DR: RiSe framework addresses multimodal face anti-spoofing cross-domain generalization by tackling modal representation and synergy invariant risks through asymmetric invariant risk minimization and multimodal synergy disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal FAS methods suffer severe performance degradation in unseen domains due to two overlooked risks: modal representation invariant risk (class asymmetry amplifies generalization error) and modal synergy invariant risk (overfitting to domain-specific inter-modal correlations).

Method: Proposes RiSe framework with two components: 1) Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM) that learns invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space for asymmetric distributions while preserving domain cues in angular space; 2) Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD) using self-supervised cross-sample mixing and disentanglement to enhance generalizable modal features.

Result: RiSe achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance in multimodal face anti-spoofing, verified through theoretical analysis and experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed RiSe framework effectively addresses the two key risks in multimodal FAS cross-domain generalization, providing a provable solution that outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) methods, which integrate multiple visual modalities, often suffer even more severe performance degradation than unimodal FAS when deployed in unseen domains. This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space. For synergy risk, RiSe employs Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD), a self-supervised task enhancing intrinsic, generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement. Theoretical analysis and experiments verify RiSe, which achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance.

Motivation: Existing robustness benchmarks focus on hallucination or misleading text, but overlook misleading visual inputs which are equally critical for assessing visual understanding in LVLMs.

Method: Created MVI-Bench with three hierarchical levels (Visual Concept, Attribute, Relationship), curated six categories of misleading visual inputs, and introduced MVI-Sensitivity metric for fine-grained robustness evaluation.

Result: Empirical evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs revealed pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, demonstrating significant robustness issues.

Conclusion: MVI-Bench provides actionable insights for developing more reliable LVLMs and addresses a critical gap in visual understanding robustness evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) is essential for their continued development and responsible deployment in real-world applications. However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench.

### [57] [AdaTok: Adaptive Token Compression with Object-Aware Representations for Efficient Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14169)
*Xinliang Zhang,Lei Zhu,Hangzhou He,Shuang Zeng,Ourui Fu,Jiakui Hu,Zhengjian Yao,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an object-level token merging strategy for adaptive token compression in MLLMs, achieving 90% token reduction while maintaining 96% of vanilla model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-level tokenization in MLLMs causes quadratic token growth, computational burden, and misalignment with human vision cognition, leading to hallucination and redundancy.

Method: Object-level token merging strategy for adaptive token compression that aligns with human vision system.

Result: Achieves average 10% token usage while maintaining 96% of vanilla model performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming relevant works in balancing compression and performance.

Conclusion: The proposed object-level token compression method effectively reduces computational burden while preserving performance, demonstrating superiority over existing approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial value in unified text-image understanding and reasoning, primarily by converting images into sequences of patch-level tokens that align with their architectural paradigm. However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance. More extensive experimental results in comparison with relevant works demonstrate the superiority of our method in balancing compression ratio and performance. Our code will be available.

*Yanshan Li,Ke Ma,Miaomiao Wei,Linhui Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGCLR is a self-supervised contrastive learning framework for skeleton-based action recognition that uses game theory to dynamically balance positive and negative sample construction, with spatio-temporal localization and entropy-driven memory management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods process all skeleton regions uniformly and use FIFO queues for negative samples, leading to motion information loss and suboptimal negative sample selection.

Method: Models sample construction as a Dominance Game with spatio-temporal dual weight localization for key motion regions and entropy-driven dominance strategy for memory bank management.

Result: Achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy on NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View and 71.2%/75.5% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, surpassing SOTA by 0.1%-2.7%. On PKU-MMD Part II, achieves 1.9% higher accuracy.

Conclusion: DoGCLR demonstrates strong robustness in challenging scenarios and effectively addresses motion information loss and negative sample optimization through game-theoretic approach.

Abstract: Existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods for skeleton-based action recognition often process all skeleton regions uniformly, and adopt a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue to store negative samples, which leads to motion information loss and non-optimal negative sample selection. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets. On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, DoGCLR achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy, and on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, DoGCLR achieves 71.2%/75.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively. On PKU-MMD Part I/Part II, DoGCLR performs comparably to the state-of-the-art methods and achieves a 1.9% higher accuracy on Part II, highlighting its strong robustness on more challenging scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniSER is a foundational versatile model that addresses diverse image degradations from soft effects (lens flare, haze, shadows, reflections) in a single framework, outperforming both specialist and generalist models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches use highly specialized models for individual degradation types, lacking scalability and failing to exploit shared underlying essences of restoration problems, while generalist models require detailed prompts and often fail at robust removal or scene preservation.

Method: Curated a massive 3.8M-pair dataset with novel physically-plausible data, fine-tuned a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors, and integrated fine-grained mask and strength controls.

Result: UniSER significantly outperforms both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses diverse soft effect degradations within a single framework by leveraging their common essence as semi-transparent occlusions and using a synergistic training methodology.

Abstract: Digital images are often degraded by soft effects such as lens flare, haze, shadows, and reflections, which reduce aesthetics even though the underlying pixels remain partially visible. The prevailing works address these degradations in isolation, developing highly specialized, specialist models that lack scalability and fail to exploit the shared underlying essences of these restoration problems. While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene. Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls. This synergistic approach allows UniSER to significantly outperform both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild.

*Xuan Zhao,Zhongyu Zhang,Yuge Huang,Yuxi Mi,Guodong Mu,Shouhong Ding,Jun Wang,Rizen Guo,Shuigeng Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GloTok introduces a global perspective tokenizer that uses codebook-wise histogram relation learning to create more uniform semantic distributions for better image generation, achieving SOTA results on ImageNet-1k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image tokenization methods use local semantic supervision, which limits semantic distribution uniformity. Since VA-VAE shows that more uniform feature distributions yield better generation performance, the authors aim to develop a method that models more uniform semantic distributions.

Method: Proposes Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok) with: 1) Codebook-wise histogram relation learning to transfer dataset-wide semantics to semantic codebook, 2) Residual learning module to recover fine-grained details and minimize quantization reconstruction error.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality on ImageNet-1k benchmark. Produces more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations that facilitate autoregressive model training without requiring pre-trained models during training.

Conclusion: GloTok successfully creates more uniform semantic distributions through global relational modeling, enabling high-quality image generation and reconstruction while eliminating the need for direct access to pre-trained models during training.

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art image tokenization methods leverage diverse semantic features from pre-trained vision models for additional supervision, to expand the distribution of latent representations and thereby improve the quality of image reconstruction and generation. These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process. Experiments on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark clearly show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality.

TL;DR: First end-to-end autonomous driving dataset collected entirely by autonomous vehicles in real-world conditions, providing synchronized sensor data, trajectories, and detailed annotations for safety evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets collected by human drivers are insufficient for evaluating real behavioral safety of autonomous vehicles, as they don't capture autonomous driving behaviors and scenarios.

Method: Collected over 100 hours of naturalistic data from production autonomous vehicles, segmented into 32,727 key frames with synchronized camera images, GNSS/IMU data, and 20Hz vehicle trajectories spanning past 6s and future 5s.

Result: Dataset provides rich scenario attributes including driver intent, area types, lighting, weather, traffic density, and detailed 2D annotations. Motion planning model achieves 1.4m Average Displacement Error on autonomous driving frames.

Conclusion: This dataset enables comprehensive safety evaluation of autonomous vehicles and continues to expand weekly, providing sustainable foundation for AV behavior analysis and safety research.

Abstract: Most existing autonomous-driving datasets (e.g., KITTI, nuScenes, and the Waymo Perception Dataset), collected by human-driving mode or unidentified driving mode, can only serve as early training for the perception and prediction of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To evaluate the real behavioral safety of AVs controlled in the black box, we present the first end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely by autonomous-driving mode in the real world. This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames. The dataset continues to expand by over 10 hours of new data weekly, thereby providing a sustainable foundation for research on AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise event spotting is challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Existing methods rely on large labeled datasets and struggle in few-shot conditions, but obtaining large labeled datasets is practically difficult.

Method: UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph, features efficient spatio-temporal extraction using GCN and multi-scale temporal shift, and employs multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations.

Result: The approach achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: UMEG-Net provides a scalable and effective solution for few-shot precise event spotting, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data in sports analytics.

Abstract: Precise event spotting (PES) aims to recognize fine-grained events at exact moments and has become a key component of sports analytics. This task is particularly challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Consequently, most existing methods rely on domain-specific, end-to-end training with large labeled datasets and often struggle in few-shot conditions due to their dependence on pixel- or pose-based inputs alone. However, obtaining large labeled datasets is practically hard. We propose a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network (UMEG-Net) for few-shot PES. UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph and features an efficient spatio-temporal extraction module based on advanced GCN and multi-scale temporal shift. To further enhance performance, we employ multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations. Our approach achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings, providing a scalable and effective solution for few-shot PES.

*Pengcheng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical curriculum learning approach with fractal softmax for 3D aorta segmentation that addresses class imbalance and improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency for clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aorta segmentation overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships and struggle with severe class imbalance in vascular structures, limiting clinical practicality for minimally invasive repairs.

Method: Curriculum learning strategy with fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning, progressively learning from simple to complex components, with a two-stage inference strategy for acceleration.

Result: 11.65% Dice score improvement on validation set, 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on test set, and up to fivefold acceleration in inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time clinical applications in aorta pathology intervention.

Abstract: The aorta, the body's largest artery, is prone to pathologies such as dissection, aneurysm, and atherosclerosis, which often require timely intervention. Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications. The implementation code for this challenge entry is publicly available at: https://github.com/PengchengShi1220/AortaSeg24.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DetGain is an online data curation method for object detection that selects informative training samples based on their predicted contribution to dataset-level AP, improving accuracy and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality curated data outperforms larger unfiltered datasets, but existing online sampling strategies don't work well for object detection due to its structural complexity and domain gaps.

Method: Estimates marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level AP based on prediction quality, models global score distributions to compute teacher-student contribution gaps, and selects informative samples iteratively.

Result: Consistent accuracy improvements on COCO dataset with multiple detectors, strong robustness under low-quality data, and effective combination with knowledge distillation for further performance gains.

Conclusion: DetGain is a general, complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection that is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive.

Abstract: High-quality data has become a primary driver of progress under scale laws, with curated datasets often outperforming much larger unfiltered ones at lower cost. Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state. While effective in classification and multimodal learning, existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection because of its structural complexity and domain gaps. We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain also demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation techniques to further enhance performance, highlighting its potential as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCFormer is a transformer-based network for maritime vessel re-identification that addresses intra-identity variations and local part missing through global and local correlation modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vessel Re-ID methods adapted from pedestrian algorithms are ill-suited for maritime scenarios due to greater intra-identity variations and severe local part missing, leading to outlier samples within the same identity.

Method: Proposes Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer) with Global Correlation Module (GCM) that constructs global similarity affinity matrix across all input images, and Local Correlation Module (LCM) that mines and aligns local features using dynamic memory bank.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: MCFormer effectively suppresses adverse effects of outlier samples by modeling multi-scale correlations and integrating global and local features, achieving superior vessel re-identification performance.

Abstract: Maritime vessel re-identification (Re-ID) plays a crucial role in advancing maritime monitoring and intelligent situational awareness systems. However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: InstantViR is an amortized inference framework that distills a bidirectional video diffusion model into a causal autoregressive student for ultra-fast video reconstruction, achieving real-time performance while maintaining high quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video inverse problems need high perceptual quality with tight latency constraints for streaming, telepresence, and AR/VR applications. Current diffusion-based approaches either cause temporal artifacts or are too slow for real-time use.

Method: Distill bidirectional video diffusion teacher into causal autoregressive student using prior-driven distillation that only requires teacher model and degradation operators. Replace VAE with high-efficiency LeanVAE via teacher-space regularized distillation for low-latency processing.

Result: Achieves over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs with up to 100x speedup over iterative video diffusion solvers. Matches or surpasses diffusion-based baselines in quality for streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, making high-quality video restoration practical for modern vision systems.

Abstract: Video inverse problems are fundamental to streaming, telepresence, and AR/VR, where high perceptual quality must coexist with tight latency constraints. Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing blind face restoration methods produce deterministic results and fail to capture the multiple plausible high-quality reconstructions possible from low-quality inputs.

Method: Formulates BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task using controlled degradations of coarse restorations, enabling posterior-guided sampling in text-to-image diffusion with Forward and Reverse Measurement constraints.

Result: MCS can generate prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enables diverse face reconstructions conditioned on textual prompts while maintaining alignment with input structures.

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) may correspond to multiple plausible high-quality (HQ) reconstructions under extremely low-quality (LQ) inputs. However, existing methods typically produce deterministic results, struggling to capture this one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) approach that enables diverse LQ face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts. Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion. Measurement constraints include both Forward Measurement, which ensures results align with input structures, and Reverse Measurement, which produces projection spaces, ensuring that the solution can align with various prompts. Experiments show that our MCS can generate prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods. Codes will be released after acceptance.

TL;DR: Proposes an autoregressive diffusion model for real-time speech-driven 3D facial animation that processes audio in streaming chunks to handle variable lengths and reduce latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models process entire audio sequences at once, causing poor performance on long sequences and high latency for real-time applications.

Method: Uses an autoregressive diffusion model with limited past frames as historical context combined with audio input to iteratively generate facial motion frames in streaming fashion.

Result: Achieves flexibility with varying audio lengths, low latency independent of duration, and high-quality real-time facial animation synthesis.

Conclusion: The proposed streaming approach enables efficient real-time 3D facial animation with improved handling of long audio sequences and reduced latency.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of speech-driven 3D facial animation, which aims to generate realistic and synchronized facial motions driven by speech inputs.Recent methods have employed audio-conditioned diffusion models for 3D facial animation, achieving impressive results in generating expressive and natural animations.However, these methods process the whole audio sequences in a single pass, which poses two major challenges: they tend to perform poorly when handling audio sequences that exceed the training horizon and will suffer from significant latency when processing long audio inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results. Additionally, we implemented a real-time interactive demo, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. We will release the code at https://zju3dv.github.io/StreamingTalker/.

Conclusion: APS provides an effective model-agnostic framework that enhances active perceptual capabilities in human motion prediction through explicit motion property encoding and auxiliary learning objectives.

Abstract: Forecasting 3D human motion is an important embodiment of fine-grained understanding and cognition of human behavior by artificial agents. Current approaches excessively rely on implicit network modeling of spatiotemporal relationships and motion characteristics, falling into the passive learning trap that results in redundant and monotonous 3D coordinate information acquisition while lacking actively guided explicit learning mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose an Active Perceptual Strategy (APS) for human motion prediction, leveraging quotient space representations to explicitly encode motion properties while introducing auxiliary learning objectives to strengthen spatio-temporal modeling. Specifically, we first design a data perception module that projects poses into the quotient space, decoupling motion geometry from coordinate redundancy. By jointly encoding tangent vectors and Grassmann projections, this module simultaneously achieves geometric dimension reduction, semantic decoupling, and dynamic constraint enforcement for effective motion pose characterization. Furthermore, we introduce a network perception module that actively learns spatio-temporal dependencies through restorative learning. This module deliberately masks specific joints or injects noise to construct auxiliary supervision signals. A dedicated auxiliary learning network is designed to actively adapt and learn from perturbed information. Notably, APS is model agnostic and can be integrated with different prediction models to enhance active perceptual. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods by large margins: 16.3% on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW.

*Yan Huang,Yongyi Su,Xin Lin,Le Zhang,Xun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeSTAR is a parameter-efficient framework that enhances foundation models for monocular depth estimation through weakly supervised self-training with regularization, improving robustness in unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance of foundation models in monocular depth estimation when some downstream task data is available, addressing the need for better generalization in diverse and unseen domains.

Method: Uses dense self-training with semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, weak supervision via pairwise ordinal depth annotations, and weight regularization to anchor LoRA updates.

Result: Extensive experiments show WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks in both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: WeSTAR effectively enhances the robustness of MDE foundation models through parameter-efficient adaptation, demonstrating superior performance in challenging and diverse domains.

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models has substantially advanced zero-shot generalization in monocular depth estimation (MDE), as exemplified by the Depth Anything series. However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.

Motivation: Traditional GNSS-based localization fails in GNSS-denied environments, making feature alignment difficult for multi-agent collaborative perception.

Method: Proposes Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) for pose estimation and Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT) for confidence-aware spatial alignment with temporal context. Also introduces V2VLoc simulation dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on V2VLoc dataset under GNSS-denied conditions and shows effectiveness on real-world V2V4Real dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides robust collaborative perception in GNSS-denied environments through LiDAR-based localization and confidence-aware alignment.

Abstract: Multi-agents rely on accurate poses to share and align observations, enabling a collaborative perception of the environment. However, traditional GNSS-based localization often fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult in collaboration. To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust GNSS-free collaborative perception framework based on LiDAR localization. Specifically, we propose a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) to estimate compact pose and confidence representations. To alleviate the effects of localization errors, we further develop the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), which performs confidence-aware spatial alignment while capturing essential temporal context. Additionally, we present a new simulation dataset, V2VLoc, which can be adapted for both LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks. V2VLoc comprises three subsets: Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet. Town1Loc and Town4Loc offer multi-traversal sequences for training in localization tasks, whereas V2VDet is specifically intended for the collaborative detection task. Extensive experiments conducted on the V2VLoc dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance under GNSS-denied conditions. We further conduct extended experiments on the real-world V2V4Real dataset to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PASTAT.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, powerful image editing methods now enable diverse and highly realistic image manipulations that far surpass traditional deepfake techniques, posing new challenges for manipulation detection. Existing image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) benchmarks suffer from limited content diversity, narrow generative-model coverage, and insufficient interpretability, which hinders the generalization and explanation capabilities of current manipulation detection methods. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{ManipBench}, a large-scale benchmark for image manipulation detection and localization focusing on AI-edited images. ManipBench contains over 450K manipulated images produced by 25 state-of-the-art image editing models across 12 manipulation categories, among which 100K images are further annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations to support interpretable detection. Building upon ManipBench, we propose \textbf{ManipShield}, an all-in-one model based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that leverages contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders to achieve unified image manipulation detection, localization, and explanation. Extensive experiments on ManipBench and several public datasets demonstrate that ManipShield achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generality to unseen manipulation models.

TL;DR: Proposes GSLR framework using 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting to improve tensor-SVD representation of multi-dimensional images, addressing limitations in capturing local high-frequency information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current t-SVD methods have two key limitations: coarse approximation of latent tensor that fails to capture spatial local high-frequency information, and fixed basis atoms in transform matrix that cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along mode-3 fibers.

Method: Developed Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework using tailored 2D Gaussian splatting for latent tensor generation and 1D Gaussian splatting for transform matrix generation, creating a continuous representation.

Result: Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image recovery show GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.

Conclusion: GSLR provides a compact and continuous representation for multi-dimensional images with powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information, making it superior to existing t-SVD approaches.

Abstract: Tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) is a promising tool for multi-dimensional image representation, which decomposes a multi-dimensional image into a latent tensor and an accompanying transform matrix. However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image recovery demonstrate that GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-3D models struggle with coarse semantic alignment and lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and failures in part assembly and spatial relationships.

Method: Proposes a dual-query critic signal derived from VLM's Yes/No log-odds that assesses semantic fidelity and geometric coherence, applicable as reward objective for optimization-based pipelines and test-time guidance for feed-forward pipelines.

Result: VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks for optimization-based pipelines and actively corrects severe spatial errors in feed-forward pipelines.

Conclusion: VLM3D establishes a principled and generalizable path to inject VLM's language-grounded understanding of semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation has advanced rapidly, yet state-of-the-art models, encompassing both optimization-based and feed-forward architectures, still face two fundamental limitations. First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors. VLM3D establishes a principled and generalizable path to inject the VLM's rich, language-grounded understanding of both semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Intermediate Domain Proxies (IDP) constructed from source features as codebooks to reconstruct target domain features, enabling fast domain alignment for cross-domain few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) including semantic disjoint, large domain discrepancy, and data scarcity by leveraging intermediate domain representations rather than just generalized representations.

Method: Construct IDP with source feature embeddings as codebook, reconstruct target domain features using this codebook, and develop fast domain alignment using proxies as learning guidance for target feature transformation.

Result: The proposed model surpasses state-of-the-art models by a margin on 8 cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Collaborative learning of intermediate domain reconstruction and target feature transformation effectively addresses CDFSL challenges and achieves superior performance.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) endeavors to transfer generalized knowledge from the source domain to target domains using only a minimal amount of training data, which faces a triplet of learning challenges in the meantime, i.e., semantic disjoint, large domain discrepancy, and data scarcity. Different from predominant CDFSL works focused on generalized representations, we make novel attempts to construct Intermediate Domain Proxies (IDP) with source feature embeddings as the codebook and reconstruct the target domain feature with this learned codebook. We then conduct an empirical study to explore the intrinsic attributes from perspectives of visual styles and semantic contents in intermediate domain proxies. Reaping benefits from these attributes of intermediate domains, we develop a fast domain alignment method to use these proxies as learning guidance for target domain feature transformation. With the collaborative learning of intermediate domain reconstruction and target feature transformation, our proposed model is able to surpass the state-of-the-art models by a margin on 8 cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ShapeNet and Matterport datasets, demonstrating superior surface reconstruction accuracy and generalizability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: NeuralSSD effectively reconstructs accurate 3D surfaces from point clouds by ensuring tight data fitting through novel energy formulation and 3D convolutional learning, outperforming current approaches.

Abstract: We proposed a generalized method, NeuralSSD, for reconstructing a 3D implicit surface from the widely-available point cloud data. NeuralSSD is a solver-based on the neural Galerkin method, aimed at reconstructing higher-quality and accurate surfaces from input point clouds. Implicit method is preferred due to its ability to accurately represent shapes and its robustness in handling topological changes. However, existing parameterizations of implicit fields lack explicit mechanisms to ensure a tight fit between the surface and input data. To address this, we propose a novel energy equation that balances the reliability of point cloud information. Additionally, we introduce a new convolutional network that learns three-dimensional information to achieve superior optimization results. This approach ensures that the reconstructed surface closely adheres to the raw input points and infers valuable inductive biases from point clouds, resulting in a highly accurate and stable surface reconstruction. NeuralSSD is evaluated on a variety of challenging datasets, including the ShapeNet and Matterport datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both surface reconstruction accuracy and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in cross-modal registration between preoperative and intraoperative data in orthopedic surgery due to modality heterogeneity, aiming for robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration.

Method: Two-module framework: implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) learns preoperative bone model, and MLP-based registration module performs global initialization and local refinement using transformation hypotheses to align intraoperative point clouds.

Result: Achieves mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88°/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79°/2.45 mm on SpineDepth, matching or surpassing existing methods across all datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates strong generalizability across anatomies and modalities, providing robust and accurate cross-modal alignment for computer-assisted orthopedic surgery without requiring inter-subject training data.

Abstract: In computer- and robot-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS), patient-specific surgical plans derived from preoperative imaging define target locations and implant trajectories. During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88°/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79°/2.45 mm on SpineDepth. These results demonstrate strong generalizability across anatomies and modalities, providing robust and accurate cross-modal alignment for CAOS.

Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces data privacy and annotation cost challenges. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) struggles with unreliable pseudo-labels from weak local models and computational constraints on client devices.

Method: SAM-Fed leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients through dual knowledge distillation and an adaptive agreement mechanism for pixel-level supervision refinement.

Result: Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation in homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.

Conclusion: SAM-Fed effectively addresses FSSL challenges by using foundation models to improve pseudo-label quality while accommodating computational constraints on client devices.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is clinically important, yet data privacy and the cost of expert annotation limit the availability of labeled data. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. SAM-Fed combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision. Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show that SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-source stationary CT enables rapid reconstruction but suffers from quality degradation under ultra-sparse-view sampling, where traditional methods fail due to inaccurate interpolation.

Method: Combines Neural Attenuation Field representation with dual-branch conditional diffusion model, using iterative refinement with Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis and Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module.

Result: Achieves best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data, progressively enhancing projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: Diff-NAF effectively addresses ultra-sparse-view CT reconstruction challenges through iterative refinement, yielding high-quality reconstructions where traditional methods fail.

Abstract: Multi-source stationary computed tomography (CT) has recently attracted attention for its ability to achieve rapid image reconstruction, making it suitable for time-sensitive clinical and industrial applications. However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions.

TL;DR: Dental3R is a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust 3D dental reconstruction from sparse intraoral photos, addressing challenges of large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces in tele-orthodontics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional intraoral scanning methods are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which relies on sparse smartphone imagery. Existing 3DGS methods struggle with the clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photos due to large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces.

Method: Proposes Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to select high-value image pairs for stable geometry initialization, then trains 3DGS with wavelet-regularized objective using discrete wavelet transform to preserve fine details while suppressing artifacts.

Result: Validated on 950 clinical cases and 195 video-based test cases, Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Dental3R enables robust, high-fidelity 3D dental reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs, making digital orthodontics more accessible for remote tele-orthodontics applications.

Abstract: Intraoral 3D reconstruction is fundamental to digital orthodontics, yet conventional methods like intraoral scanning are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which typically relies on sparse smartphone imagery. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: With the rise in sedentary behavior, health problems caused by poor sitting posture have drawn increasing attention. Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing. The smallest trained model, LSP-YOLO-n, achieved 94.2% accuracy and 251 Fps on personal computer(PC) with a model size of only 1.9 MB. Meanwhile, real-time and high-accuracy inference under constrained computational resources was demonstrated on the SV830C + GC030A platform.

TL;DR: StepsNet addresses scaling limitations in deep neural networks by separating features along channels and progressively increasing width, outperforming residual models across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep residual networks struggle to realize their theoretical capacity improvements due to shortcut degradation and limited width constraints, calling for more advanced designs.

Method: Proposes StepsNet - a generalized residual architecture that separates features along the channel dimension and stacks blocks with progressively increasing width to mitigate shortcut degradation and width limitations.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent performance improvements over residual models in image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling tasks.

Conclusion: StepsNet serves as a superior generalization of residual architecture, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models.

Abstract: Scaling up network depth is a fundamental pursuit in neural architecture design, as theory suggests that deeper models offer exponentially greater capability. Benefiting from the residual connections, modern neural networks can scale up to more than one hundred layers and enjoy wide success. However, as networks continue to deepen, current architectures often struggle to realize their theoretical capacity improvements, calling for more advanced designs to further unleash the potential of deeper networks. In this paper, we identify two key barriers that obstruct residual models from scaling deeper: shortcut degradation and limited width. Shortcut degradation hinders deep-layer learning, while the inherent depth-width trade-off imposes limited width. To mitigate these issues, we propose a generalized residual architecture dubbed Step by Step Network (StepsNet) to bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models. Specifically, we separate features along the channel dimension and let the model learn progressively via stacking blocks with increasing width. The resulting method mitigates the two identified problems and serves as a versatile macro design applicable to various models. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms residual models across diverse tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling. These results position StepsNet as a superior generalization of the widely adopted residual architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchMap is a training-free framework that combines geometric normalization with ontology-guided reasoning for robust structured dental analysis from 3D intraoral scans, addressing limitations of supervised deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep-learning methods for intraoral 3D scan analysis require modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, limiting generalization and clinical deployment. Raw meshes also have substantial pose variation, incomplete geometry, and lack texture cues.

Method: ArchMap introduces geometry-aware arch-flattening to standardize 3D meshes into aligned multi-view projections, and constructs a Dental Knowledge Base encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain symbolic reasoning.

Result: Validated on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, ArchMap achieves robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and identifying clinical conditions like crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries, outperforming supervised pipelines and VLM baselines.

Conclusion: ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning provides a practical, scalable solution for structured 3D intraoral scan analysis in digital orthodontics, with higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under challenging conditions.

Abstract: A structured understanding of intraoral 3D scans is essential for digital orthodontics. However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. Compared with supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines, ArchMap achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under sparse or artifact-prone conditions. As a fully training-free system, ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning offers a practical and scalable solution for the structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in modern digital orthodontics.

TL;DR: DentalSCR is a contour-guided framework for reliable 3D-2D alignment between intraoral scans and lateral cephalometric radiographs, addressing challenges like projective magnification and low-contrast dental crowns that hinder conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle with clinical cephalograms due to projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation, leading to convergence failures and anatomically implausible alignments.

Method: Proposes DentalSCR framework with: 1) U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) for unified anatomical coordinate system, 2) radiograph-like projections using surface-based DRR with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, 3) 2D similarity transform optimized with symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule.

Result: Evaluation on 34 clinical cases shows substantial reductions in landmark error (especially at posterior teeth), tighter dispersion on lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at curve level, outperforming conventional baselines.

Conclusion: DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D-2D alignment, providing a reliable solution for orthodontic diagnosis.

Abstract: Reliable 3D-2D alignment between intraoral scan (IOS) models and lateral cephalometric radiographs is critical for orthodontic diagnosis, yet conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle under real clinical conditions, where cephalograms exhibit projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation. These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines.

Abstract: The proliferation of hour-long videos (e.g., lectures, podcasts, documentaries) has intensified demand for efficient content structuring. However, existing approaches are constrained by small-scale training with annotations that are typical short and coarse, restricting generalization to nuanced transitions in long videos. We introduce ARC-Chapter, the first large-scale video chaptering model trained on over million-level long video chapters, featuring bilingual, temporally grounded, and hierarchical chapter annotations. To achieve this goal, we curated a bilingual English-Chinese chapter dataset via a structured pipeline that unifies ASR transcripts, scene texts, visual captions into multi-level annotations, from short title to long summaries. We demonstrate clear performance improvements with data scaling, both in data volume and label intensity. Moreover, we design a new evaluation metric termed GRACE, which incorporates many-to-one segment overlaps and semantic similarity, better reflecting real-world chaptering flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARC-Chapter establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin, outperforming the previous best by 14.0% in F1 score and 11.3% in SODA score. Moreover, ARC-Chapter shows excellent transferability, improving the state-of-the-art on downstream tasks like dense video captioning on YouCook2.

TL;DR: Image-Based Gaussian Splatting improves 3DGS by using source images for fine details and view-dependent effects without increasing storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with spatially varying colors and view-dependent effects due to limited spherical harmonics, and existing solutions have storage or complexity issues.

Method: Combine standard 3DGS base color with learned residuals from neighboring training images to capture high-frequency details and view-dependent effects.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting approaches in rendering quality on standard benchmarks while maintaining the same storage footprint.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables high-quality rendering of complex details and view-dependent effects in 3DGS without additional storage costs.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a fast, high-quality method for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects. Experiments on standard NVS benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting approaches in rendering quality, without increasing the storage footprint.

Bapp's performance was evaluated using standard metrics, including Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, with results demonstrating 98.4% precision, 96.9% recall, and an overall accuracy of 98.3%. These outcomes confirm the reliability of Bapp as a portable, accessible, and objective tool for monitoring both normal and abnormal eyelid movements. The application offers a promising alternative to traditional manual blink counting, supporting continuous ocular health monitoring and postoperative evaluation in clinical environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs struggle to interpret abstract visual inputs like hand-drawn sketches, which offer intuitive means of expressing concepts difficult to describe textually.

Evaluations incorporate three existing sketch datasets (QuickDraw!, Sketchy, Tu Berlin) and their generated SketchVCL dataset.

Result: O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple sketch-based tasks including object localization, counting, image retrieval (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and visual question answering (VQA), substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the sketch comprehension limitations of LVLMs through a comprehensive dataset and model design, demonstrating superior performance across various sketch-based reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, their ability to interpret abstract visual inputs remains limited. Specifically, they struggle to comprehend hand-drawn sketches, a modality that offers an intuitive means of expressing concepts that are difficult to describe textually. We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.

TL;DR: JFD3 is an end-to-end framework that jointly performs deblurring and detection for infrared UAV images using a dual-branch architecture with shared weights, where clear branch guides blurred branch to enhance discriminative features for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared UAV target images suffer from motion blur that reduces target-background contrast, and existing methods treat deblurring as preprocessing focused on visual quality rather than enhancing task-relevant features for detection.

Method: Dual-branch architecture with shared weights: 1) lightweight feature restoration network using clear branch as supervision, 2) frequency structure guidance module to refine structure prior, 3) feature consistency self-supervised loss between branches.

Result: Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV benchmark (30K simulated + 4K real images) show superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.

Conclusion: JFD3 effectively enhances discriminative feature representation for detection under blur conditions through joint feature-domain deblurring and detection framework.

Abstract: Infrared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target images often suffer from motion blur degradation caused by rapid sensor movement, significantly reducing contrast between target and background. Generally, detection performance heavily depends on the discriminative feature representation between target and background. Existing methods typically treat deblurring as a preprocessing step focused on visual quality, while neglecting the enhancement of task-relevant features crucial for detection. Improving feature representation for detection under blur conditions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Feature-Domain Deblurring and Detection end-to-end framework, dubbed JFD3. We design a dual-branch architecture with shared weights, where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight feature restoration network, where features from the clear branch serve as feature-level supervision to guide the blurred branch, thereby enhancing its distinctive capability for detection. We then propose a frequency structure guidance module that refines the structure prior from the restoration network and integrates it into shallow detection layers to enrich target structural information. Finally, a feature consistency self-supervised loss is imposed between the dual-branch detection backbones, driving the blurred branch to approximate the feature representations of the clear one. Wealso construct a benchmark, named IRBlurUAV, containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images with diverse motion blur. Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV demonstrate that JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in automated quantitative methods for evaluating shoulder presentation compliance in biometric identity documents, as mandated by international standards.

Method: Quantifies shoulder yaw and roll angles using only 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks from common pose estimation frameworks.

Result: SPE scores showed strong correlation (r ≈ 0.80) with human labels on 121 portrait images, with effective filtering performance for non-compliant samples.

Conclusion: The SPE algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrollment systems for biometric identity documents.

Abstract: International standards for biometric identity documents mandate strict compliance with pose requirements, including the square presentation of a subject's shoulders. However, the literature on automated quality assessment offers few quantitative methods for evaluating this specific attribute. This paper proposes a Shoulder Presentation Evaluation (SPE) algorithm to address this gap. The method quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using only the 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks provided by common pose estimation frameworks. The algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 121 portrait images. The resulting SPE scores demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation (r approx. 0.80) with human-assigned labels. An analysis of the metric's filtering performance, using an adapted Error-versus-Discard methodology, confirmed its utility in identifying non-compliant samples. The proposed algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrolment systems.

TL;DR: First texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models using 3D PAEs with global camouflage texture for visual consistency across stereo viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attacks use 2D patches targeting monocular perception, leaving stereo-based binocular depth estimation vulnerable and unexplored for physical adversarial examples.

Method: Proposes 3D PAE with global camouflage texture, 3D stereo matching rendering module for real-world alignment, and novel merging attack for seamless background integration through fine-grained optimization.

Result: Extensive evaluations show PAEs successfully fool stereo models into producing erroneous depth information with enhanced stealth and lethality.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates effective physical adversarial attacks on stereo vision systems, highlighting vulnerabilities in autonomous driving perception that require improved defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Though deep neural models adopted to realize the perception of autonomous driving have proven vulnerable to adversarial examples, known attacks often leverage 2D patches and target mostly monocular perception. Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information.

Conclusion: TLS-Assist effectively enhances LLM-based autonomous driving agents by providing explicit traffic rule enforcement and improving detection of safety-critical objects, leading to better overall driving performance and safety.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making and planning in autonomous driving, showing promising reasoning capabilities and potential to generalize across diverse traffic situations. However, current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and often struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights and signs. To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups. We evaluate TLS-Assist in a closed-loop setup on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA. The results demonstrate relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions. We publicly release the code and models on https://github.com/iis-esslingen/TLS-Assist.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement for inferring 3D human motion in world coordinates, which is challenging when both human and camera motion are present.

Method: Created BEDLAM2.0 dataset with more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, increased diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments, and added shoes that were missing in the original BEDLAM dataset.

Result: BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates, as shown by comparing state-of-the-art methods trained on both datasets.

Conclusion: BEDLAM2.0 provides a superior dataset for 3D human pose and motion estimation, particularly for world coordinate estimation, and is made available for research purposes with rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, camera motions, and 3D assets.

Abstract: Inferring 3D human motion from video remains a challenging problem with many applications. While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM. For research purposes, we provide the rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, and camera motions. We also provide the 3D assets to which we have rights and links to those from third parties.

Motivation: Current VLMs process videos in single-pass manner with limited evidence revisit, while agent-based methods depend on expensive proprietary models or extensive RL training.

Method: Three-phase reasoning (Retrieve-Perceive-Review), structured video knowledge base with entity graphs, multi-granularity tools, and open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with CV models and VLM.

Result: Competitive performance on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA datasets with superior interpretability.

Conclusion: AVI provides a flexible, training-free framework for complex video reasoning that mirrors human comprehension without dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training.

Abstract: Video understanding requires not only visual recognition but also complex reasoning. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they typically process videos largely in a single-pass manner with limited support for evidence revisit and iterative refinement. While recently emerging agent-based methods enable long-horizon reasoning, they either depend heavily on expensive proprietary models or require extensive agentic RL training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training. Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA demonstrate that AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability.

Motivation: Existing DIL methods face a dilemma: unified visual spaces cause inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, while isolated parameters create knowledge islands that hamper knowledge reuse and cause forgetting.

Method: LAVA replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by text-based reference anchors. It preserves consistent relative geometry by mirroring pairwise semantic similarities between class names, creating a bridge across domains.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks show LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LAVA effectively addresses the DIL dilemma by using language-anchored visual alignment to enable knowledge retrieval and robust feature aggregation across domains.

Abstract: A key challenge in Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is to continually learn under shifting distributions while preserving knowledge from previous domains. Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating "knowledge islands" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/ShuyiGeng/LAVA.

*Ravi Shankar Prasad,Nandani Sharma,Dinesh Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cranio-ID: A novel framework for automatic craniometric landmark annotation and cross-modal matching between skull X-rays and optical face images using YOLO-pose models, graph representations, cross-attention, and optimal transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional craniometric landmark localization methods are time-consuming and require expertise, while current automatic methods lack reliability due to insufficient validation studies.

Method: 1) Automatic landmark annotation on 2D skull X-rays using trained YOLO-pose models; 2) Cross-modal matching by converting landmarks into graph representations and finding semantic correspondence using cross-attention and optimal transport framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on S2F and CUHK datasets demonstrate significant improvements in reliability and accuracy for cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic science.

Conclusion: The proposed Cranio-ID framework provides an effective and reliable solution for forensic craniofacial identification, outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: In forensic craniofacial identification and in many biomedical applications, craniometric landmarks are important. Traditional methods for locating landmarks are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and expertise. Current methods utilize superimposition and deep learning-based methods that employ automatic annotation of landmarks. However, these methods are not reliable due to insufficient large-scale validation studies. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework Cranio-ID: First, an automatic annotation of landmarks on 2D skulls (which are X-ray scans of faces) with their respective optical images using our trained YOLO-pose models. Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, which demonstrates significant improvements in both reliability and accuracy, as well as its effectiveness in cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic science.

TL;DR: CATDiet simulates infant vision development (grayscale-to-color, blur-to-sharp, temporal continuity) in self-supervised learning, enhancing model robustness and producing biologically aligned behaviors. CombDiet further improves performance by initializing with CATDiet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the ecological advantages of staged "visual diets" similar to infant visual development and understand how such developmental progression can enhance machine visual intelligence.

Method: Train SSL models on object-centric videos under CATDiet constraints (grayscale-to-color, blur-to-sharp, temporal continuity), then develop CombDiet which initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training.

Result: CATDiet variants show enhanced robustness in object recognition across 10 datasets and exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns. CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception.

Conclusion: Early infant visual experience progression provides a powerful reverse-engineering framework for developing robust visual intelligence in machines.

Abstract: Newborns perceive the world with low-acuity, color-degraded, and temporally continuous vision, which gradually sharpens as infants develop. To explore the ecological advantages of such staged "visual diets", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines. All code, data, and models will be publicly released.

Motivation: Low-light video deblurring is challenging due to dim lighting and long exposures in applications like nighttime surveillance and autonomous driving. Existing fusion methods using staged strategies are limited against combined low-light and motion blur degradations.

Method: Proposes CompEvent with two core components: 1) Complex Temporal Alignment GRU using complex-valued convolutions and GRU for temporal alignment and continuous fusion of video and event streams; 2) Complex Space-Frequency Learning module performing unified complex-valued signal processing in spatial and frequency domains for deep fusion.

Conclusion: By leveraging holistic representation capability of complex-valued neural networks, CompEvent achieves full-process spatiotemporal fusion, maximizes complementary learning between modalities, and significantly strengthens low-light video deblurring capability.

Abstract: Low-light video deblurring poses significant challenges in applications like nighttime surveillance and autonomous driving due to dim lighting and long exposures. While event cameras offer potential solutions with superior low-light sensitivity and high temporal resolution, existing fusion methods typically employ staged strategies, limiting their effectiveness against combined low-light and motion blur degradations. To overcome this, we propose CompEvent, a complex neural network framework enabling holistic full-process fusion of event data and RGB frames for enhanced joint restoration. CompEvent features two core components: 1) Complex Temporal Alignment GRU, which utilizes complex-valued convolutions and processes video and event streams iteratively via GRU to achieve temporal alignment and continuous fusion; and 2) Complex Space-Frequency Learning module, which performs unified complex-valued signal processing in both spatial and frequency domains, facilitating deep fusion through spatial structures and system-level characteristics. By leveraging the holistic representation capability of complex-valued neural networks, CompEvent achieves full-process spatiotemporal fusion, maximizes complementary learning between modalities, and significantly strengthens low-light video deblurring capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompEvent outperforms SOTA methods in addressing this challenging task. The code is available at https://github.com/YuXie1/CompEvent.

*Julia Machnio,Mads Nielsen,Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning framework for white matter hyperintensity segmentation and regional localization, showing regional WMH volumes outperform global lesion burden for AD classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most automated WMH methods only provide global lesion load and overlook spatial distribution across white matter regions, missing important diagnostic information.

Method: Deep learning framework for WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and ADNI cohort, with regional WMH quantification and integration with brain structure volumes.

Result: Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification (AUC up to 0.97), with anterior white matter tracts showing reproducible association with AD diagnostic status.

Conclusion: Regional WMH quantification provides added value over global measures, and combining localized lesion metrics with atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers in cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related dementias. Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.

*Bayu Adhi Tama,Jianwu Wang,Vandana Janeja,Mostafa Cham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A physics-guided deep learning framework that predicts subglacial bed topography by learning residuals over a prior model, using multiple physical constraints and achieving better generalization than standard architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar observations for subglacial bed topography are sparse and uneven, making accurate ice sheet modeling challenging. Existing methods lack physical consistency and struggle with domain generalization.

Method: DeepLabV3+ decoder with ResNet-50 encoder trained with physics constraints: multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity, prior-consistency, and masked Huber fit to radar data with confidence weighting. Uses leakage-safe blockwise hold-out validation.

Result: Outperforms U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and plain CNN across two Greenland regions. Achieves strong test accuracy and high structural fidelity with spatially coherent, physically plausible bed reconstructions.

Conclusion: The residual-over-prior design combined with physics constraints enables accurate, physically consistent subglacial bed mapping that generalizes well under domain shift, suitable for operational applications.

Abstract: Accurate subglacial bed topography is essential for ice sheet modeling, yet radar observations are sparse and uneven. We propose a physics-guided residual learning framework that predicts bed thickness residuals over a BedMachine prior and reconstructs bed from the observed surface. A DeepLabV3+ decoder over a standard encoder (e.g.,ResNet-50) is trained with lightweight physics and data terms: multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity of thickness, a ramped prior-consistency term, and a masked Huber fit to radar picks modulated by a confidence map. To measure real-world generalization, we adopt leakage-safe blockwise hold-outs (vertical/horizontal) with safety buffers and report metrics only on held-out cores. Across two Greenland sub-regions, our approach achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and a plain CNN. The residual-over-prior design, combined with physics, yields spatially coherent, physically plausible beds suitable for operational mapping under domain shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of missing MRI modalities in clinical settings, which severely compromises deep learning segmentation model performance and generalizability.

Method: Shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture with hierarchical modality self-distillation and progressive modality combination distillation that simulates gradual modality dropout during training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks with strong generalization and stability.

Conclusion: CCSD framework effectively handles arbitrary modality combinations and demonstrates robust performance in real-world clinical scenarios with incomplete MRI data.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modal MRI is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency in computer vision tasks by avoiding the computational burden of iterative transport plan computation in conventional optimal transport methods.

Method: Proposes Gaussian splatting-based method to estimate pixel-annotation correspondence, computes transport plan using Bayesian probability, and derives a loss function for network optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on crowd counting and landmark detection validate effectiveness, with significant efficiency improvements over conventional optimal transport schemes.

Conclusion: GST provides an efficient framework for spatial transport in computer vision tasks by eliminating iterative computations while maintaining performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces Gaussian Spatial Transport (GST), a novel framework that leverages Gaussian splatting to facilitate transport from the probability measure in the image coordinate space to the annotation map. We propose a Gaussian splatting-based method to estimate pixel-annotation correspondence, which is then used to compute a transport plan derived from Bayesian probability. To integrate the resulting transport plan into standard network optimization in typical computer vision tasks, we derive a loss function that measures discrepancy after transport. Extensive experiments on representative computer vision tasks, including crowd counting and landmark detection, validate the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to conventional optimal transport schemes, GST eliminates iterative transport plan computation during training, significantly improving efficiency.

*Nathaniel Putera,Daniel Vilet Rodríguez,Noah Videcrantz,Julia Machnio,Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer-based MRI embeddings are better at identifying cognitively stable individuals, while clinical/volumetric features excel at predicting severe progression in Alzheimer's disease.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular predictors have limited ability to capture subtle brain changes in Alzheimer's disease progression, while imaging data may provide complementary information for more accurate modeling.

Method: Used Dynamic Time Warping clustering for trajectory-aware labeling, trained 3D Vision Transformer via unsupervised reconstruction on MRI data, and compared transformer embeddings against tabular features and CNN baselines using various classifiers.

Result: Clinical/volumetric features achieved ~0.70 AUC for predicting mild/severe progression, while ViT MRI embeddings achieved 0.71 AUC for distinguishing stable individuals. All methods struggled with moderate progression group.

Conclusion: Clinical features are best for identifying high-risk extremes, transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to stability markers, suggesting multimodal fusion strategies for Alzheimer's progression modeling.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is essential for early stratification and personalized management. While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.

TL;DR: SEED-SR is a novel approach that performs super-resolution in segmentation-aware latent space rather than pixel space, enabling unprecedented 20x scale factor for farm boundary delineation from satellite imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reference-based super-resolution methods fail for smallholder farm delineation due to optimizing perceptual quality over task-critical features, inability to handle large scale factors, and ineffective utilization of diverse satellite sources.

Method: Combines conditional latent diffusion models with large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models to bypass explicit pixel-space super-resolution and perform SR in segmentation-aware latent space.

Result: Achieves 20x scale factor and demonstrates 25.5% and 12.9% relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods on two large real datasets.

Conclusion: SEED-SR's segmentation-aware latent space approach enables unprecedented scale factors and significant performance improvements for farm boundary delineation, effectively combining high-resolution reference images with low-resolution frequent imagery.

Abstract: Delineating farm boundaries through segmentation of satellite images is a fundamental step in many agricultural applications. The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\textbf{25.5}$ and $\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods.

TL;DR: RSD is a framework that uses Vision-Language Models to enhance End-to-End autonomous driving systems by distilling risk attention into BEV features, improving generalization in complex driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems struggle with generalization to unseen scenarios and sensor configurations. Existing VLM approaches create hybrid systems with potential inconsistencies, while VLA frameworks have prohibitive computational demands.

Method: Introduces Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD) with RiskHead module that distills causal risk estimates from VLMs into Bird's-Eye-View features, creating interpretable risk-attention maps to enhance BEV representations.

Result: Experiments on Bench2Drive benchmark show significant improvements in both perception and planning capabilities, with enhanced ability to handle complex and unpredictable driving conditions.

Conclusion: RSD effectively addresses generalization challenges in autonomous driving by leveraging VLMs to provide richer risk attention representations, aligning with human-like driving behavior and improving performance in dynamic environments.

Abstract: The autonomous driving (AD) system has exhibited remarkable performance in complex driving scenarios. However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions. Due to the enhanced BEV representations enabled by RSD, we observed a significant improvement in both perception and planning capabilities.

Motivation: Existing methods use convolutions and attention for task interactions, but there's a need for better modeling of holistic task relationships in multi-task dense prediction.

Method: Leverages state space models with dual parameter experts for task-specific priors, uses S4 for global integration, and employs Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning for 2D feature sequences.

Result: Extensive experiments on NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: PAMM provides an effective framework for multi-task dense prediction by enhancing task interconnectivity through state space models and improved 2D feature processing.

Abstract: Understanding the inter-relations and interactions between tasks is crucial for multi-task dense prediction. Existing methods predominantly utilize convolutional layers and attention mechanisms to explore task-level interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel decoder-based framework, Parameter Aware Mamba Model (PAMM), specifically designed for dense prediction in multi-task learning setting. Distinct from approaches that employ Transformers to model holistic task relationships, PAMM leverages the rich, scalable parameters of state space models to enhance task interconnectivity. It features dual state space parameter experts that integrate and set task-specific parameter priors, capturing the intrinsic properties of each task. This approach not only facilitates precise multi-task interactions but also allows for the global integration of task priors through the structured state space sequence model (S4). Furthermore, we employ the Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning method to construct multi-angle feature sequences, thereby enhancing the sequence model's perceptual capabilities for 2D data. Extensive experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/CQC-gogopro/PAMM.

TL;DR: D-PerceptCT is a novel LDCT enhancement method inspired by human visual system principles, using semantic-aware feature extraction and global-local processing to preserve critical diagnostic details while reducing noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDCT reduces radiation risk but degrades image quality, and existing methods often over-smooth images, losing important diagnostic details needed by radiologists.

Method: Uses Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex) with DINOv2 semantic priors and Global-Local State-Space block for long-range information, plus Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF) based on human contrast sensitivity.

Result: Extensive experiments on Mayo2016 dataset show D-PerceptCT better preserves structural and textural information in LDCT images compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: D-PerceptCT effectively enhances LDCT images by incorporating human visual system principles and semantic awareness, providing radiologists with perceptually improved images for diagnosis.

Abstract: Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is widely used as an imaging solution to aid diagnosis and other clinical tasks. However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods.

Motivation: Traditional segmentation methods for retinal imaging focus only on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness available in Doppler holographic data, which captures dynamic blood flow behavior.

Method: Proposed approach incorporates features from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline into standard segmentation architectures (U-Nets), enabling them to exploit temporal dynamics in Doppler holograms.

Result: The method achieves artery-vein segmentation performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models, demonstrating that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock deep learning potential for Doppler holography.

Conclusion: Time-resolved preprocessing enables conventional segmentation networks to effectively leverage temporal information in Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.

Abstract: Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data.

TL;DR: Proposes using in-air natural images as reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions to create synthetic datasets for underwater image restoration, overcoming limitations of scarce high-quality paired datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for underwater image restoration are constrained by scarce high-quality paired datasets, as obtaining pristine reference labels in underwater scenes is difficult, leading to debatable reference images that limit model capabilities.

Method: Establishes a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset covering 6 representative underwater degradation types with precise ground-truth labels.

Result: Models trained on the synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance across 6 network architectures and 3 independent test sets compared to existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: Provides a reliable and scalable data-driven solution for underwater image restoration and enhancement, with the generated dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Underwater image restoration and enhancement are crucial for correcting color distortion and restoring image details, thereby establishing a fundamental basis for subsequent underwater visual tasks. However, current deep learning methodologies in this area are frequently constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets. Since it is difficult to obtain pristine reference labels in underwater scenes, existing benchmarks often rely on manually selected results from enhancement algorithms, providing debatable reference images that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision. This limits the model's capabilities in color restoration, image enhancement, and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose using in-air natural images as unambiguous reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions, thereby constructing synthetic datasets that provide authentic supervision signals for model learning. Specifically, we establish a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset that covers 6 representative underwater degradation types. The framework constructs synthetic datasets with precise ground-truth labels, which facilitate the learning of an accurate mapping from degraded underwater images to their pristine scene appearances. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across 6 representative network architectures and 3 independent test sets show that models trained on our synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance to those trained on existing benchmarks. This research provides a reliable and scalable data-driven solution for underwater image restoration and enhancement.

*Xiangchen Yin,Jiahui Yuan,Zhangchi Hu,Wenzhang Sun,Jie Chen,Xiaozhen Qiao,Hao Li,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeCo-VAE proposes a decoupled VAE approach that separates video content into keyframe, motion, and residual components with dedicated encoders to achieve compact latent representation and avoid redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video VAEs overlook frame content similarity, leading to redundant latent modeling and inefficient representation of video content.

Method: Decompose video into keyframe, motion, and residual components; use dedicated encoders for each component with shared 3D decoder; employ decoupled adaptation strategy with sequential training of frozen partial encoders.

Result: Achieves superior video reconstruction performance in both quantitative and qualitative experiments compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: DeCo-VAE's decoupled approach with component-specific encoders and shared decoder effectively captures both static and dynamic video features while maintaining spatiotemporal consistency.

Abstract: Existing video Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) generally overlook the similarity between frame contents, leading to redundant latent modeling. In this paper, we propose decoupled VAE (DeCo-VAE) to achieve compact latent representation. Instead of encoding RGB pixels directly, we decompose video content into distinct components via explicit decoupling: keyframe, motion and residual, and learn dedicated latent representation for each. To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction. We further utilize a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes partial encoders while training the others sequentially, ensuring stable training and accurate learning of both static and dynamic features. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DeCo-VAE achieves superior video reconstruction performance.

*Qiang Bai,Bojian Wu,Xi Yang,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to represent multiple signed distance functions (SDFs) in a common space that preserves high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent representations by combining generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural SDFs work well for single shapes but struggle with multiple SDFs due to limited latent space information and loss of geometry details. There's a need to analyze multiple SDFs while preserving high-fidelity geometry.

Method: Combines generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies to preserve geometry details with compact latent codes. Introduces a novel sampling strategy for training queries to improve efficiency and eliminate artifacts from other SDFs.

Result: Numerical and visual evaluations on benchmarks show advantages over latest methods in representative ability and compactness.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully represents multiple SDFs in a common space, recovering high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent representations while overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have been a vital representation to represent 3D shapes or scenes with neural networks. An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs. We report numerical and visual evaluations on widely used benchmarks to validate our designs and show advantages over the latest methods in terms of the representative ability and compactness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness against advanced Deepfakes generated by GANs and autoencoders.

Method: Three-branch architecture: RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) for global inconsistencies, texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) for blending artifacts, frequency branch (CNN + SE) for spectral noise. Uses attention-based temporal pooling and adaptive attention fusion.

Result: Achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208 on Celeb-DF (v2), outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation studies validate branch synergy.

Conclusion: Comprehensive multi-modal feature fusion provides superior resilience against subtle forgeries, with Grad-CAM confirming forensic focus on authentic detection patterns.

Abstract: Deepfakes generated by advanced GANs and autoencoders severely threaten information integrity and societal stability. Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. We introduce the ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework that synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence for video Deepfake detection. The RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) extracts global visual inconsistencies; the texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) detects fine-grained blending artifacts; the frequency branch (CNN + SE) identifies periodic spectral noise. Attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive attention fusion balances branch contributions.Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) with Focal Loss, ForensicFlow achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation validates branch synergy; Grad-CAM confirms forensic focus. This comprehensive feature fusion provides superior resilience against subtle forgeries.

TL;DR: A method for modeling hand-object interactions using dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting without object priors, featuring interaction-aware Gaussians and deformation fields with progressive optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling geometry and appearance in hand-object interaction scenes without object priors, particularly handling mutual occlusion, edge blur, and complex dynamics.

Method: Uses interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with optimizable parameters for structural clarity, incorporates hand information into object deformation fields, and employs progressive optimization with explicit regularizations for stability.

Result: Surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively models complex hand-object interactions with improved structural representation and motion handling, demonstrating superior reconstruction quality compared to previous methods.

Abstract: This paper focuses on a challenging setting of simultaneously modeling geometry and appearance of hand-object interaction scenes without any object priors. We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction.

Motivation: To provide better model interpretability for clinical adoption by showing global model behavior rather than just single-slide saliency highlights, increasing confidence in AI models for digital pathology.

Method: Clustering-based explainability technique that groups and visualizes model behavior patterns across multiple samples, applied to convolutional neural networks in digital pathology.

Result: Successfully evaluated on a prostate cancer detection model, demonstrating usefulness for understanding model operation and increasing clinical confidence.

Conclusion: The clustering-based approach provides superior explainability compared to traditional saliency methods, facilitating faster adoption of AI models in clinical pathology practice.

Abstract: We present a clustering-based explainability technique for digital pathology models based on convolutional neural networks. Unlike commonly used methods based on saliency maps, such as occlusion, GradCAM, or relevance propagation, which highlight regions that contribute the most to the prediction for a single slide, our method shows the global behaviour of the model under consideration, while also providing more fine-grained information. The result clusters can be visualised not only to understand the model, but also to increase confidence in its operation, leading to faster adoption in clinical practice. We also evaluate the performance of our technique on an existing model for detecting prostate cancer, demonstrating its usefulness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniZip is a training-free framework that compresses audio-video tokens in omnimodal LLMs using audio-guided pruning, achieving 3.42× speedup and 1.4× memory reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Processing audio-video token sequences creates computational bottlenecks in omnimodal LLMs, and existing token compression methods don't address the need for joint multimodal token compression.

Method: OmniZip identifies salient audio tokens, computes audio retention scores to guide video token pruning using cross-modal similarity, and compresses video tokens with an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme.

Result: Achieves 3.42× inference speedup and 1.4× memory reduction compared to other top-performing methods while maintaining performance without requiring training.

Conclusion: OmniZip effectively bridges the gap in multimodal token compression, providing significant computational efficiency gains for audio-video understanding in omnimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models (OmniLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention of late towards unified audio-video understanding, wherein processing audio-video token sequences creates a significant computational bottleneck, however. Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the merits of OmniZip - it achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing counterparts, while maintaining performance with no training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poor bone health and low BMD increase fracture risk in osteoporosis. Current methods may not effectively integrate multimodal data for accurate BMD prediction.

Method: Uses bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate X-ray images and clinical metadata features, with a Weighted Smooth L1 loss to handle BMD imbalance and prioritize clinically significant cases.

Result: Outperforms baseline models, reducing MSE by 16.7%, MAE by 6.03%, and increasing R2 score by 16.4% compared to naive feature concatenation. Shows good screening performance at clinically relevant BMD thresholds.

Conclusion: The cross-attention fusion and customized loss function effectively improve BMD estimation, demonstrating potential for real-world osteoporosis screening applications.

Abstract: Poor bone health is a significant public health concern, and low bone mineral density (BMD) leads to an increased fracture risk, a key feature of osteoporosis. We present XAttn-BMD (Cross-Attention BMD), a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts femoral neck BMD from hip X-ray images and structured clinical metadata. It utilizes a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate image and metadata features for cross-modal mutual reinforcement. A Weighted Smooth L1 loss is tailored to address BMD imbalance and prioritize clinically significant cases. Extensive experiments on the data from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study show that our model outperforms the baseline models in regression generalization and robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both cross-attention fusion and the customized loss function. Experimental results show that the integration of multimodal data via cross-attention outperforms naive feature concatenation without cross-attention, reducing MSE by 16.7%, MAE by 6.03%, and increasing the R2 score by 16.4%, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach for femoral neck BMD estimation. Furthermore, screening performance was evaluated using binary classification at clinically relevant femoral neck BMD thresholds, demonstrating the model's potential in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: HoloTea is a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E histology while leveraging information from adjacent sections, enabling scalable and accurate 3D tissue transcriptomics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either treat tissue sections independently (ignoring 3D structure) or are not generative/scalable, limiting holistic understanding of tissue organization in 3D.

Method: Uses flow-matching with cross-section context fusion via ControlNet, retrieves morphologically corresponding spots in shared feature space, and employs a 3D-consistent prior combining learned ZINB prior with spatial-empirical prior from neighbors.

Result: Consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions compared to 2D and 3D baselines.

Conclusion: HoloTea enables creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, advancing biomarker discovery and understanding of disease through scalable 3D tissue transcriptomics.

Abstract: A scalable and robust 3D tissue transcriptomics profile can enable a holistic understanding of tissue organization and provide deeper insights into human biology and disease. Most predictive algorithms that infer ST directly from histology treat each section independently and ignore 3D structure, while existing 3D-aware approaches are not generative and do not scale well. We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines. We envision HoloTea advancing the creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, ultimately accelerating biomarker discovery and deepening our understanding of disease.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes BioST-GCN, a dual-stream model combining pose and biomechanical data for vision-based fall prediction, achieving improved performance on simulated datasets but showing significant simulation-reality gap in real-world generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Falls are a major cause of injury in older adults, and vision-based prediction systems are limited by scarce real fall data, necessitating better models that can generalize from simulated to real scenarios.

Method: Developed Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN) with dual streams for pose and biomechanical information, using cross-attention fusion and spatio-temporal attention mechanisms for interpretability.

Result: BioST-GCN outperformed baseline ST-GCN by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on simulated datasets, achieving 89.0% F1-score with full supervision but dropping to 35.9% in zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects due to simulation-reality gap.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need to bridge the simulation-reality gap through personalization strategies and privacy-preserving data pipelines to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.

Abstract: Falls are a leading cause of injury and loss of independence among older adults. Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as `intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian Splatting methods overfit in sparse-view scenarios due to increased anisotropy in flattened Gaussians, leading to poor surface reconstruction and degraded novel view synthesis.

Method: Introduces Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment to bridge rendering quality and geometry estimation, and Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency using both training and unseen views.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets, demonstrating more accurate surface reconstruction while preserving high-quality novel view rendering.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates overfitting in sparse-view Gaussian Splatting, jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: Computational cytology faces two major challenges: unreliable and costly instance-level labels, and extremely low witness rates, making traditional supervised learning approaches impractical.

Method: Jointly optimizes weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, with Adaptive Gradient Surgery to stabilize learning. Uses attention-based Multiple Instance Learning for bag-level prediction and attention-guided instance retrieval.

Conclusion: Resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks in computational cytology, particularly at low witness rates.

Abstract: Computational cytology faces two major challenges: i) instance-level labels are unreliable and prohibitively costly to obtain, ii) witness rates are extremely low. We propose SLAM-AGS, a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that jointly optimizes (i) a weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, yielding stronger performance on downstream tasks. To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. We integrate the pretrained encoder into an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning aggregator for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval of the most abnormal instances in a bag. On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks.

Motivation: Manual airway segmentation from CT scans is impractical, and automated U-Net-based methods often produce disconnected components that hinder reliable biomarker extraction.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) nnU-Net-based network produces initial airway mask, 2) skeleton-based algorithm identifies discontinuities and proposes reconnections, 3) 1D convolutional classifier determines which candidate links correspond to true anatomical branches.

Conclusion: RepAir provides robust airway segmentation that maintains high accuracy while addressing the connectivity issues of previous methods, making it suitable for both healthy subjects and patients with severe airway pathology.

Abstract: Accurate airway segmentation from chest computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for quantitative lung analysis, yet manual annotation is impractical and many automated U-Net-based methods yield disconnected components that hinder reliable biomarker extraction. We present RepAir, a three-stage framework for robust 3D airway segmentation that combines an nnU-Net-based network with anatomically informed topology correction. The segmentation network produces an initial airway mask, after which a skeleton-based algorithm identifies potential discontinuities and proposes reconnections. A 1D convolutional classifier then determines which candidate links correspond to true anatomical branches versus false or obstructed paths. We evaluate RepAir on two distinct datasets: ATM'22, comprising annotated CT scans from predominantly healthy subjects and AeroPath, encompassing annotated scans with severe airway pathology. Across both datasets, RepAir outperforms existing 3D U-Net-based approaches such as Bronchinet and NaviAirway on both voxel-level and topological metrics, and produces more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees while maintaining high segmentation accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs/VLMs, spatial reasoning remains a significant challenge. The paper aims to test if imagination through internal spatial simulation is the key mechanism for spatial reasoning.

Method: Introduced SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark to measure spatial reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Proposed Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training to build internal world models.

Result: Three key findings: 1) VLMs rely on linguistic representations, struggling with visual-centric spatial tasks 2) Severe inefficiency with token usage growing rapidly with complexity 3) IDF framework can implicitly construct internal world models for better spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: The work delineates spatial reasoning limits of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings in current mechanisms, and provides a framework (IDF) to inform future improvements in spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), such as DeepSeek R1,OpenAI o3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across logical inference, problem solving, and decision making. However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances

Method: Proposes KANGURA framework that formulates prediction as function decomposition using KAN-based representation learning, geometry-disentangled representation learning, and unified attention mechanisms to enhance spatial understanding of 3D structures.

Result: Outperforms 15+ SOTA models on ModelNet40 with 92.7% accuracy and achieves 97% accuracy in real-world MFC anode structure optimization.

Conclusion: KANGURA establishes a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, enabling optimization of complex structures in advanced manufacturing and engineering applications.

Abstract: Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) offer a promising pathway for sustainable energy generation by converting organic matter into electricity through microbial processes. A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy. This establishes KANGURA as a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, unlocking new possibilities for optimizing complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications.

### [128] [When AI Does Science: Evaluating the Autonomous AI Scientist KOSMOS in Radiation Biology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13825)
*Humza Nusrat,Omar Nusrat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KOSMOS, an autonomous AI scientist, was tested on three radiation biology hypotheses using random-gene null benchmarks. Results showed one well-supported discovery (CDO1), one uncertain result (OGT), and one false hypothesis (DDR-p53 relationship), demonstrating AI scientists can generate useful ideas but require rigorous validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the capabilities of agentic AI "scientists" like KOSMOS in generating and testing scientific hypotheses in radiation biology, and to assess their performance against appropriate null models.

Method: Used KOSMOS to test three hypotheses in radiation biology against simple random-gene null benchmarks: 1) DDR capacity predicting p53 response, 2) OGT and CDO1 predicting radiation-response modules, 3) 12-gene signature predicting prostate cancer recurrence.

Result: Hypothesis 1 was unsupported (weak negative correlation, rho=-0.40, p=0.76). CDO1 showed strong association (r=0.70, p=0.0039), OGT weak association (r=0.23, p=0.34). 12-gene signature achieved C-index=0.61 (p=0.017) but non-unique effect size.

Conclusion: AI scientists like KOSMOS can generate useful scientific ideas but require rigorous auditing against appropriate null models, as they produced mixed results including one well-supported discovery, one uncertain finding, and one false hypothesis.

Abstract: Agentic AI "scientists" now use language models to search the literature, run analyses, and generate hypotheses. We evaluate KOSMOS, an autonomous AI scientist, on three problems in radiation biology using simple random-gene null benchmarks. Hypothesis 1: baseline DNA damage response (DDR) capacity across cell lines predicts the p53 transcriptional response after irradiation (GSE30240). Hypothesis 2: baseline expression of OGT and CDO1 predicts the strength of repressed and induced radiation-response modules in breast cancer cells (GSE59732). Hypothesis 3: a 12-gene expression signature predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival after prostate radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy (GSE116918). The DDR-p53 hypothesis was not supported: DDR score and p53 response were weakly negatively correlated (Spearman rho = -0.40, p = 0.76), indistinguishable from random five-gene scores. OGT showed only a weak association (r = 0.23, p = 0.34), whereas CDO1 was a clear outlier (r = 0.70, empirical p = 0.0039). The 12-gene signature achieved a concordance index of 0.61 (p = 0.017) but a non-unique effect size. Overall, KOSMOS produced one well-supported discovery, one plausible but uncertain result, and one false hypothesis, illustrating that AI scientists can generate useful ideas but require rigorous auditing against appropriate null models.

*Anna Rodum Bjøru,Rafael Cabañas,Helge Langseth,Antonio Salmerón*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extension of Bjøru et al.'s divide-and-conquer algorithm for bounding counterfactual probabilities from Markovian to semi-Markovian structural causal models, addressing challenges with confounding relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend counterfactual probability bounding methods to semi-Markovian SCMs, which can represent confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot capture.

Method: Investigates extension challenges using minimal examples, proposes alternative solution strategies, and evaluates them theoretically and computationally.

Result: Identifies challenges in extending the methodology to semi-Markovian models and develops alternative strategies to address them.

Conclusion: Successfully extends the counterfactual bounding approach to semi-Markovian SCMs, enabling analysis of models with confounding relationships.

Abstract: Recently, Bjøru et al. proposed a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm for bounding counterfactual probabilities in structural causal models (SCMs). They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies. These strategies are evaluated both theoretically and through a computational study.

*Badhan Chandra Das,Md Tasnim Jawad,Md Jueal Mia,M. Hadi Amini,Yanzhao Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes vulnerabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in Intelligent Transportation Systems to jailbreaking attacks using image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting, and proposes a defense mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs are widely used in ITS applications but are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, posing security risks in critical transportation systems.

Method: Constructed a transportation-specific harmful query dataset, developed a novel jailbreaking attack using image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting, and proposed a multi-layered response filtering defense technique.

Result: Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LVLMs showed successful jailbreaking attacks, with GPT-4 and manual verification confirming toxicity in generated responses. The proposed attack outperformed existing techniques.

Conclusion: The study highlights severe security risks in LVLMs integrated in ITS and demonstrates the effectiveness of both the proposed jailbreaking attack and defense mechanism.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in multimodal reasoning and many real-world applications, such as visual question answering. However, LVLMs are highly vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. This paper systematically analyzes the vulnerabilities of LVLMs integrated in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) under carefully crafted jailbreaking attacks. First, we carefully construct a dataset with harmful queries relevant to transportation, following OpenAI's prohibited categories to which the LVLMs should not respond. Second, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack that exploits the vulnerabilities of LVLMs through image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting. Third, we propose a multi-layered response filtering defense technique to prevent the model from generating inappropriate responses. We perform extensive experiments with the proposed attack and defense on the state-of-the-art LVLMs (both open-source and closed-source). To evaluate the attack method and defense technique, we use GPT-4's judgment to determine the toxicity score of the generated responses, as well as manual verification. Further, we compare our proposed jailbreaking method with existing jailbreaking techniques and highlight severe security risks involved with jailbreaking attacks with image typography manipulation and multi-turn prompting in the LVLMs integrated in ITS.

### [131] [CORGI: Efficient Pattern Matching With Quadratic Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13942)
*Daniel Weitekamp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CORGI is a new pattern-matching algorithm that provides quadratic time/space guarantees for finding matches, addressing exponential complexity issues in rule-based systems by using a two-step graph approach instead of traditional RETE β-memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule-based systems face exponential time/space issues with complex matching patterns, especially when AI systems automatically generate rules through induction or synthesis, leading to unpredictable failures and memory overflows in real-time applications.

Method: CORGI uses a two-step approach: building/maintaining a graph of grounded relations in a forward pass, then using an iterator to generate matches by working backward through the graph, eliminating traditional β-memory and full conflict sets.

Result: CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on combinatorial matching tasks, providing predictable performance without memory overflows.

Conclusion: CORGI makes rule-based systems practical for real-time applications by offering predictable quadratic performance guarantees and eliminating the memory issues of traditional RETE-based approaches.

Abstract: Rule-based systems must solve complex matching problems within tight time constraints to be effective in real-time applications, such as planning and reactive control for AI agents, as well as low-latency relational database querying. Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $β$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A scene graph-guided generative AI framework synthesizes photorealistic workplace hazard images from OSHA accident reports, with a novel VQA-based evaluation metric outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring realistic datasets of workplace hazards is difficult because capturing actual accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible.

Method: OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, converted into object-level scene graphs that guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes.

Result: The proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics across four state-of-the-art generative models based on entropy-based validation, confirming higher discriminative sensitivity.

Conclusion: The framework successfully generates realistic workplace hazard images and provides a more effective evaluation metric for semantic fidelity and realism.

Abstract: Training vision models to detect workplace hazards accurately requires realistic images of unsafe conditions that could lead to accidents. However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced. Across four state-of-the-art generative models, the proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics based on entropy-based validation, confirming its higher discriminative sensitivity.

TL;DR: Proposes a rate-distortion theory framework for constructing and refining task-oriented knowledge graphs from educational materials, enabling automatic generation of high-quality multiple-choice questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Converting unstructured educational materials into knowledge graphs that capture key pedagogical content remains challenging, limiting the effectiveness of AI-powered learning assistants.

Method: Models lecture content as metric-measure space, aligns candidate KGs using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to quantify semantic distortion, and applies refinement operators to minimize rate-distortion Lagrangian.

Result: Applied to data science lectures, yields interpretable RD curves and shows MCQs from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria.

Conclusion: Establishes a principled foundation for information-theoretic KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education.

Abstract: Task-oriented knowledge graphs (KGs) enable AI-powered learning assistant systems to automatically generate high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria. This study establishes a principled foundation for information-theoretic KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle with adapting to evolving information due to static knowledge, and existing knowledge editing methods face scalability and retrieval efficiency challenges, especially for complex multi-hop questions requiring multi-step reasoning.

Method: ALEX uses hierarchical memory architecture to organize knowledge edits into semantic clusters, an Inferential Query Synthesis module to bridge semantic gaps between queries and facts, and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication engine for two-stage retrieval.

Result: On MQUAKE benchmark, ALEX significantly improves multi-hop answer accuracy (MultiHop-ACC) and reasoning path reliability (HopWise-ACC), while reducing required search space by over 80%.

Conclusion: ALEX presents a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems by addressing fundamental challenges in retrieval complexity and semantic reasoning.

Abstract: The static nature of knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult for them to adapt to evolving information, rendering knowledge editing a critical task. However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.

*Chiharu Hagiwara,Naoki Nonaka,Yuhta Hashimoto,Ryu Uchimido,Jun Seita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Syn-STARTS is an LLM-based framework that generates synthetic triage cases for mass casualty incidents, achieving quality comparable to manually curated datasets and enabling AI development for emergency medical situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mass casualty incidents require effective triage but occur infrequently, making it difficult to collect sufficient real-world data for AI development and evaluation.

Method: Developed Syn-STARTS framework using LLMs to generate synthetic triage cases, then compared them against manually curated TRIAGE dataset for quality assessment.

Result: Generated cases were qualitatively indistinguishable from manual curation, and LLM accuracy across all triage categories (green, yellow, red, black) was highly stable.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation using LLMs shows strong potential for developing high-performance AI models in critical medical situations where real data is scarce.

Abstract: Triage is a critically important decision-making process in mass casualty incidents (MCIs) to maximize victim survival rates. While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an integrated system for scientific and engineering workflows that ensures transparency, provenance tracking, and adaptability across research domains.

Method: Uses Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow with prompt-engineered agents coordinated via LangGraph's StateGraph, hybrid memory (FAISS + SQLite), incremental indexing, and configuration-driven customization.

Result: Successfully applied to multiple research areas at Argonne National Laboratory including waste-to-products research and energy process safety, demonstrating cross-domain applicability.

Conclusion: AISAC provides a flexible, transparent multi-agent framework for scientific workflows that can be customized for various research domains while maintaining full decision transparency.

Abstract: AI Scientific Assistant Core (AISAC) is an integrated multi-agent system developed at Argonne National Laboratory for scientific and engineering workflows. AISAC builds on established technologies - LangGraph for orchestration, FAISS for vector search, and SQLite for persistence - and integrates them into a unified system prototype focused on transparency, provenance tracking, and scientific adaptability.
  The system implements a Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow and an optional Evaluator role, using prompt-engineered agents coordinated via LangGraph's StateGraph and supported by helper agents such as a Researcher. Each role is defined through custom system prompts that enforce structured JSON outputs. A hybrid memory approach (FAISS + SQLite) enables both semantic retrieval and structured conversation history. An incremental indexing strategy based on file hashing minimizes redundant re-embedding when scientific corpora evolve. A configuration-driven project bootstrap layer allows research teams to customize tools, prompts, and data sources without modifying core code.
  All agent decisions, tool invocations, and retrievals are logged and visualized through a custom Gradio interface, providing step-by-step transparency for each reasoning episode. The authors have applied AISAC to multiple research areas at Argonne, including specialized deployments for waste-to-products research and energy process safety, as well as general-purpose scientific assistance, demonstrating its cross-domain applicability.

### [138] [Making Evidence Actionable in Adaptive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14052)
*Amirreza Mehrabi,Jason W. Morphew,Breejha Quezada,N. Sanjay Rebello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents an adaptive learning system with instructor-governed feedback that converts concept-level assessments into vetted micro-interventions using three safeguards: adequacy, attention, and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptive learning often provides precise diagnosis but weak interventions, resulting in mistimed or misaligned help that fails to effectively support learning.

Method: The system formalizes intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty, prerequisites, and anti-redundancy. It uses greedy selection for low-richness scenarios, gradient-based relaxation for rich repositories, and a hybrid method for the richness-latency frontier.

Result: In simulations and a deployment with 1,204 physics students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by ~12% compared to greedy while maintaining difficulty harmony.

Conclusion: The system provides a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop, delivering equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale while sustaining sufficiency across subgroups.

Abstract: Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, yielding help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.

*Adit Jain,Vikram Krishnamurthy,Yiming Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper models how networks of LLMs perform collaborative question-answering and analyzes how hallucinations spread through the network, using mean-field dynamics and randomized utility models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in networks where hallucinations can spread, causing previously accurate LLMs to also hallucinate.

Method: Combines mean-field dynamics from network science and randomized utility model from economics to model LLMs with latent states (truthful/non-truthful), analyzes fixed points in directed networks, and conducts experiments with 100 open-source LLMs.

Result: Establishes sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of fixed points, analyzes behavior with respect to incentives (test-time compute), and studies effects of data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and framing sensitivity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully models hallucination spread in LLM networks and provides analytical insights into network behavior under various conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we model and analyze how a network of interacting LLMs performs collaborative question-answering (CQA) in order to estimate a ground truth given a distributed set of documents. This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.

TL;DR: APD-agents is an LLM-driven multi-agent framework that automates mobile app page layout design by converting user descriptions into structured layouts through collaborative agent interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile app layout design is time-consuming and requires extensive training with design software. Collaborative design across pages demands additional effort for consistency.

Method: A multi-agent framework with five specialized agents: OrchestratorAgent coordinates tasks, SemanticParserAgent converts descriptions to structured data, PrimaryLayoutAgent generates initial layouts, TemplateRetrievalAgent fetches relevant examples, and RecursiveComponentAgent handles fine-grained sub-elements.

Result: Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance in automated page design.

Conclusion: The framework successfully leverages LLM-driven multi-agent collaboration to automate mobile app page design, reducing manual effort while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Layout design is a crucial step in developing mobile app pages. However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems. Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that our APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), financial information retrieval has become a critical industrial application. Extracting task-relevant information from lengthy financial filings is essential for both operational and analytical decision-making. The FinAgentBench dataset formalizes this problem through two tasks: document ranking and chunk ranking. We present PRISM, a training-free framework that integrates refined system prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and a lightweight multi-agent system. Each component is examined extensively to reveal their synergies: prompt engineering provides precise task instructions, ICL supplies semantically relevant few-shot examples, and the multi-agent system models coordinated scoring behaviour. Our best configuration achieves an NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on the restricted validation split. We further demonstrate that PRISM is feasible and robust for production-scale financial retrieval. Its modular, inference-only design makes it practical for real-world use cases. The source code is released at https://bit.ly/prism-ailens.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R3 is a dual-process framework that combines LLMs' generalization with VLN-specific expertise for vision-and-language navigation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on REVERIE benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with real-world spatial comprehension in VLN tasks and have high computational costs, creating a performance gap with domain experts despite their reasoning capabilities.

Method: Three-module framework: Runner (lightweight transformer expert for efficient navigation), Ruminator (multimodal LLM with chain-of-thought reasoning), and Regulator (monitors progress and controls thinking modes).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 3.28% SPL and 3.30% RGSPL on REVERIE benchmark, showing significant enhancement in challenging VLN tasks.

Conclusion: The dual-process thinking framework effectively integrates LLM generalization with domain expertise, achieving superior navigation performance while addressing computational efficiency concerns.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore complex 3D environments following human instructions. Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.

### [143] [Beyond Accuracy: A Multi-Dimensional Framework for Evaluating Enterprise Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14136)
*Sushant Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current AI agent benchmarks focus only on accuracy, missing enterprise needs like cost, reliability, and stability. The paper proposes CLEAR framework for holistic evaluation covering Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, and Reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook critical enterprise requirements such as cost-efficiency, reliability, and operational stability, leading to agents that perform well in labs but fail in production environments.

Method: Systematic analysis of 12 benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, followed by proposing CLEAR framework and evaluating six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks with expert validation (N=15).

Result: Found 50x cost variations for similar precision, agent performance drops from 60% (single run) to 25% (8-run consistency), and CLEAR predicts production success better (ρ=0.83) vs accuracy-only (ρ=0.41). Cost-aware alternatives are 4.4-10.8x cheaper than accuracy-optimized agents.

Conclusion: CLEAR framework provides more comprehensive evaluation for enterprise AI agents, addressing critical gaps in current benchmarking practices and better predicting real-world deployment success.

Abstract: Current agentic AI benchmarks predominantly evaluate task completion accuracy, while overlooking critical enterprise requirements such as cost-efficiency, reliability, and operational stability. Through systematic analysis of 12 main benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, we identify three fundamental limitations: (1) absence of cost-controlled evaluation leading to 50x cost variations for similar precision, (2) inadequate reliability assessment where agent performance drops from 60\% (single run) to 25\% (8-run consistency), and (3) missing multidimensional metrics for security, latency, and policy compliance. We propose \textbf{CLEAR} (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), a holistic evaluation framework specifically designed for enterprise deployment. Evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks demonstrates that optimizing for accuracy alone yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives with comparable performance. Expert evaluation (N=15) confirms that CLEAR better predicts production success (correlation $ρ=0.83$) compared to accuracy-only evaluation ($ρ=0.41$).

TL;DR: HFL-FlowLLM is the first framework applying large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning, achieving 13% higher F1 scores than state-of-the-art methods and reducing training costs by 87%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional centralized ML struggles with distributed data and privacy in 5G/IoT networks, while existing federated learning has high costs and poor generalization for network traffic classification.

Method: Proposed HFL-FlowLLM framework that applies large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning environments.

Result: 13% improvement in average F1 score over state-of-the-art methods, up to 5% improvement in F1 score with more clients, and 87% reduction in training costs compared to existing LLM federated learning frameworks.

Conclusion: HFL-FlowLLM demonstrates strong potential and practical value for network security in modern communication networks with compelling performance and robustness.

Abstract: In modern communication networks driven by 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), effective network traffic flow classification is crucial for Quality of Service (QoS) management and security. Traditional centralized machine learning struggles with the distributed data and privacy concerns in these heterogeneous environments, while existing federated learning approaches suffer from high costs and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose HFL-FlowLLM, which to our knowledge is the first framework to apply large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning. Compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods for network traffic flow classification, the proposed approach improves the average F1 score by approximately 13%, demonstrating compelling performance and strong robustness. When compared to existing large language models federated learning frameworks, as the number of clients participating in each training round increases, the proposed method achieves up to a 5% improvement in average F1 score while reducing the training costs by about 87%. These findings prove the potential and practical value of HFL-FlowLLM in modern communication networks security.

### [145] [Do Large Language Models (LLMs) Understand Chronology?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14214)
*Pattaraphon Kenny Wongchamcharoen,Paul Glasserman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with chronological ordering tasks despite knowing historical facts, with performance declining as sequence length increases, though explicit reasoning allocation helps improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether LLMs truly understand chronology when used in finance and economics applications, where look-ahead bias is a concern.

Method: Evaluated GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet (with/without Extended Thinking), and GPT-5 on three chronological tasks: ordering, conditional sorting (filter then order), and anachronism detection across multiple reasoning-effort settings.

Result: Exact match rates drop sharply with longer sequences, though rank correlations remain high. Conditional sorting failures mainly occur during filtering. GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking perform best, especially with medium/high reasoning effort.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in chronological reasoning, but allocating explicit reasoning budget significantly improves performance, with GPT-5 achieving flawless ordering at medium/high reasoning effort.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.

*Kumud Tripathi,Aditya Srinivas Menon,Aman Gaurav,Raj Prakash Gohil,Pankaj Wasnik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-stage architecture combining Adaptive Layer Attention and knowledge distillation to reduce hallucinations in Whisper ASR under noisy conditions while maintaining clean speech performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whisper ASR suffers from hallucination errors in noisy environments, and previous approaches focused on preprocessing/post-processing rather than modifying the model itself to directly mitigate hallucinations.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Adaptive Layer Attention groups encoder layers into semantic blocks and fuses them via multi-head attention for robust encoding; 2) Multi-objective knowledge distillation trains student on noisy audio to align with teacher processing clean inputs.

Result: Experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show significant reductions in hallucinations and word error rates while preserving performance on clean speech.

Conclusion: The combination of ALA and KD provides a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability in real-world noisy conditions.

Abstract: The Whisper model, an open-source automatic speech recognition system, is widely adopted for its strong performance across multilingual and zero-shot settings. However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.

Conclusion: DevPiolt effectively addresses IoT operation recommendation challenges and demonstrates strong performance both in offline experiments and real-world deployment, making it a practical solution for enhancing IoT user experiences.

Abstract: Operation recommendation for IoT devices refers to generating personalized device operations for users based on their context, such as historical operations, environment information, and device status. This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users. Online experiment results indicate a 21.6% increase in unique visitor device coverage and a 29.1% increase in page view acceptance rates.

### [148] [Enhancing Regional Airbnb Trend Forecasting Using LLM-Based Embeddings of Accessibility and Human Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14248)
*Hongju Lee,Youngjun Park,Jisun An,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel time-series forecasting framework for regional Airbnb market trends that integrates listing features with external factors, converts data to LLM prompts for embeddings, and uses advanced models to achieve 48% lower RMSE/MAE than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Airbnb expansion disrupts local housing markets, increasing rental prices and affordability issues. Accurate regional forecasting provides critical insights for policymakers and urban planners to mitigate these impacts.

Method: Uses sliding-window approach for 1-3 month forecasts, constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with urban accessibility and human mobility, converts tabular data to LLM prompts for embeddings, and feeds embeddings into RNN/LSTM/Transformer models.

Result: Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show 48% reduction in average RMSE and MAE compared to traditional statistical and machine learning baselines.

Conclusion: The framework improves forecasting accuracy and provides practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.

Abstract: The expansion of short-term rental platforms, such as Airbnb, has significantly disrupted local housing markets, often leading to increased rental prices and housing affordability issues. Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PathMind is a novel framework that enhances knowledge graph reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths through a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm, outperforming existing methods with fewer input tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based KGR methods face two limitations: indiscriminate path extraction that introduces irrelevant noise, and high retrieval demands with frequent LLM calls during dynamic path exploration.

Method: PathMind follows a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm: retrieves query subgraph, introduces semantic-aware path prioritization considering accumulative and future costs, and uses dual-phase training with instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens by identifying essential reasoning paths.

Conclusion: PathMind effectively addresses limitations of existing LLM-based KGR methods by selectively guiding LLMs with important paths, achieving more faithful and interpretable reasoning with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is the task of inferring new knowledge by performing logical deductions on knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a "Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.

Method: Proposes DataSage with three key features: external knowledge retrieval to enrich analytical context, multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse perspectives and deepen analysis, and multi-path reasoning to improve code and insight accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments on InsightBench show DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, demonstrating superior performance in automated data insight discovery.

Conclusion: DataSage provides an effective solution for automated data insight discovery by addressing key limitations of current approaches through its multi-agent framework with enhanced knowledge integration, analytical depth, and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: In today's data-driven era, fully automated end-to-end data analytics, particularly insight discovery, is critical for discovering actionable insights that assist organizations in making effective decisions. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for automating data analysis and insight discovery. However, existing data insight agents remain limited in several key aspects, often failing to deliver satisfactory results due to: (1) insufficient utilization of domain knowledge, (2) shallow analytical depth, and (3) error-prone code generation during insight generation. To address these issues, we propose DataSage, a novel multi-agent framework that incorporates three innovative features including external knowledge retrieval to enrich the analytical context, a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analytical depth, and multi-path reasoning to improve the accuracy of the generated code and insights. Extensive experiments on InsightBench demonstrate that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for automated data insight discovery.

*Alessio Pellegrino,Jacopo Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can generate models for standard constraint problems but fail when problems are rephrased or modified, suggesting their success comes from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether LLMs' apparent success in automatically generating constraint programming models stems from genuine reasoning or data contamination of standard benchmarks.

Method: Systematically rephrased and perturbed well-known CSPLib problems while preserving structure, then compared model generation performance across original vs modified descriptions using three representative LLMs.

Result: LLMs produce syntactically valid models for original problems but performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, showing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

Conclusion: LLMs' model generation capabilities appear to derive more from data contamination than genuine reasoning, as they struggle with structurally similar but contextually modified problems.

Abstract: One of the long-standing goals in optimisation and constraint programming is to describe a problem in natural language and automatically obtain an executable, efficient model. Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM alignment often ignores human social diversity. This study shows incorporating pluralistic values from diverse demographics significantly affects LLM behavior, with systematic demographic variations in ratings and technical design choices impacting alignment outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment approaches overlook human social diversity, focusing on uniform human feedback without considering demographic variations in values and preferences.

Method: Collected alignment data from 1,095 US and German participants (27,375 ratings) across 5 dimensions. Fine-tuned LLMs using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques.

Result: Systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than females; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants. Technical choices showed strong effects: preserving rater disagreement achieved 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded 22% more reduction than binary formats.

Conclusion: Alignment should balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation, with technical design choices significantly impacting how pluralistic values are incorporated into LLM behavior.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using human feedback for safety and alignment with human values, alignment decisions often overlook human social diversity. This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic framework that bridges perception and planning by modeling uncertainty, achieving high success rates in robotic manipulation tasks while providing theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental challenge of connecting continuous perceptual signals with discrete symbolic reasoning under uncertainty in AI systems.

Method: Combines transformer-based perceptual front-end with GNN relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states, coupled with uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low.

Result: Achieved 94%/90%/88% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7% average), exceeding POMDP baselines by 10-14 points while planning within 15ms. Translator processed 10,047 scenes with F1=0.68.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled connection between perception and planning with calibrated uncertainty, is general-purpose, and establishes quantitative links between uncertainty and planning convergence with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Bridging continuous perceptual signals and discrete symbolic reasoning is a fundamental challenge in AI systems that must operate under uncertainty. We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\%/90\%/88\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically. The framework is general-purpose and can be applied to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perceptual input to symbolic planning.

TL;DR: AutoTool is a graph-based framework that reduces LLM inference costs in agent frameworks by exploiting tool usage inertia patterns from historical trajectories, achieving up to 30% cost reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent frameworks suffer from high inference costs due to repeated LLM calls for tool selection, particularly in approaches like ReAct that invoke LLMs at each step to determine which tool to use.

Method: Constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, modeling tool usage inertia. Integrates parameter-level information for tool input generation and traverses this graph to select tools with minimal LLM inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates across diverse agent tasks.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for automating complex tasks by leveraging the reasoning and decision-making abilities of LLMs. However, a major bottleneck in current agent frameworks lies in the high inference cost of tool selection, especially in approaches like ReAct that repeatedly invoke the LLM to determine which tool to use at each step. In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance.

*Ran Tamir,Nir Weinberger,Albert Guillén i Fàbregas*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper completes the proof of a conjecture about DNA storage capacity in the short-molecule regime, establishing optimal scaling bounds and proposing efficient coding schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the fundamental limits of information storage in DNA-based systems using short molecules, addressing a conjecture by Shomorony and Heckel (2022) about the scaling behavior of reliable information storage capacity.

Method: Analyzed a random-coding scheme with quantized probability mass functions from the probability simplex, studied optimal maximum-likelihood decoding, and proposed a second computationally efficient coding scheme.

Result: Derived an achievability bound that matches the previously established converse bound across the entire short-molecule regime, confirming the conjecture's scaling behavior.

Conclusion: The conjecture about DNA storage capacity scaling in the short-molecule regime is proven, with optimal coding schemes achieving the fundamental limits except for a narrow range of very short molecules.

Abstract: We study the amount of reliable information that can be stored in a DNA-based storage system composed of short DNA molecules. In this regime, Shomorony and Heckel (2022) put forward a conjecture on the scaling of the number of information bits that can be reliably stored. In this paper, we complete the proof of this conjecture. We analyze a random-coding scheme in which each codeword is obtained by quantizing a randomly generated probability mass function drawn from the probability simplex. By analyzing the optimal maximum-likelihood decoder, we derive an achievability bound that matches a recently established converse bound across the entire short-molecule regime. We also propose a second coding scheme, which operates with significantly lower computational complexity but achieves the optimal scaling, except for a specific range of very short molecules.

*Zhou Li,Xiang Zhang,Yizhou Zhao,Haiqiang Chen,Jihao Fan,Giuseppe Caire*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper studies decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) with groupwise secret keys, establishing fundamental limits on communication and key rates when users compute sums of inputs while preventing collusion attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by recent advances in efficient group-based key generation protocols for decentralized learning systems, where users need to compute sums of inputs securely without revealing individual data.

Method: Analyzes DSA under symmetric groupwise key setting where subsets of G users share independent group keys, characterizing optimal rate region for communication and key rates.

Result: Shows DSA is infeasible when G=1 or G≥K-T; otherwise for 2≤G<K-T, each user must broadcast ≥1 symbol and each group key must contain ≥(K-T-2)/binom(K-T-1,G) independent symbols per computed sum symbol.

Conclusion: Establishes fundamental limits for DSA with groupwise keys, providing design insights for communication- and key-efficient secure aggregation in decentralized learning systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the information-theoretic decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) problem under practical groupwise secret keys and collusion resilience. In DSA, $K$ users are interconnected through error-free broadcast channels. Each user holds a private input and aims to compute the sum of all other users' inputs, while satisfying the security constraint that no user, even when colluding with up to $T$ other users, can infer any information about the inputs beyond the recovered sum. To ensure security, users are equipped with secret keys to mask their inputs. Motivated by recent advances in efficient group-based key generation protocols, we consider the symmetric groupwise key setting, where every subset of $G$ users shares a group key that is independent of all other group keys. The problem is challenging because the recovery and security constraints must hold simultaneously for all users, and the structural constraints on the secret keys limit the flexibility of key correlations. We characterize the optimal rate region consisting of all achievable pairs of per-user broadcast communication rate and groupwise key rate. In particular, we show that DSA with groupwise keys is infeasible when $G=1$ or $G\ge K-T$. Otherwise, when $2\le G<K-T$, to securely compute one symbol of the desired sum, each user must broadcast at least one symbol, and each group key must contain at least $(K-T-2)/\binom{K-T-1}{G}$ independent symbols. Our results establish the fundamental limits of DSA with groupwise keys and provide design insights for communication- and key-efficient secure aggregation in decentralized learning systems.

TL;DR: A neural network-based data-driven approach for channel reconstruction in fluid antenna systems that achieves high accuracy with low computational complexity, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fluid antenna systems offer spatial diversity but require accurate channel state information. Current channel reconstruction methods lack general applicability with both high precision and computational efficiency.

Method: Proposed a data-driven channel reconstruction framework using neural networks to handle both model-based and model-free scenarios.

Result: The approach achieves significantly enhanced reconstruction accuracy with substantially lower computational complexity compared to existing model-free methods, demonstrating rapid convergence and robust performance.

Conclusion: The neural network-based framework provides an effective solution for channel reconstruction in fluid antenna systems, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FASs) offer substantial spatial diversity by exploiting the electromagnetic port correlation within compact array spaces, thereby generating favorable small-scale fading conditions with beneficial channel gain envelope fluctuations. This unique capability opens new opportunities for a wide range of communication applications and emerging technologies. However, accurate channel state information (CSI) must be acquired before a fluid antenna can be effectively utilized. Although several efforts have been made toward channel reconstruction in FASs, a generally applicable solution to both model-based or model-free scenario with both high precision and efficient computational flow remains lacking. In this work, we propose a data-driven channel reconstruction approach enabled by neural networks. The proposed framework not only achieves significantly enhanced reconstruction accuracy but also requires substantially lower computational complexity compared with existing model-free methods. Numerical results further demonstrate the rapid convergence and robust reconstruction capability of the proposed scheme, outperforming current state-of-the-art techniques.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SCOPE is a self-supervised framework that jointly performs compression and artifact correction for real-time imaging sonar, achieving 40% SSIM improvement and 80% bandwidth reduction while running in real-time on embedded systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in underwater monitoring where optical sensing is unreliable: limited uplink bandwidth and severe sonar-specific artifacts affecting up to 98% of frames.

Method: Combines Adaptive Codebook Compression (ACC) for frequency-encoded latent representations with Frequency-Aware Multiscale Segmentation (FAMS) that decomposes frames into low-frequency structure and sparse high-frequency dynamics, using hedging training strategy with low-pass proxy pairs.

Result: Achieves SSIM of 0.77 (40% improvement over baselines) at bitrates ≤0.0118 bpp, reduces uplink bandwidth by >80%, runs in real-time with 3.1ms encoding on embedded GPU, and has been deployed for months in Pacific Northwest rivers.

Conclusion: Learning frequency-structured latents enables practical, low-bitrate sonar streaming with preserved signal details under real-world deployment conditions.

Abstract: Real-time imaging sonar has become an important tool for underwater monitoring in environments where optical sensing is unreliable. Its broader use is constrained by two coupled challenges: highly limited uplink bandwidth and severe sonar-specific artifacts (speckle, motion blur, reverberation, acoustic shadows) that affect up to 98% of frames. We present SCOPE, a self-supervised framework that jointly performs compression and artifact correction without clean-noise pairs or synthetic assumptions. SCOPE combines (i) Adaptive Codebook Compression (ACC), which learns frequency-encoded latent representations tailored to sonar, with (ii) Frequency-Aware Multiscale Segmentation (FAMS), which decomposes frames into low-frequency structure and sparse high-frequency dynamics while suppressing rapidly fluctuating artifacts. A hedging training strategy further guides frequency-aware learning using low-pass proxy pairs generated without labels. Evaluated on months of in-situ ARIS sonar data, SCOPE achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.77, representing a 40% improvement over prior self-supervised denoising baselines, at bitrates down to <= 0.0118 bpp. It reduces uplink bandwidth by more than 80% while improving downstream detection. The system runs in real time, with 3.1 ms encoding on an embedded GPU and 97 ms full multi-layer decoding on the server end. SCOPE has been deployed for months in three Pacific Northwest rivers to support real-time salmon enumeration and environmental monitoring in the wild. Results demonstrate that learning frequency-structured latents enables practical, low-bitrate sonar streaming with preserved signal details under real-world deployment conditions.

TL;DR: PoCGM adapts PFGM++ for sparse-view CT reconstruction by incorporating conditional inputs, achieving superior artifact suppression and detail preservation compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing projection views in CT lowers radiation exposure but causes severe aliasing artifacts and loss of structural details, limiting clinical applications.

Method: Reformulates PFGM++ into a conditional generative framework that incorporates sparse-view data as guidance during training and sampling, modeling the posterior distribution of full-view reconstructions conditioned on sparse observations.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show PoCGM outperforms baselines with improved artifact suppression, enhanced detail preservation, and reliable performance in dose-sensitive and time-critical scenarios.

Conclusion: PoCGM effectively addresses sparse-view CT reconstruction challenges by adapting PFGM++ to medical imaging tasks, demonstrating superior performance in artifact reduction and structural detail preservation.

Abstract: In computed tomography (CT), reducing the number of projection views is an effective strategy to lower radiation exposure and/or improve temporal resolution. However, this often results in severe aliasing artifacts and loss of structural details in reconstructed images, posing significant challenges for clinical applications. Inspired by the success of the Poisson Flow Generative Model (PFGM++) in natural image generation, we propose a PoCGM (Poisson-Conditioned Generative Model) to address the challenges of sparse-view CT reconstruction. Since PFGM++ was originally designed for unconditional generation, it lacks direct applicability to medical imaging tasks that require integrating conditional inputs. To overcome this limitation, the PoCGM reformulates PFGM++ into a conditional generative framework by incorporating sparse-view data as guidance during both training and sampling phases. By modeling the posterior distribution of full-view reconstructions conditioned on sparse observations, PoCGM effectively suppresses artifacts while preserving fine structural details. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that PoCGM outperforms the baselines, achieving improved artifact suppression, enhanced detail preservation, and reliable performance in dose-sensitive and time-critical imaging scenarios.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ELiC is a real-time LiDAR geometry compression framework that improves efficiency through cross-bit-depth feature propagation, Bag-of-Encoders selection, and Morton-order-preserving hierarchy, achieving state-of-the-art compression performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior hierarchical LiDAR compression methods treat each depth independently and re-estimate local context from coordinates at every level, which limits compression efficiency and computational performance.

Method: Combines three key components: 1) Cross-bit-depth feature propagation that reuses features from denser lower depths for sparser higher depths, 2) Bag-of-Encoders selection scheme that chooses the most suitable coding network per depth from a small pool, and 3) Morton-order-preserving hierarchy that maintains global Z-order across depth transitions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art compression performance at real-time throughput on Ford and SemanticKITTI datasets, with improved entropy modeling and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed ELiC framework successfully addresses limitations of prior hierarchical compression methods by enabling feature reuse, adaptive network selection, and efficient global ordering, delivering superior compression performance in real-time applications.

Abstract: Hierarchical LiDAR geometry compression encodes voxel occupancies from low to high bit-depths, yet prior methods treat each depth independently and re-estimate local context from coordinates at every level, limiting compression efficiency. We present ELiC, a real-time framework that combines cross-bit-depth feature propagation, a Bag-of-Encoders (BoE) selection scheme, and a Morton-order-preserving hierarchy. Cross-bit-depth propagation reuses features extracted at denser, lower depths to support prediction at sparser, higher depths. BoE selects, per depth, the most suitable coding network from a small pool, adapting capacity to observed occupancy statistics without training a separate model for each level. The Morton hierarchy maintains global Z-order across depth transitions, eliminating per-level sorting and reducing latency. Together these components improve entropy modeling and computation efficiency, yielding state-of-the-art compression at real-time throughput on Ford and SemanticKITTI. Code and models will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: XPINN framework dynamically decomposes domain to solve nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation, achieving superior shock capturing and faster convergence than standard PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PINNs struggle with steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions in hyperbolic PDEs like the Buckley-Leverett equation.

Method: Extended PINN (XPINN) with dynamic domain decomposition into pre-shock/post-shock regions, using Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition for subnetwork coupling.

Result: Accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without artificial diffusion, with superior stability and faster convergence.

Conclusion: XPINN is an effective, scalable tool for challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems, outperforming standard PINNs with smaller models.

Abstract: The accurate solution of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a central challenge in computational science due to the presence of steep gradients, discontinuities, and multiscale structures that make conventional discretization-based solvers computationally demanding. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, this study employs the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux function, which models immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors. Coupling between subnetworks is achieved through the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, which enforces physically consistent flux continuity across the moving shock interface. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed XPINN approach accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without requiring artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Compared to standard PINNs, the XPINN framework achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and enhanced resolution of nonlinear wave dynamics using smaller, domain-specific models with fewer trainable parameters, establishing it as an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BLUE is a trajectory representation learning method that uses blurred encoding with hierarchical patches to preserve both fine-grained spatial-temporal details and overall travel patterns, outperforming SOTA methods by 30.90% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TRL methods lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details when transforming GPS trajectories to grid or road representations, as multiple GPS points are grouped into single cells or segments.

Method: BLUE gradually reduces GPS coordinate precision to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels, using an encoder-decoder Transformer model with pyramid structure. Low-level patches preserve details while high-level patches capture overall patterns.

Result: BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than 8 SOTA TRL methods across 3 downstream tasks, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%.

Conclusion: The hierarchical patch approach with blurred encoding effectively balances fine-grained details and high-level semantics, providing superior trajectory representation learning performance.

Abstract: Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vector embeddings and facilitates tasks such as trajectory classification and similarity search. State-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods transform raw GPS trajectories to grid or road trajectories to capture high-level travel semantics, i.e., regions and roads. However, they lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details as multiple GPS points are grouped into a single grid cell or road segment. To tackle this problem, we propose the BLUrred Encoding method, dubbed BLUE, which gradually reduces the precision of GPS coordinates to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels. The low-level patches are small and preserve fine-grained spatial-temporal details, while the high-level patches are large and capture overall travel patterns. To complement different patch levels with each other, our BLUE is an encoder-decoder model with a pyramid structure. At each patch level, a Transformer is used to learn the trajectory embedding at the current level, while pooling prepares inputs for the higher level in the encoder, and up-resolution provides guidance for the lower level in the decoder. BLUE is trained using the trajectory reconstruction task with the MSE loss. We compare BLUE with 8 SOTA TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, the results show that BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%.

TL;DR: DeepDefense is a novel defense framework that uses Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) regularization across multiple layers to suppress adversarial vulnerability by aligning input gradients with internal features, promoting a smoother loss landscape.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations - small crafted inputs that cause incorrect predictions. There's a need for effective defense mechanisms against these attacks.

Method: Proposes Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) regularization that aligns input gradients with internal feature representations across multiple layers to suppress adversarial vulnerability by reducing loss variation in tangential directions.

Result: Significant robustness improvements: 15.2% better than standard adversarial training under APGD attacks and 24.7% under FGSM attacks on CIFAR-10. Against optimization-based attacks like DeepFool and EADEN, requires 20-30 times higher perturbation magnitudes to cause misclassification.

Conclusion: DeepDefense is architecture-agnostic, simple to implement, and highly effective, offering a promising direction for improving adversarial robustness of deep learning models through gradient-feature alignment and smoother loss landscapes.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which are small and carefully crafted inputs that lead to incorrect predictions. In this paper, we propose DeepDefense, a novel defense framework that applies Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) regularization across multiple layers to suppress adversarial vulnerability. By aligning input gradients with internal feature representations, DeepDefense promotes a smoother loss landscape in tangential directions, thereby reducing the model's sensitivity to adversarial noise.
  We provide theoretical insights into how adversarial perturbation can be decomposed into radial and tangential components and demonstrate that alignment suppresses loss variation in tangential directions, where most attacks are effective. Empirically, our method achieves significant improvements in robustness across both gradient-based and optimization-based attacks. For example, on CIFAR-10, CNN models trained with DeepDefense outperform standard adversarial training by up to 15.2% under APGD attacks and 24.7% under FGSM attacks. Against optimization-based attacks such as DeepFool and EADEN, DeepDefense requires 20 to 30 times higher perturbation magnitudes to cause misclassification, indicating stronger decision boundaries and a flatter loss landscape. Our approach is architecture-agnostic, simple to implement, and highly effective, offering a promising direction for improving the adversarial robustness of deep learning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for analyzing biases in diffusion models are limited to predefined categories or manual interpretation, restricting scalability and discovery of subtle patterns.

Method: Extracts semantically meaningful directions from H-space using natural language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labeling.

Result: Detects gender bias in profession prompts, ranks semantic alignment across identity descriptors, and reveals clustered conceptual structure without supervision.

Conclusion: SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models more scalable, interpretable, and extensible by directly linking prompts to latent directions.

Abstract: Image generation models frequently encode social biases, including stereotypes tied to gender, race, and profession. Existing methods for analyzing these biases in diffusion models either focus narrowly on predefined categories or depend on manual interpretation of latent directions. These constraints limit scalability and hinder the discovery of subtle or unanticipated patterns.
  We introduce SCALEX, a framework for scalable and automated exploration of diffusion model latent spaces. SCALEX extracts semantically meaningful directions from H-space using only natural language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labelling. This allows systematic comparison across arbitrary concepts and large-scale discovery of internal model associations. We show that SCALEX detects gender bias in profession prompts, ranks semantic alignment across identity descriptors, and reveals clustered conceptual structure without supervision. By linking prompts to latent directions directly, SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models more scalable, interpretable, and extensible than prior approaches.

TL;DR: Proposes a brain region-specific channel selection and multi-domain feature fusion method for EEG-based BCI systems to improve motor imagery classification accuracy by reducing data dimensionality and enhancing feature relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signals in BCIs have high dimensionality due to multichannel nature, requiring efficient information processing to reduce computational complexity while maintaining classification performance for motor imagery tasks.

Method: Brain region-based channel selection groups EEG channels by functional relevance, then applies three feature extraction methods (CSP for spatial patterns, Fuzzy C-means for clustering, TSM for non-linear patterns) to each region group, with SVM classification on the combined feature vector.

Result: Achieved classification accuracies of 90.77% on dataset IVA and 84.50% on dataset I from BCI competition III and IV, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed region-based channel selection with multi-domain feature fusion effectively improves motor imagery classification accuracy in BCI systems by focusing on relevant brain regions and capturing diverse signal characteristics.

Abstract: A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) connects the human brain to the outside world, providing a direct communication channel. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are commonly used in BCIs to reflect cognitive patterns related to motor function activities. However, due to the multichannel nature of EEG signals, explicit information processing is crucial to lessen computational complexity in BCI systems. This study proposes an innovative method based on brain region-specific channel selection and multi-domain feature fusion to improve classification accuracy. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in region-based channel selection, where EEG channels are grouped according to their functional relevance to distinct brain regions. By selecting channels based on specific regions involved in motor imagery (MI) tasks, this technique eliminates irrelevant channels, reducing data dimensionality and improving computational efficiency. This also ensures that the extracted features are more reflective of the brain actual activity related to motor tasks. Three distinct feature extraction methods Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), Fuzzy C-means clustering, and Tangent Space Mapping (TSM), are applied to each group of channels based on their brain region. Each method targets different characteristics of the EEG signal: CSP focuses on spatial patterns, Fuzzy C means identifies clusters within the data, and TSM captures non-linear patterns in the signal. The combined feature vector is used to classify motor imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, and right foot) using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed method was validated on publicly available benchmark EEG datasets (IVA and I) from the BCI competition III and IV. The results show that the approach outperforms existing methods, achieving classification accuracies of 90.77% and 84.50% for datasets IVA and I, respectively.

*Marios Papamichals,Regina Ruane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Radial Compensation (RC) is an information-geometric method that decouples curvature from model parameters in manifold generative models, enabling stable training and improved performance across various applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models on curved spaces entangle curvature with model parameters, leading to high gradient variance, poor test likelihoods, and numerical instability in high-dimensional flows.

Method: RC selects base density in tangent space so likelihood depends only on geodesic distance, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. Introduces Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family that balances volume distortion and geodesic error.

Result: RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. Improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows.

Conclusion: RC-bExp provides a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds by decoupling curvature effects from model parameters and enabling numerical preconditioning.

Abstract: Generative models on curved spaces rely on charts to map Euclidean spaces to manifolds. Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs showing promise for automated driving systems by transforming driving contexts into language representations, their robustness for safety-critical applications remains unexplored, raising concerns about trustworthiness.

Method: Proposed a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles in LLM input prompts under black-box settings, tested on the highD dataset.

Result: Experiments show even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, revealing high susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. Found a trade-off between accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: This study provides first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models and highlights the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated driving systems has opened new possibilities for reasoning and decision-making by transforming complex driving contexts into language-understandable representations. Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.

TL;DR: RedReg addresses modality bias in multimodal learning by adaptively regulating redundant information using a redundancy phase monitor and co-information gating mechanism, achieving balanced optimization across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal learning methods suffer from modality bias where dominant modalities dominate training, leading to imbalanced optimization, weakened representation-output coupling, and accumulation of redundant information in late training stages.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Redundancy Regulation (RedReg) with: 1) Redundancy phase monitor using effective gain growth rate and redundancy criteria; 2) Co-information gating mechanism to estimate dominant modality contribution; 3) Gradient projection onto orthogonal complement of joint multimodal gradient subspace with redundancy-based suppression.

Result: Experiments show superiority over current major methods in most scenarios, with ablation studies confirming method effectiveness.

Conclusion: RedReg successfully addresses modality bias by adaptively regulating redundant information while preserving modality-specific information when needed, achieving balanced multimodal optimization.

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to improve performance by leveraging data from multiple sources. During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes adapting deep lattice networks for nonparametric probabilistic forecasting to prevent quantile crossovers and produce implicit CDFs in time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probabilistic forecasting captures sudden changes better than point prediction, and current CDF modeling is limited to parametric approaches. The authors aim to connect probabilistic forecasting with monotonic networks to enable nonparametric CDF forecasting.

Method: Adaptation of deep lattice networks (DLN) with LSTM embedding layers for simultaneous quantile regression, spreading quantile inputs to all sub-lattices to prevent quantile crossovers through monotonic constraints.

Result: The adapted DLN performs as well or better than unconstrained approaches, and outperforms scalable monotonic neural networks in solar irradiance forecasting experiments.

Conclusion: The DLN adaptation successfully enables nonparametric probabilistic forecasting and creates opportunities for further crossover between monotonic neural networks and probabilistic forecasting techniques.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting is not only a way to add more information to a prediction of the future, but it also builds on weaknesses in point prediction. Sudden changes in a time series can still be captured by a cumulative distribution function (CDF), while a point prediction is likely to miss it entirely. The modeling of CDFs within forecasts has historically been limited to parametric approaches, but due to recent advances, this no longer has to be the case. We aim to advance the fields of probabilistic forecasting and monotonic networks by connecting them and propose an approach that permits the forecasting of implicit, complete, and nonparametric CDFs. For this purpose, we propose an adaptation to deep lattice networks (DLN) for monotonically constrained simultaneous/implicit quantile regression in time series forecasting. Quantile regression usually produces quantile crossovers, which need to be prevented to achieve a legitimate CDF. By leveraging long short term memory units (LSTM) as the embedding layer, and spreading quantile inputs to all sub-lattices of a DLN with an extended output size, we can produce a multi-horizon forecast of an implicit CDF due to the monotonic constraintability of DLNs that prevent quantile crossovers. We compare and evaluate our approach's performance to relevant state of the art within the context of a highly relevant application of time series forecasting: Day-ahead, hourly forecasts of solar irradiance observations. Our experiments show that the adaptation of a DLN performs just as well or even better than an unconstrained approach. Further comparison of the adapted DLN against a scalable monotonic neural network shows that our approach performs better. With this adaptation of DLNs, we intend to create more interest and crossover investigations in techniques of monotonic neural networks and probabilistic forecasting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning molecular generation models often produce chemically invalid molecules, limiting their practical applications in drug discovery by restricting the usable chemical space.

Conclusion: ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space, with demonstrated effectiveness in data-limited scenarios and extensibility to downstream tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning-based molecular generation models have shown great potential in efficiently exploring vast chemical spaces by generating potential drug candidates with desired properties. However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.

TL;DR: A self-training framework using multi-agent vision-language models for offensive content detection on social media when labeled data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of limited labeled data for offensive content detection due to low prevalence and high annotation costs.

Method: Iterative pseudo-labeling with MA-VLMs, creating Agreed-Unknown and Disagreed-Unknown sets, using dual-perspective simulation and PNU loss for optimization.

Result: Substantially outperforms baselines under limited supervision and approaches large-scale model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed self-training framework effectively leverages unlabeled data to improve offensive content detection in low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate detection of offensive content on social media demands high-quality labeled data; however, such data is often scarce due to the low prevalence of offensive instances and the high cost of manual annotation. To address this low-resource challenge, we propose a self-training framework that leverages abundant unlabeled data through collaborative pseudo-labeling. Starting with a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, our method iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances with the support of Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms baselines under limited supervision and approaches the performance of large-scale models

### [175] [MoETTA: Test-Time Adaptation Under Mixed Distribution Shifts with MoE-LayerNorm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13760)
*Xiao Fan,Jingyan Jiang,Zhaoru Chen,Fanding Huang,Xiao Chen,Qinting Jiang,Bowen Zhang,Xing Tang,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoETTA is a novel test-time adaptation framework that uses Mixture-of-Experts architecture to handle mixed distribution shifts by enabling diverse gradient directions for different domains, outperforming existing methods on realistic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployments face mixed distribution shifts with conflicting domain factors, but current TTA methods use unified adaptation paths that fail to account for varying optimal gradient directions across domains. Existing benchmarks also don't capture real-world heterogeneous shifts.

Method: Proposes MoETTA framework integrating Mixture-of-Experts architecture with structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions through flexible parameter updates. Introduces two new benchmarks (potpourri and potpourri+) for realistic mixed shifts.

Result: Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shift settings show MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.

Conclusion: MoETTA effectively addresses mixed distribution shifts through expert-level diversity in adaptation directions, proving superior to unified adaptation approaches and highlighting the importance of accommodating heterogeneous shifts in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Test-Time adaptation (TTA) has proven effective in mitigating performance drops under single-domain distribution shifts by updating model parameters during inference. However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.

*Jiaxin Qi,Yan Cui,Jianqiang Huang,Gaogang Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a gene incremental learning framework for single-cell transcriptomics data, adapting class incremental learning methods to address forgetting issues with biological tokens (genes).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While class incremental learning is well-studied in computer vision, token incremental learning (especially for biological tokens like genes) remains largely unexplored due to the holistic nature of tokens in language.

Method: Adapted existing class incremental learning methods to gene incremental learning for single-cell transcriptomics data, establishing a pipeline and evaluation framework.

Result: Demonstrated that forgetting problems exist in gene incremental learning and showed the effectiveness of adapted methods through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Provides a complete benchmark for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics, establishing sound framework design and effective method adaptations.

Abstract: Classes, as fundamental elements of Computer Vision, have been extensively studied within incremental learning frameworks. In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated the soundness of our framework design and evaluations, as well as the effectiveness of our method adaptations. Finally, we provide a complete benchmark for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics.

TL;DR: A compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels using MLIR dialects, eliminating the need for handcrafted kernels or specialized libraries while achieving near-optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between high-level domain operations and efficient hardware utilization requires deep hardware expertise, adding complexity and limiting scalability for ML practitioners who currently rely on handcrafted kernels or specialized libraries.

Method: Leverages MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities, using a mechanism to compose nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target.

Result: Generated nanokernels are production-quality and competitive with state-of-the-art microkernel libraries, as demonstrated through experiments.

Conclusion: The approach successfully removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling compilers to auto-generate near-optimal code directly, providing a scalable solution for high-performance microkernel generation.

Abstract: The rapidly evolving landscape of AI and machine learning workloads has widened the gap between high-level domain operations and efficient hardware utilization. Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.
  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target. We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions. Experiments show that the generated nanokernels are of production-quality, and competitive with state-of-the-art microkernel libraries.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PROF is a novel offline imitation learning framework that uses LLMs to generate and refine executable reward functions from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory, achieving state-of-the-art performance on D4RL benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing offline IL methods oversimplify reward structures by assuming trajectory-expert similarity directly correlates with rewards, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments.

Method: PROF uses LLMs to generate reward function codes, then applies Reward Preference Ranking (RPR) to assess reward quality without environment interactions, and alternates between RPR and text-based gradient optimization for automated refinement.

Result: Empirical results on D4RL show PROF surpasses or matches recent strong baselines across multiple datasets and domains.

Conclusion: PROF demonstrates the effectiveness of automated reward function generation and refinement using LLMs for offline imitation learning, providing a scalable approach without requiring explicit reward annotations.

Abstract: Offline imitation learning (offline IL) enables training effective policies without requiring explicit reward annotations. Recent approaches attempt to estimate rewards for unlabeled datasets using a small set of expert demonstrations. However, these methods often assume that the similarity between a trajectory and an expert demonstration is positively correlated with the reward, which oversimplifies the underlying reward structure. We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training. RPR calculates the dominance scores of the reward functions, where higher scores indicate better alignment with expert preferences. By alternating between RPR and text-based gradient optimization, PROF fully automates the selection and refinement of optimal reward functions for downstream policy learning. Empirical results on D4RL demonstrate that PROF surpasses or matches recent strong baselines across numerous datasets and domains, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: Credal Ensemble Distillation (CED) compresses deep ensembles into a single model (CREDIT) that predicts class-wise probability intervals instead of single distributions, achieving comparable uncertainty estimation with much lower inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep ensembles provide excellent uncertainty quantification but have high computational and memory costs during inference, limiting practical deployment.

Method: Propose CED framework that distills a deep ensemble into a single CREDIT model that outputs class-wise probability intervals defining credal sets for uncertainty quantification.

Result: Empirical results show CED achieves superior or comparable uncertainty estimation on OOD detection benchmarks while substantially reducing inference overhead compared to deep ensembles.

Conclusion: CED effectively compresses deep ensembles into a single model that maintains strong uncertainty quantification capabilities while dramatically reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Deep ensembles (DE) have emerged as a powerful approach for quantifying predictive uncertainty and distinguishing its aleatoric and epistemic components, thereby enhancing model robustness and reliability. However, their high computational and memory costs during inference pose significant challenges for wide practical deployment. To overcome this issue, we propose credal ensemble distillation (CED), a novel framework that compresses a DE into a single model, CREDIT, for classification tasks. Instead of a single softmax probability distribution, CREDIT predicts class-wise probability intervals that define a credal set, a convex set of probability distributions, for uncertainty quantification. Empirical results on out-of-distribution detection benchmarks demonstrate that CED achieves superior or comparable uncertainty estimation compared to several existing baselines, while substantially reducing inference overhead compared to DE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS) adapts temperature during knowledge distillation training based on teacher-student loss gap, outperforming fixed-temperature methods across vision and NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed temperature in knowledge distillation is suboptimal, and architectural differences cause logit magnitude mismatches between teacher and student models.

Method: DTS dynamically adjusts temperature based on cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student, adapting to distribution divergence throughout training.

Result: DTS consistently outperforms static-temperature baselines across multiple KD strategies on vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI) tasks.

Conclusion: Dynamic temperature scheduling based on teacher-student divergence is more effective than fixed temperature in knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) trains a smaller student model using a large, pre-trained teacher model, with temperature as a key hyperparameter controlling the softness of output probabilities. Traditional methods use a fixed temperature throughout training, which is suboptimal. Moreover, architectural differences between teacher and student often result in mismatched logit magnitudes. We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with existing KD frameworks. We validate DTS across multiple KD strategies on vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP tasks (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI), consistently outperforming static-temperature baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cajal is a programming language that compiles discrete algorithms into differentiable linear neurons, enabling direct programming of neural networks alongside gradient-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural network programming relies on indirect learning algorithms that lack discrete structure, making it impossible to compile most algorithms into neural networks due to differentiability issues.

Method: Introduce Cajal - a typed, higher-order linear programming language that compiles programs to linear neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning.

Result: Cajal programs successfully compile to linear neurons that can be linked with other neural networks, enabling networks to learn faster, with greater data-efficiency, and improved debuggability.

Conclusion: Linear programming languages provide a path to directly program neural networks, enabling rich interplay between learning and discrete programming structures.

Abstract: We don't program neural networks directly. Instead, we rely on an indirect style where learning algorithms, like gradient descent, determine a neural network's function by learning from data. This indirect style is often a virtue; it empowers us to solve problems that were previously impossible. But it lacks discrete structure. We can't compile most algorithms into a neural network -- even if these algorithms could help the network learn. This limitation occurs because discrete algorithms are not obviously differentiable, making them incompatible with the gradient-based learning algorithms that determine a neural network's function. To address this, we introduce $\textsf{Cajal}$: a typed, higher-order and linear programming language intended to be a minimal vehicle for exploring a direct style of programming neural networks. We prove $\textsf{Cajal}$ programs compile to linear neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation of $\textsf{Cajal}$, we conduct several experiments where we link these linear neurons against other neural networks to determine part of their function prior to learning. Linking with these neurons allows networks to learn faster, with greater data-efficiency, and in a way that's easier to debug. A key lesson is that linear programming languages provide a path towards directly programming neural networks, enabling a rich interplay between learning and the discrete structures of ordinary programming.

TL;DR: This paper explores SSL representation transferability and proposes TC² method to address task conflict issues, improving transfer performance across downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the transferability of self-supervised learning representations between different tasks, addressing limitations in current SSL approaches where task conflicts hinder effective transfer.

Method: Proposes Task Conflict Calibration (TC²) method using meta-learning paradigm: splits batches into multiple SSL tasks, uses factor extraction network for causal generative factors, weight extraction network for sample-specific weights, and employs two-stage bi-level optimization with data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity constraints.

Result: Experimental results on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate consistent improvement in SSL model transferability compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed TC² method effectively addresses task conflict issues in SSL transferability and significantly enhances the ability of learned representations to transfer across different tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the transferability of SSL by addressing two central questions: (i) what is the representation transferability of SSL, and (ii) how can we effectively model this transferability? Transferability is defined as the ability of a representation learned from one task to support the objective of another.
  Inspired by the meta-learning paradigm, we construct multiple SSL tasks within each training batch to support explicitly modeling transferability. Based on empirical evidence and causal analysis, we find that although introducing task-level information improves transferability, it is still hindered by task conflict. To address this issue, we propose a Task Conflict Calibration (TC$^2$) method to alleviate the impact of task conflict. Specifically, it first splits batches to create multiple SSL tasks, infusing task-level information. Next, it uses a factor extraction network to produce causal generative factors for all tasks and a weight extraction network to assign dedicated weights to each sample, employing data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity to ensure effectiveness. Finally, TC$^2$ calibrates sample representations during SSL training and integrates into the pipeline via a two-stage bi-level optimization framework to boost the transferability of learned representations. Experimental results on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our method consistently improves the transferability of SSL models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Larger language models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones, with harm likelihood increasing with attacker-to-target size ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how LLM vulnerabilities scale in multi-agent adversarial settings and whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller aligned models.

Method: Simulated over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across LLM families (0.6B-120B parameters) using JailbreakBench tasks, with harm and refusal scores evaluated by three independent LLM judges.

Result: Strong correlation between mean harm and logarithm of attacker-to-target size ratio (r=0.51), higher variance in attacker behavior than target susceptibility, and strong negative correlation between attacker refusal frequency and harm (rho=-0.93).

Conclusion: Size asymmetry influences adversarial robustness, with larger models posing greater jailbreak threats to smaller ones, motivating further investigation into inter-model alignment and safety.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in multi-agent and safety-critical settings, raising open questions about how their vulnerabilities scale when models interact adversarially. This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post hoc explanation methods are disconnected from model training, limiting their faithfulness and utility for transparent and trustworthy AI systems.

Method: Introduces ScoresActivation function - a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline that enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable, end-to-end trainable manner.

Result: Yields globally faithful feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth, 150x faster than SHAP (2s vs 300s), improves classification accuracy by 11.24-29.33%, and demonstrates robustness to irrelevant inputs.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between model accuracy and interpretability, offering a scalable framework for inherently explainable machine learning.

Abstract: Understanding the decision of large deep learning models is a critical challenge for building transparent and trustworthy systems. Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance. Moreover, feature scoring is 150 times faster than the classical SHAP method, requiring only 2 seconds during training compared to SHAP's 300 seconds for feature ranking in the same configuration. Our method also improves classification accuracy by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant), demonstrating robustness to irrelevant inputs. This work bridges the gap between model accuracy and interpretability, offering a scalable framework for inherently explainable machine learning.

*Zelei Shao,Vikranth Srivatsa,Sanjana Srivastava,Qingyang Wu,Alpay Ariyak,Xiaoxia Wu,Ameen Patel,Jue Wang,Percy Liang,Tri Dao,Ce Zhang,Yiying Zhang,Ben Athiwaratkun,Chenfeng Xu,Junxiong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAS is a distribution-aware speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL post-training rollouts by using historical rollout patterns to generate draft tokens more efficiently, reducing rollout time by up to 50% without changing model outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL post-training efficiency is constrained by the rollout phase where long trajectories dominate wall clock time due to long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, while historical rollouts reveal stable prompt-level patterns that can be exploited.

Method: DAS integrates an adaptive nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length-aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan.

Result: Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks show DAS reduces rollout time up to 50% while preserving identical training curves.

Conclusion: Distribution-aware speculative decoding can significantly accelerate RL post-training without compromising learning quality by exploiting rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing decoding costs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning(RL) post-training has become essential for aligning large language models (LLMs), yet its efficiency is increasingly constrained by the rollout phase, where long trajectories are generated token by token. We identify a major bottleneck:the long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, where a small fraction of long generations dominates wall clock time and a complementary opportunity; the availability of historical rollouts that reveal stable prompt level patterns across training epochs. Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks show that DAS reduces rollout time up to 50% while preserving identical training curves, demonstrating that distribution-aware speculative decoding can significantly accelerate RL post training without compromising learning quality.

*Saleh Momeni,Changnan Xiao,Bing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AnaCP enables efficient class-incremental learning by combining analytic classifiers with incremental feature adaptation, achieving joint training performance without gradient-based updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CIL methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, and while PTM-based approaches improve efficiency, they fail to adapt features incrementally, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes Analytic Contrastive Projection (AnaCP) that preserves analytic classifier efficiency while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training.

Result: AnaCP outperforms existing baselines and achieves the accuracy level of joint training, which is considered the upper bound of CIL.

Conclusion: AnaCP successfully addresses the feature adaptation limitation in PTM-based CIL while maintaining efficiency and avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of class-incremental learning (CIL), a core setting within continual learning where a model learns a sequence of tasks, each containing a distinct set of classes. Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates. Our experiments show that AnaCP not only outperforms existing baselines but also achieves the accuracy level of joint training, which is regarded as the upper bound of CIL.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) like sum-product networks for power utility investment planning to handle decade-long uncertainty forecasts, enabling exact inference and robust decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical scenario-based approaches for power utility investment planning are limited in handling profound uncertainty over decades, restricting insight into volatility and hindering robust decision-making.

Method: Uses tractable probabilistic models (TPMs), particularly sum-product networks (SPNs), to enable exact and scalable inference of scenario likelihoods, marginals, and conditional probabilities for robust scenario expansion and risk assessment.

Result: The framework allows direct embedding of chance-constrained optimization into investment planning, enabling safety enforcement with prescribed confidence levels and compact representation of high-dimensional uncertainties.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates computational and reliability advantages over traditional scenario-based models through a representative power system planning case study.

Abstract: Investment planning in power utilities, such as generation and transmission expansion, requires decade-long forecasts under profound uncertainty. Forecasting of energy mix and energy use decades ahead is nontrivial. Classical approaches focus on generating a finite number of scenarios (modeled as a mixture of Diracs in statistical theory terms), which limits insight into scenario-specific volatility and hinders robust decision-making. We propose an alternative using tractable probabilistic models (TPMs), particularly sum-product networks (SPNs). These models enable exact, scalable inference of key quantities such as scenario likelihoods, marginals, and conditional probabilities, supporting robust scenario expansion and risk assessment.
  This framework enables direct embedding of chance-constrained optimization into investment planning, enforcing safety or reliability with prescribed confidence levels. TPMs allow both scenario analysis and volatility quantification by compactly representing high-dimensional uncertainties. We demonstrate the approach's effectiveness through a representative power system planning case study, illustrating computational and reliability advantages over traditional scenario-based models.

TL;DR: MargNet combines statistical model designs with neural networks for differentially private tabular data synthesis, achieving better performance on densely correlated datasets while maintaining utility on sparse datasets with faster speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing neural network methods in differentially private tabular data synthesis, particularly for densely correlated datasets where statistical models struggle with complex dependencies.

Method: Proposes MargNet which incorporates adaptive marginal selection strategy from statistical models into neural networks, training networks to generate data that conforms to selected marginals.

Result: On sparsely correlated datasets: achieves utility close to best statistical methods with 7x speedup. On densely correlated datasets: establishes new state-of-the-art, reducing fidelity error by up to 26% compared to previous best methods.

Conclusion: MargNet successfully bridges the gap between statistical and neural network approaches, demonstrating superior performance on complex datasets while maintaining efficiency on simpler datasets.

Abstract: In differentially private (DP) tabular data synthesis, the consensus is that statistical models are better than neural network (NN)-based methods. However, we argue that this conclusion is incomplete and overlooks the challenge of densely correlated datasets, where intricate dependencies can overwhelm statistical models. In such complex scenarios, neural networks are more suitable due to their capacity to fit complex distributions by learning directly from samples. Despite this potential, existing NN-based algorithms still suffer from significant limitations. We therefore propose MargNet, incorporating successful algorithmic designs of statistical models into neural networks. MargNet applies an adaptive marginal selection strategy and trains the neural networks to generate data that conforms to the selected marginals. On sparsely correlated datasets, our approach achieves utility close to the best statistical method while offering an average 7$\times$ speedup over it. More importantly, on densely correlated datasets, MargNet establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing fidelity error by up to 26\% compared to the previous best. We release our code on GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/KaiChen9909/margnet}

TL;DR: A novel GNN framework using complex-weighted edges to enhance expressiveness and address oversmoothing and heterophilic graph limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome GNN limitations like oversmoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs by introducing complex-weighted diffusion processes.

Method: Proposed Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN) that assigns complex numbers to edges to drive diffusion in complex domain, with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations.

Result: CWCN achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets without additional hyperparameters beyond standard GNNs.

Conclusion: Complex-weighted diffusion provides a principled mechanism for enhancing GNN expressiveness, enabling theoretically grounded and practically effective models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications, yet they remain limited by oversmoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that equips graphs with a complex-weighted structure, assigning each edge a complex number to drive a diffusion process that extends random walks into the complex domain. We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that complex-weighted diffusion provides a principled and general mechanism for enhancing GNN expressiveness, opening new avenues for models that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tuning bootstrap rate (BR) in Random Forests significantly improves performance over default BR=1.0, with optimal BR depending on dataset characteristics - higher BR for strong global relationships, lower BR for high local variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random Forests typically use fixed bootstrap rate (BR) of 1.0, but the impact of varying BR on performance across different dataset types is not well understood.

Method: Systematically examined BR from 0.2 to 5.0 across 39 regression datasets and 16 RF configurations using repeated two-fold cross-validation with MSE evaluation, plus synthetic dataset experiments with controlled noise.

Result: BR tuning yields significant improvements: BR≤1.0 optimal for 24 datasets, BR>1.0 for 15 datasets, BR=1.0 optimal in only 4 cases. Dataset characteristics predict preferred BR - strong global relationships favor higher BR, high local variance favors lower BR.

Conclusion: Bootstrap rate is an influential hyperparameter that should be tuned for optimal RF regression performance, with choice depending on dataset noise characteristics through bias-variance trade-off.

Abstract: Random Forests (RFs) typically train each tree on a bootstrap sample of the same size as the training set, i.e., bootstrap rate (BR) equals 1.0. We systematically examine how varying BR from 0.2 to 5.0 affects RF performance across 39 heterogeneous regression datasets and 16 RF configurations, evaluating with repeated two-fold cross-validation and mean squared error. Our results demonstrate that tuning the BR can yield significant improvements over the default: the best setup relied on BR \leq 1.0 for 24 datasets, BR > 1.0 for 15, and BR = 1.0 was optimal in 4 cases only. We establish a link between dataset characteristics and the preferred BR: datasets with strong global feature-target relationships favor higher BRs, while those with higher local target variance benefit from lower BRs. To further investigate this relationship, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels. These experiments reproduce the observed bias-variance trade-off: in low-noise scenarios, higher BRs effectively reduce model bias, whereas in high-noise settings, lower BRs help reduce model variance. Overall, BR is an influential hyperparameter that should be tuned to optimize RF regression models.

Motivation: To address the challenge of training stochastic neural networks for reconstructing multidimensional random field models with limited training data, particularly dealing with the curse of dimensionality and heterogeneous noise across dimensions.

Method: Improved Wasserstein-distance approach for training stochastic neural networks, with theoretical analysis of generalization error bounds and numerical experiments on multidimensional uncertainty quantification tasks.

Result: Proved generalization error bounds showing convergence rate may not explicitly depend on model dimensionality when noise is heterogeneous, partially alleviating the curse of dimensionality. Demonstrated successful training of SNNs for multidimensional uncertainty models through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The Wasserstein-distance approach can effectively train stochastic neural networks for multidimensional random field reconstruction, with improved scalability and robustness, partially overcoming dimensionality challenges in learning from finite data.

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the scalability of a recent Wasserstein-distance approach for training stochastic neural networks (SNNs) to reconstruct multidimensional random field models. We prove a generalization error bound for reconstructing multidimensional random field models on training stochastic neural networks with a limited number of training data. Our results indicate that when noise is heterogeneous across dimensions, the convergence rate of the generalization error may not depend explicitly on the model's dimensionality, partially alleviating the "curse of dimensionality" for learning multidimensional random field models from a finite number of data points. Additionally, we improve the previous Wasserstein-distance SNN training approach and showcase the robustness of the SNN. Through numerical experiments on different multidimensional uncertainty quantification tasks, we show that our Wasserstein-distance approach can successfully train stochastic neural networks to learn multidimensional uncertainty models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PCA Whitening improves sparse autoencoder performance by transforming the optimization landscape, enhancing interpretability metrics despite minor reconstruction quality drops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse autoencoders face challenging optimization landscapes due to input data correlations, and whitening - a classical sparse coding technique - may address this issue.

Method: Apply PCA Whitening to input activations before training SAEs, evaluate ReLU and Top-K SAEs across various model architectures, widths, and sparsity regimes using SAEBench benchmark.

Result: Whitening consistently improves interpretability metrics (sparse probing accuracy, feature disentanglement) while slightly reducing reconstruction quality, challenging the sparsity-fidelity trade-off assumption.

Conclusion: Whitening should be a default preprocessing step for SAE training when prioritizing interpretability over perfect reconstruction.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning interpretable features from neural network activations. However, the optimization landscape for SAE training can be challenging due to correlations in the input data. We demonstrate that applying PCA Whitening to input activations -- a standard preprocessing technique in classical sparse coding -- improves SAE performance across multiple metrics. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that whitening transforms the optimization landscape, making it more convex and easier to navigate. We evaluate both ReLU and Top-K SAEs across diverse model architectures, widths, and sparsity regimes. Empirical evaluation on SAEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for sparse autoencoders, reveals that whitening consistently improves interpretability metrics, including sparse probing accuracy and feature disentanglement, despite minor drops in reconstruction quality. Our results challenge the assumption that interpretability aligns with an optimal sparsity--fidelity trade-off and suggest that whitening should be considered as a default preprocessing step for SAE training, particularly when interpretability is prioritized over perfect reconstruction.

TL;DR: A framework for detecting errors in LLM-generated SQL by estimating uncertainty at individual AST nodes using schema-aware features and supervised classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide fine-grained error detection in LLM-generated SQL queries by moving beyond aggregate sequence-level confidence measures to pinpoint exactly where queries are wrong.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Semantically aware labeling algorithm for node-level correctness assessment, 2) Training supervised classifier with schema-aware features (identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, scope ambiguity, typo signals) to predict per-node error probabilities.

Result: Substantially outperforms token log-probabilities with +27.44% average AUC improvement across multiple databases and datasets, maintaining robustness in cross-database evaluation.

Conclusion: Node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation provides strong and interpretable alternative to aggregate sequence-level confidence measures, supporting targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and selective execution.

Abstract: We present a practical framework for detecting errors in LLM-generated SQL by estimating uncertainty at the level of individual nodes in the query's abstract syntax tree (AST). Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation. Beyond serving as an accuracy signal, node-level uncertainty supports targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and downstream selective execution. Together, these results establish node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation as a strong and interpretable alternative to aggregate sequence level confidence measures.

*Michael Menart,Aleksandar Nikolov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lower bounds on runtime for differentially private convex optimization show dimension-dependent penalties, with tight results for non-smooth and smooth losses under various oracle settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental computational costs of differentially private optimization and establish lower bounds on oracle query complexity for achieving optimal excess risk.

Method: Theoretical analysis establishing lower bounds on first-order oracle queries for differentially private empirical/population risk minimization, considering non-smooth and smooth Lipschitz convex losses under different oracle models.

Result: Proved tight lower bounds: Ω(min{√d/α², d/log(1/α)}) for non-smooth losses with private proxy oracles, and Ω̃(√d/α + min{1/α², n}) for smooth losses with private optimizers. Also showed limitations for information-limited oracles.

Conclusion: Differentially private optimization incurs dimension-dependent runtime penalties, and gradient quantization techniques face fundamental limitations due to information constraints.

Abstract: We study the running time, in terms of first order oracle queries, of differentially private empirical/population risk minimization of Lipschitz convex losses. We first consider the setting where the loss is non-smooth and the optimizer interacts with a private proxy oracle, which sends only private messages about a minibatch of gradients. In this setting, we show that expected running time $Ω(\min\{\frac{\sqrt{d}}{α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\})$ is necessary to achieve $α$ excess risk on problems of dimension $d$ when $d \geq 1/α^2$. Upper bounds via DP-SGD show these results are tight when $d>\tildeΩ(1/α^4)$. We further show our lower bound can be strengthened to $Ω(\min\{\frac{d}{\bar{m}α^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)} \})$ for algorithms which use minibatches of size at most $\bar{m} < \sqrt{d}$. We next consider smooth losses, where we relax the private oracle assumption and give lower bounds under only the condition that the optimizer is private. Here, we lower bound the expected number of first order oracle calls by $\tildeΩ\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}α + \min\{\frac{1}{α^2}, n\}\big)$, where $n$ is the size of the dataset. Modifications to existing algorithms show this bound is nearly tight. Compared to non-private lower bounds, our results show that differentially private optimizers pay a dimension dependent runtime penalty. Finally, as a natural extension of our proof technique, we show lower bounds in the non-smooth setting for optimizers interacting with information limited oracles. Specifically, if the proxy oracle transmits at most $Γ$-bits of information about the gradients in the minibatch, then $Ω\big(\min\{\frac{d}{α^2Γ}, \frac{d}{\log(1/α)}\}\big)$ oracle calls are needed. This result shows fundamental limitations of gradient quantization techniques in optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method using tractable probabilistic circuits to improve Bayesian network structure learning by enabling fast exact marginalization without parent set restrictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian structure learning faces challenges in marginalizing over probability distributions, typically requiring dynamic programming methods that restrict possible parent sets for each node.

Method: Utilizes tractable probabilistic circuits with a new learning routine that trains circuits on both original distribution and marginal queries, enabling fast exact marginalization.

Result: Empirical results show that using this method to answer marginals allows Bayesian structure learners to improve performance compared to current methods.

Conclusion: Probabilistic circuits provide an effective alternative to traditional dynamic programming approaches for Bayesian structure learning, enabling better performance through unrestricted marginalization capabilities.

Abstract: Bayesian networks (BNs) are a widely used class of probabilistic graphical models employed in numerous application domains. However, inferring the network's graphical structure from data remains challenging. Bayesian structure learners approach this problem by inferring a posterior distribution over the possible directed acyclic graphs underlying the BN. The inference process often requires marginalizing over probability distributions, which is typically done using dynamic programming methods that restrict the set of possible parents for each node. Instead, we present a novel method that utilizes tractable probabilistic circuits to circumvent this restriction. This method utilizes a new learning routine that trains these circuits on both the original distribution and marginal queries. The architecture of probabilistic circuits then inherently allows for fast and exact marginalization on the learned distribution. We then show empirically that utilizing our method to answer marginals allows Bayesian structure learners to improve their performance compared to current methods.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates how to craft imperceptible adversarial perturbations that not only misclassify inputs but also spoof certified robustness guarantees, making models issue deceptive large robustness radii for incorrect classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks and understand the limits of robustness guarantee provisions, particularly whether small perturbations can both cause misclassification and generate deceptive certificates.

Method: The authors explore region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations that spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates, evaluated extensively on ImageNet.

Result: The method effectively bypasses state-of-the-art certified defenses like Densepure, demonstrating the vulnerability of current certification frameworks to certificate spoofing attacks.

Conclusion: The work underscores the need to better understand the limits of robustness certification methods and highlights critical vulnerabilities in current certified defense approaches.

Abstract: Certified defenses promise provable robustness guarantees. We study the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks to better understand the limits of guarantee provisions. Now, the objective is to not only mislead a classifier, but also manipulate the certification process to generate a robustness guarantee for an adversarial input certificate spoofing. A recent study in ICLR demonstrated that crafting large perturbations can shift inputs far into regions capable of generating a certificate for an incorrect class. Our study investigates if perturbations needed to cause a misclassification and yet coax a certified model into issuing a deceptive, large robustness radius for a target class can still be made small and imperceptible. We explore the idea of region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations, spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates. Extensive evaluations with the ImageNet demonstrate the ability to effectively bypass state-of-the-art certified defenses such as Densepure. Our work underscores the need to better understand the limits of robustness certification methods.

TL;DR: Narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains can trigger emergent misalignment (EMA), causing models to generate harmful responses in unrelated domains. Safety concept unlearning has larger EMA impact than Cybersecurity, and cross-entropy loss on retain data can restore alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how narrow domain unlearning induces emergent misalignment across unrelated responsible AI domains, and investigate the underlying causes through concept entanglement analysis.

Method: Performed refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concepts, monitored refusal scores across 7 RAI domains, analyzed EMA using two model families, and investigated concept entanglements via representation-level concept vectors.

Result: Safety concept unlearning caused larger EMA impact across unrelated domains like bias. EMA was consistent across Mistral-7b-0.3v and Qwen-7b-2.5 models. Cross-entropy loss on retain data largely restored alignment while maintaining low refusal rates on targeted concepts.

Conclusion: Narrow domain unlearning can propagate emergent misalignment to unrelated domains, with concepts having higher representation similarity being more susceptible. Cross-entropy augmentation helps mitigate EMA while preserving targeted unlearning effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning on insecure code data can trigger an emergent misalignment (EMA) phenomenon, where models generate malicious responses even to prompts unrelated to the original insecure code-writing task. Such cross-domain generalization of harmful behavior underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the algorithms, tasks, and datasets that induce emergent misalignment. In this work, we extend this study by demonstrating that emergent misalignment can also arise from narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains. We perform refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concept, and evaluate EMA by monitoring refusal scores across seven responsible AI (RAI) domains, Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, and Privacy. Our work shows that narrow domain unlearning can yield compliance responses for the targeted concept, however, it may also propagate EMA to unrelated domains. Among the two intervened concepts, Cybersecurity and Safety, we find that the safety concept can have larger EMA impact, i.e, causing lower refusal scores, across other unrelated domains such as bias. We observe this effect consistently across two model families, Mistral-7b-0.3v, and Qwen-7b-2.5. Further, we show that refusal unlearning augmented with cross-entropy loss function on a small set of retain data from the affected domains can largely, if not fully, restore alignment across the impacted domains while having lower refusal rate on the concept we perform unlearning on. To investigate the underlying causes of EMA, we analyze concept entanglements at the representation level via concept vectors. Our analysis reveals that concepts with higher representation similarity in earlier layers are more susceptible to EMA after intervention when the refusal stream is altered through targeted refusal unlearning.

Abstract: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent 99.9% of U.S. businesses yet remain systematically excluded from AI due to a mismatch between their operational scale and modern machine learning's data requirements. This paper introduces SmallML, a Bayesian transfer learning framework achieving enterprise-level prediction accuracy with datasets as small as 50-200 observations.
  We develop a three-layer architecture integrating transfer learning, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, and conformal prediction. Layer 1 extracts informative priors from 22,673 public records using a SHAP-based procedure transferring knowledge from gradient boosting to logistic regression. Layer 2 implements hierarchical pooling across J=5-50 SMEs with adaptive shrinkage, balancing population patterns with entity-specific characteristics. Layer 3 provides conformal sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees P(y in C(x)) >= 1-alpha for distribution-free uncertainty quantification.
  Validation on customer churn data demonstrates 96.7% +/- 4.2% AUC with 100 observations per business -- a +24.2 point improvement over independent logistic regression (72.5% +/- 8.1%), with p < 0.000001. Conformal prediction achieves 92% empirical coverage at 90% target. Training completes in 33 minutes on standard CPU hardware. By enabling enterprise-grade predictions for 33 million U.S. SMEs previously excluded from machine learning, SmallML addresses a critical gap in AI democratization.

TL;DR: A machine learning framework using wrist-worn sensors for simultaneous archery motion recognition (96.8% accuracy) and stress estimation (80% accuracy) to provide real-time feedback for precision sports training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional motion analysis systems are expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments for precision sports like archery where both biomechanical stability and psychological resilience are crucial.

Method: Developed a multimodal framework using a wrist-worn device with accelerometer and PPG sensors. Used LSTM with novel SmoothDiff feature for motion recognition, and MLP with HRV features from PPG for stress estimation.

Result: Achieved 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score for motion phase recognition, and 80% accuracy for distinguishing high- and low-stress levels.

Conclusion: The integrated motion and physiological sensing framework provides meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states, offering a foundation for intelligent real-time feedback systems in precision sports.

Abstract: In precision sports such as archery, athletes' performance depends on both biomechanical stability and psychological resilience. Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states. This approach offers a foundation for developing intelligent, real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports.

*Kelin Ren,Chan-Yang Ju,Dong-Ho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CafeMed is a medication recommendation framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention to address limitations of existing approaches in modeling synergistic effects and adapting to patient-specific contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medication recommendation systems fail to model synergistic effects between medical entities and use static causal relationships that don't adapt to individual patient states and health contexts.

Method: Proposes CafeMed with two key components: Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on patient states, and Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures.

Result: Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets show CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with superior accuracy in medication prediction and lower drug-drug interaction rates.

Conclusion: Incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations.

Abstract: Medication recommendation systems play a crucial role in assisting clinicians with personalized treatment decisions. While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations.

*Nakkyu Yang,Yechan Lee,SooJean Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CFG-EC is a correction scheme that refines unconditional noise predictions in Classifier-Free Guidance to reduce inconsistency between training and sampling processes, improving prompt fidelity and generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG has inconsistent noise estimates between training and sampling because it outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously during sampling, unlike the alternating approach used during training.

Method: CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component, preventing interference between guidance components and constraining sampling error bounds.

Result: CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering better performance in low guidance sampling and consistently higher prompt alignment across all scenarios.

Conclusion: CFG-EC provides a versatile correction scheme that can be augmented to any CFG-based method, establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation.

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become a mainstream approach for simultaneously improving prompt fidelity and generation quality in conditional generative models. During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation. Our numerical experiments show that CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering a marked performance increase in the low guidance sampling regime and consistently higher prompt alignment across the board.

*Qiqi Xiao,Ziqi Ye,Yinghui He,Jianwei Liu,Guanding Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Meta-SimGNN is a WiFi localization system that combines graph neural networks with meta-learning to handle device configuration changes (bandwidth, AP count, antennas) and environmental variations, improving localization generalization and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing meta-learning localization methods focus on environmental layout changes but ignore device configuration variations (bandwidth, AP count, antennas) that affect CSI dimensionality and compromise neural network usability.

Method: Uses fine-grained CSI graph construction with APs as nodes, amplitude-phase fusion for CSI images, dimension-consistent feature extraction, and similarity-guided meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments on commodity WiFi devices show Meta-SimGNN outperforms baseline methods in localization generalization and accuracy across different scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively addresses both environmental and device configuration variations, demonstrating superior performance in WiFi localization generalization and robustness.

Abstract: To promote the practicality of deep learning-based localization, existing studies aim to address the issue of scenario dependence through meta-learning. However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario. Extensive experimental results over commodity WiFi devices in different scenarios show that Meta-SimGNN outperforms the baseline methods in terms of localization generalization and accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Observational DP auditing framework that evaluates privacy without modifying training data, using inherent data randomness instead of canaries or data removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DP auditing methods require modifying training datasets (e.g., injecting canaries, removing samples), which is resource-intensive and impractical for large-scale systems.

Method: Leverages inherent randomness in data distributions to evaluate privacy without altering original datasets, extending auditing beyond membership inference to protected attributes including labels.

Result: Experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: Provides practical privacy auditing solution for large-scale production environments without the engineering overhead of traditional methods.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing is essential for evaluating privacy guarantees in machine learning systems. Existing auditing methods, however, pose a significant challenge for large-scale systems since they require modifying the training dataset -- for instance, by injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples from training. Such interventions on the training data pipeline are resource-intensive and involve considerable engineering overhead. We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset. Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques. We provide theoretical foundations for our method and perform experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets that demonstrate its effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees. This work opens new avenues for practical privacy auditing in large-scale production environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE-SpeQ overcomes I/O bottlenecks in MoE model inference by using speculative execution to prefetch experts, achieving 2.34x speedup over state-of-the-art offloading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the severe I/O bottleneck caused by expert offloading in Mixture-of-Experts models, where synchronous PCIe transfers cripple performance due to data-dependent expert selection.

Method: Uses speculative execution with a small on-device draft model to predict future expert requirements, enabling prefetching and overlapping I/O with computation. Includes adaptive governor guided by Amortization Roofline Model to dynamically tune speculation strategy.

Result: Achieves up to 2.34x speedup over state-of-the-art offloading framework for Phi-MoE model on memory-constrained devices.

Conclusion: Establishes a principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware.

Abstract: The immense memory requirements of state-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models present a significant challenge for inference, often exceeding the capacity of a single accelerator. While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.
  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework. Our work establishes a new, principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware.

*Agamdeep Singh,Ashish Tiwari,Hosein Hasanbeig,Priyanshu Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Soft-label training treats annotation distributions as ground truth instead of collapsing them into single labels, better preserving epistemic uncertainty in ambiguous data while matching hard-label accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard practice collapses diverse human annotations into single labels, forcing models to express false confidence on ambiguous cases and creating misalignment between model certainty and human perception diversity.

Method: Soft-label training that treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserving the epistemic uncertainty inherent in human annotations rather than aggregating them away.

Result: Across vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations, 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching hard-label training accuracy.

Conclusion: Annotation distributions should be repositioned from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce.

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks involve inherent subjectivity, where annotators naturally provide varied labels. Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training. Our work repositions annotation distributions from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce.

TL;DR: Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) estimates counterfactual hazard trajectories for time-to-event outcomes using observational panel data with heterogeneous treatments and confounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in causal survival analysis including censoring, limited samples, and non-random treatment assignment to answer 'when-if' questions about event timing under interventions.

Method: Proposes SSC framework that estimates counterfactual hazard trajectories as weighted combinations of observed trajectories from other units in panel data, leveraging low-rank structure from classical survival models.

Result: Established identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. Applied to multi-country cancer treatment data, showing novel therapies associated with improved survival through lower post-intervention hazard trajectories.

Conclusion: SSC provides a general, interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference across medicine, economics, and public policy using observational data with formal theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects on time-to-event outcomes from observational data is particularly challenging due to censoring, limited sample sizes, and non-random treatment assignment. The need for answering such "when-if" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts. Given the broad relevance of survival analysis across medicine, economics, and public policy, our framework offers a general and interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference using observational data.

*Promise Ekpo,Saesha Agarwal,Felix Grimm,Lekan Molu,Angelique Taylor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fair-GNE is a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that enforces certifiable fairness in healthcare worker allocation by modeling the problem as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium game, achieving significant workload balance improvements while maintaining high task success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL approaches lack certifiable self-enforceable fairness that cannot be manipulated by individual agents at runtime, especially in healthcare settings where fair workload allocation among workers is crucial for reliable performance.

Method: Models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game where agents share resources and individual actions affect others, steering group policy to safe and locally efficient equilibrium where no agent can unilaterally improve its utility.

Result: Achieved significant improvement in workload balance (0.89 vs. 0.33 JFI, p < 0.01) over fixed-penalty baselines while maintaining 86% task success rate in high-fidelity resuscitation simulations.

Conclusion: Fair-GNE demonstrates statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement, providing principled fairness in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clear equilibrium-seeking innovations.

Abstract: Enforcing a fair workload allocation among multiple agents tasked to achieve an objective in learning enabled demand side healthcare worker settings is crucial for consistent and reliable performance at runtime. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement. Our results communicate our formulations, evaluation metrics, and equilibrium-seeking innovations in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clarity and principled fairness enforcement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs inherit biases from training data that can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation, making bias identification and mitigation crucial for fair AI outputs.

Method: Used bias-specific benchmarks (StereoSet, CrowSPairs) to evaluate multiple models; proposed automated Bias-Identification Framework with two-pronged approach for explicit/implicit bias detection; employed Bag-of-Words analysis; applied fine-tuning with prompting techniques and data augmentation.

Result: Fine-tuned models struggled with gender biases but excelled at identifying racial biases; LLMs often over-relied on keywords; enhancement strategy achieved up to 20% performance gains on implicit bias benchmarks; models showed promising cross-dataset adaptability.

Conclusion: Despite some success, LLMs exhibit significant biases requiring systematic detection and mitigation approaches; fine-tuning with data augmentation and prompting effectively enhances bias detection capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit explicit and implicit biases from their training datasets. Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial to ensure fair outputs, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. The fine-tuned models exhibited promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.

TL;DR: CSGU is a certified unlearning method for signed graphs that preserves sociological principles while providing privacy guarantees, outperforming existing methods in utility and unlearning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph unlearning methods are designed for conventional GNNs and fail to handle the unique heterogeneous properties of signed graphs, losing critical sign information and degrading model performance when applied to SGNNs.

Method: Three-stage approach: (1) identify minimal influenced neighborhoods via triangular structures, (2) apply sociological theories to quantify node importance for privacy budget allocation, (3) perform importance-weighted parameter updates for certified modifications.

Result: Extensive experiments show CSGU outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in both utility preservation and unlearning effectiveness on SGNNs.

Conclusion: CSGU successfully addresses the challenges of signed graph unlearning by incorporating sociological principles and providing provable privacy guarantees while maintaining model utility.

Abstract: Signed graphs model complex relationships through positive and negative edges, with widespread real-world applications. Given the sensitive nature of such data, selective removal mechanisms have become essential for privacy protection. While graph unlearning enables the removal of specific data influences from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), existing methods are designed for conventional GNNs and overlook the unique heterogeneous properties of signed graphs. When applied to Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), these methods lose critical sign information, degrading both model utility and unlearning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU), which provides provable privacy guarantees while preserving the sociological principles underlying SGNNs. CSGU employs a three-stage method: (1) efficiently identifying minimal influenced neighborhoods via triangular structures, (2) applying sociological theories to quantify node importance for optimal privacy budget allocation, and (3) performing importance-weighted parameter updates to achieve certified modifications with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSGU outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in both utility preservation and unlearning effectiveness on SGNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current red teaming methods are costly and slow due to online generation and black-box analysis, making them unsuitable for agile diagnostics after training new models.

Method: Analyzes hidden layer dynamics using Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory (APT) of latent representations and introduces Jensen-Shannon Separability (JSS) metric to evaluate safety without text generation.

Result: JSS metric shows high consistency with safety rankings from red teaming, reproducing discriminative trends at less than 1% of token and runtime costs across 40+ models and 20+ strategies.

Conclusion: N-GLARE provides an efficient, output-free evaluation proxy for real-time LLM safety diagnostics, enabling rapid assessment without expensive text generation.

Abstract: Evaluating the safety robustness of LLMs is critical for their deployment. However, mainstream Red Teaming methods rely on online generation and black-box output analysis. These approaches are not only costly but also suffer from feedback latency, making them unsuitable for agile diagnostics after training a new model. To address this, we propose N-GLARE (A Non-Generative, Latent Representation-Efficient LLM Safety Evaluator). N-GLARE operates entirely on the model's latent representations, bypassing the need for full text generation. It characterizes hidden layer dynamics by analyzing the APT (Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory) of latent representations and introducing the JSS (Jensen-Shannon Separability) metric. Experiments on over 40 models and 20 red teaming strategies demonstrate that the JSS metric exhibits high consistency with the safety rankings derived from Red Teaming. N-GLARE reproduces the discriminative trends of large-scale red-teaming tests at less than 1\% of the token cost and the runtime cost, providing an efficient output-free evaluation proxy for real-time diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ensemble prediction systems are computationally intensive, while recent Bayesian Deep Learning methods offer promising alternatives but remain disconnected from ensemble approaches. The paper aims to bridge these paradigms.

Method: Proposes a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework using variational inference for epistemic uncertainty and physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme for aleatoric uncertainty, modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics.

Result: Validated on 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset, the method improves forecast accuracy, yields better-calibrated uncertainty quantification, and achieves superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic diffusion models.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges ensemble prediction and Bayesian Deep Learning, providing a unified theoretical foundation for uncertainty decomposition in weather forecasting with improved performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is fundamentally challenged by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, necessitating probabilistic approaches to quantify uncertainty. While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25° spatial resolution. Experimental results show that our method not only improves forecast accuracy and yields better-calibrated uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic diffusion models. We commit to making our code open-source upon acceptance of this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMC methods are easier to parallelize than MCTS but suffer from high variance and path degeneracy that limit their effectiveness with increased search depth.

Method: Introduces Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search (TSMCTS) which applies variance reduction techniques and addresses path degeneracy issues in SMC.

Result: TSMCTS outperforms both SMC baseline and modern MCTS across discrete and continuous environments, scaling better with sequential compute.

Conclusion: TSMCTS successfully combines the parallelization benefits of SMC with improved scaling through variance reduction and path degeneracy mitigation.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods that leverage search are responsible for many milestone breakthroughs in RL. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) recently emerged as an alternative to the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm which drove these breakthroughs. SMC is easier to parallelize and more suitable to GPU acceleration. However, it also suffers from large variance and path degeneracy which prevent it from scaling well with increased search depth, i.e., increased sequential compute. To address these problems, we introduce Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search (TSMCTS). Across discrete and continuous environments TSMCTS outperforms the SMC baseline as well as a popular modern version of MCTS. Through variance reduction and mitigation of path degeneracy, TSMCTS scales favorably with sequential compute while retaining the properties that make SMC natural to parallelize.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify space binding by focusing on core components (single encoder per modality and high-quality data) and enable efficient training of multimodal models without requiring massive computational resources.

Method: EBind uses a data-centric approach with three complementary data sources: 6.7M automated multimodal quintuples, 1M human-annotated triples, and 3.4M existing captioned data. It employs a single encoder per modality and parameter-efficient binding of contrastive model embedding spaces.

Result: A 1.8B-parameter model outperforms models 4-17x larger across 13 different evaluations. The method enables training on a single GPU in hours instead of multiple days.

Conclusion: Carefully curated high-quality data and parameter-efficient methods can achieve state-of-the-art multimodal performance with significantly reduced computational requirements, challenging the need for massive model scaling.

Abstract: We simplify space binding by focusing on two core components, a single encoder per modality and high-quality data; enabling training state-of-the-art models on a single GPU in a few hours as opposed to multiple days. We present EBind, an Easy, data-centric, and parameter-efficient method to Bind the embedding spaces of multiple contrastive models. We demonstrate that a simple 1.8B-parameter image-text-video-audio-3D model can outperform models 4 to 17x the size. The key to achieving this is a carefully curated dataset of three complementary data sources: i) 6.7M fully-automated multimodal quintuples sourced via SOTA retrieval models, ii) 1M diverse, semi-automated triples annotated by humans as negative, partial, or positive matches, and iii) 3.4M pre-existing captioned data items. We use 13 different evaluations to demonstrate the value of each data source. Due to limitations with existing benchmarks, we further introduce the first high-quality, consensus-annotated zero-shot classification benchmark between audio and PCs. In contrast to related work, we will open-source our code, model weights, and datasets.

*Yosuke Nishimoto,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STICA is a framework that uses object-centric Transformers as world models and causality-aware policy networks to improve sample efficiency and performance in reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional world models struggle with high-dimensional, non-stationary environments with multiple interacting objects, while humans decompose environments into discrete objects for efficient decision-making.

Method: Represents observations as object-centric tokens plus action and reward tokens, uses object-centric Transformers to predict token-level dynamics, and employs causality-aware policy/value networks that estimate token-level cause-effect relations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art agents in both sample efficiency and final performance on object-rich benchmarks.

Conclusion: Object-centric decomposition combined with causality-aware learning provides an effective approach for reinforcement learning in complex, multi-object environments.

Abstract: World models have been developed to support sample-efficient deep reinforcement learning agents. However, it remains challenging for world models to accurately replicate environments that are high-dimensional, non-stationary, and composed of multiple objects with rich interactions since most world models learn holistic representations of all environmental components. By contrast, humans perceive the environment by decomposing it into discrete objects, facilitating efficient decision-making. Motivated by this insight, we propose \emph{Slot Transformer Imagination with CAusality-aware reinforcement learning} (STICA), a unified framework in which object-centric Transformers serve as the world model and causality-aware policy and value networks. STICA represents each observation as a set of object-centric tokens, together with tokens for the agent action and the resulting reward, enabling the world model to predict token-level dynamics and interactions. The policy and value networks then estimate token-level cause--effect relations and use them in the attention layers, yielding causality-guided decision-making. Experiments on object-rich benchmarks demonstrate that STICA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agents in both sample efficiency and final performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by improving both prediction performance and explainability through explicit modeling of navigational intentions.

Abstract: Vessel trajectory prediction is fundamental to intelligent maritime systems. Within this domain, short-term prediction of rapid behavioral changes in complex maritime environments has established multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) as a promising research area. However, existing vessel MTP methods suffer from limited scenario applicability and insufficient explainability. To address these challenges, we propose a unified MTP framework incorporating explainable navigation intentions, which we classify into sustained and transient categories. Our method constructs sustained intention trees from historical trajectories and models dynamic transient intentions using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), while using a non-local attention mechanism to maintain global scenario consistency. Experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets demonstrates our method's broad applicability across diverse scenarios, achieving significant improvements in both ADE and FDE. Furthermore, our method improves explainability by explicitly revealing the navigational intentions underlying each predicted trajectory.

TL;DR: Tabular foundation models like TabPFN and TabICL are computationally expensive for representation learning, while simple classical feature engineering (TableVectorizer) achieves comparable or better performance and is much faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate task-agnostic representations from tabular foundation models compared to classical feature engineering methods, focusing on transferable embeddings rather than direct prediction.

Method: Systematic evaluation of task-agnostic representations from TabPFN and TabICL against classical TableVectorizer across outlier detection (ADBench) and supervised learning (TabArena Lite) tasks.

Result: Simple TableVectorizer features achieve comparable or superior performance while being up to three orders of magnitude faster than tabular foundation models.

Conclusion: Classical feature engineering methods provide efficient and effective alternatives to computationally expensive tabular foundation models for representation learning tasks.

Abstract: Recent foundation models for tabular data achieve strong task-specific performance via in-context learning. Nevertheless, they focus on direct prediction by encapsulating both representation learning and task-specific inference inside a single, resource-intensive network. This work specifically focuses on representation learning, i.e., on transferable, task-agnostic embeddings. We systematically evaluate task-agnostic representations from tabular foundation models (TabPFN and TabICL) alongside with classical feature engineering (TableVectorizer) across a variety of application tasks as outlier detection (ADBench) and supervised learning (TabArena Lite). We find that simple TableVectorizer features achieve comparable or superior performance while being up to three orders of magnitude faster than tabular foundation models.

### [220] [Weight Variance Amplifier Improves Accuracy in High-Sparsity One-Shot Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14282)
*Vincent-Daniel Yun,Junhyuk Jo,Sunwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) improves pruning robustness by increasing parameter variance during training, reducing accuracy drop after aggressive pruning without extra computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks have too many parameters for practical use, and existing pruning-robust optimizers like SAM and CrAM incur significant computational overhead while addressing accuracy drops from pruning.

Method: Proposed VAR regularizer that deliberately increases variance of model parameters during training, exploiting the finding that higher parameter variance leads to better pruning robustness.

Result: VAR demonstrates superior pruning robustness compared to existing methods, with theoretical convergence analysis and extensive empirical validation showing reduced accuracy drop after aggressive pruning.

Conclusion: VAR effectively mitigates pruning-induced accuracy degradation by promoting parameter variance, offering a computationally efficient alternative to existing pruning-robust optimization methods.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve outstanding performance in visual recognition tasks, yet their large number of parameters makes them less practical for real-world applications. Recently, one-shot pruning has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing model size without additional training. However, models trained with standard objective functions often suffer a significant drop in accuracy after aggressive pruning. Some existing pruning-robust optimizers, such as SAM, and CrAM, mitigate this accuracy drop by guiding the model toward flatter regions of the parameter space, but they inevitably incur non-negligible additional computations. We propose a Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) that deliberately increases the variance of model parameters during training. Our study reveals an intriguing finding that parameters with higher variance exhibit greater pruning robustness. VAR exploits this property by promoting such variance in the weight distribution, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of pruning. We further provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, supported by extensive empirical results demonstrating the superior pruning robustness of VAR.

### [222] [Intervention Efficiency and Perturbation Validation Framework: Capacity-Aware and Robust Clinical Model Selection under the Rashomon Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14317)
*Yuwen Zhang,Viet Tran,Paul Weng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the Rashomon Effect in clinical ML where multiple models have similar performance, making selection uncertain. It proposes Intervention Efficiency (IE) and Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF) for robust model assessment and selection that considers clinical utility and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical ML faces challenges with multiple equally performing models due to small, imbalanced datasets and noisy features. Conventional validation schemes are unreliable, and model selection becomes uncertain when resource constraints and operational priorities aren't considered by standard metrics.

Method: Proposes two complementary tools: 1) Intervention Efficiency (IE) - a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives under limited interventions, linking performance with clinical utility. 2) Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF) - assesses model stability under data perturbations to identify models with invariant performance across noisy/shifted validation sets.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using IE and PVF facilitates selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed tools offer a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings by enabling robust model assessment and selection that considers both clinical utility and stability under data perturbations.

Abstract: In clinical machine learning, the coexistence of multiple models with comparable performance -- a manifestation of the Rashomon Effect -- poses fundamental challenges for trustworthy deployment and evaluation. Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.

### [223] [Learning with Statistical Equality Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14320)
*Aneesh Barthakur,Luiz F. O. Chamon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of weighted penalty approaches for machine learning requirements by developing a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems and proposing a practical algorithm that solves sequences of unconstrained empirical problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning applications face growing requirements beyond accuracy, and existing approaches using weighted penalty combinations require extensive hyperparameter tuning. This becomes ineffective for multiple requirements, especially those involving equalities like fairness constraints and boundary value problems.

Method: The authors derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems and propose a practical algorithm that solves sequences of unconstrained, empirical learning problems to approximate solutions.

Result: The proposed method enables effective handling of equality constraints in various applications including fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems, overcoming limitations of traditional weighted penalty approaches.

Conclusion: Equality-constrained statistical learning provides a viable alternative to weighted penalty methods, with theoretical guarantees and practical algorithms that can handle complex requirements like fairness constraints and boundary conditions without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: As machine learning applications grow increasingly ubiquitous and complex, they face an increasing set of requirements beyond accuracy. The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems. We showcase its effectiveness and the new formulations enabled by equality constraints in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems.

*Nanxi Chen,Sifan Wang,Rujin Ma,Airong Chen,Chuanjie Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an irreversibility-regularized strategy for PINNs that enforces the Second Law of Thermodynamics as soft constraints during training, significantly improving solution accuracy across various physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional PINNs often neglect the hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, leading to unphysical solutions or training failures in irreversible physical processes.

Method: A simple, generalized irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during PINN training to ensure solutions respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible processes.

Result: Across multiple benchmarks (traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, crack propagation), the regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude with minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is broadly applicable to PDE-governed physical systems and will have significant impact in scientific machine learning by ensuring physically consistent solutions.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a new paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical laws into the learning process of neural networks. However, despite their foundational role, the hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics is often neglected during training, leading to unphysical solutions or even training failures in conventional PINNs. In this paper, we identify this critical gap and introduce a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks. We believe that the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide class of PDE-governed physical systems and will have significant impact within the scientific machine learning community.

*Bastien Vuillod,Pierre-Alain Moellic,Jean-Max Dutertre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analysis of how LoRA affects backdoor attacks in Federated Learning, showing lower LoRA ranks lead to longer backdoor persistence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the security implications of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (specifically LoRA) in Federated Learning, particularly regarding backdoor attack persistence.

Method: Conducted experiments analyzing the influence of LoRA rank on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks in FL settings, focusing on backdoor lifespan and persistence.

Result: Found that for optimally injected backdoors, lower LoRA ranks result in longer backdoor persistence after the attack ends.

Conclusion: Highlights evaluation issues in FL backdoor attacks and contributes to developing more robust evaluation methods for critical FL system risk assessments.

Abstract: Large models adaptation through Federated Learning (FL) addresses a wide range of use cases and is enabled by Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, this distributed learning paradigm faces several security threats, particularly to its integrity, such as backdoor attacks that aim to inject malicious behavior during the local training steps of certain clients. We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems. Our code is publicly available.

*Haobin Li,Mouxing Yang,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REST addresses query shift in cross-modal retrieval by enabling online adaptation and preserving general knowledge through gradient decoupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-modal retrieval methods assume full target-domain data availability, but real-world scenarios face query shift with online arrival and diverse user needs, undermining model performance.

Method: REST refines retrieval results for online adaptation and uses gradient decoupling to prevent forgetting of general knowledge during adaptation to diverse queries.

Result: Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks demonstrate REST's effectiveness against query shift.

Conclusion: REST successfully addresses both online and diverse query shift challenges in cross-modal retrieval through robust adaptation techniques.

Abstract: Recently, the general-to-customized paradigm has emerged as the dominant approach for Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR), which reconciles the distribution shift problem between the source domain and the target domain. However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowRoI is a fast optical-flow-based framework for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies, achieving 2.0-2.2x higher compression rates while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-throughput imaging platforms like ComplexEye generate massive amounts of data that impose substantial storage and transmission burdens, requiring efficient compression methods.

Method: FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames to derive ROI masks covering migrating cells, then jointly encodes raw images and ROI masks using JPEG2000 for ROI-aware compression.

Result: FlowRoI achieves computational efficiency comparable to standard JPEG2000 (30 fps on modern laptop), higher PSNR in cellular regions, and 2.0-2.2x higher compression rates at matched PSNR.

Conclusion: FlowRoI provides an effective solution for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies, enabling efficient data management without sacrificing image quality.

Abstract: Autonomous migration is essential for the function of immune cells such as neutrophils and plays a pivotal role in diverse diseases. Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU. In terms of image quality, FlowRoI yields higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in cellular regions and achieves 2.0-2.2x higher compression rates at matched PSNR compared to standard JPEG2000.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MiAD introduces mirage infusion to enable diffusion models to change atom states during crystal generation, achieving 2.5x quality improvement and 8.2% S.U.N. rate on MP-20 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for crystal material generation cannot change the number of atoms during generation, limiting sampling variability and model performance.

Method: Proposes mirage infusion technique that allows diffusion models to toggle atom states between existent and non-existent (mirage), creating MiAD - an equivariant joint diffusion model for crystal generation.

Result: MiAD achieves 2.5x quality improvement over baseline models and reaches 8.2% S.U.N. rate on MP-20 dataset, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Mirage infusion is a simple yet powerful technique that enables diffusion models to dynamically change atom counts during generation, significantly improving crystal material discovery performance.

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance in searching for simultaneously stable, unique, and novel (S.U.N.) crystalline materials. However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous cardiovascular monitoring is crucial for precision health, but key biomarkers like stroke volume and cardiac output require invasive arterial pressure waveform measurements. PPG is non-invasive but predicting biomarkers from PPG remains challenging due to scarcity of annotated data.

Method: Combines conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with conditional density estimator trained on labeled simulated APW segments, using hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data.

Result: The approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperforms supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.

Conclusion: The hybrid model successfully enables non-invasive estimation of cardiovascular biomarkers from PPG signals, addressing the challenge of limited annotated data through simulation and unlabeled clinical data integration.

Abstract: Continuous cardiovascular monitoring can play a key role in precision health. However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments. As a key result, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperform a supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.

Conclusion: CPFN provides an effective and efficient approach for conditional distribution estimation with theoretical guarantees and practical advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce conditional push-forward neural networks (CPFN), a generative framework for conditional distribution estimation. Instead of directly modeling the conditional density $f_{Y|X}$, CPFN learns a stochastic map $\varphi=\varphi(x,u)$ such that $\varphi(x,U)$ and $Y|X=x$ follow approximately the same law, with $U$ a suitable random vector of pre-defined latent variables. This enables efficient conditional sampling and straightforward estimation of conditional statistics through Monte Carlo methods. The model is trained via an objective function derived from a Kullback-Leibler formulation, without requiring invertibility or adversarial training. We establish a near-asymptotic consistency result and demonstrate experimentally that CPFN can achieve performance competitive with, or even superior to, state-of-the-art methods, including kernel estimators, tree-based algorithms, and popular deep learning techniques, all while remaining lightweight and easy to train.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches face a tradeoff: custom implementations ensure consistent interfaces but require manual adaptation and introduce numerical mismatch, while direct HuggingFace access preserves exact behavior but lacks standardization across models.

Method: Develop nnterp as a wrapper around NNsight with automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, providing built-in implementations of common interpretability methods and direct access to attention probabilities.

Result: nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families, with built-in validation tests for compatibility verification.

Conclusion: nnterp bridges the gap between correctness and usability in mechanistic interpretability tooling by providing a unified interface while preserving original model behavior.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research requires reliable tools for analyzing transformer internals across diverse architectures. Current approaches face a fundamental tradeoff: custom implementations like TransformerLens ensure consistent interfaces but require coding a manual adaptation for each architecture, introducing numerical mismatch with the original models, while direct HuggingFace access through NNsight preserves exact behavior but lacks standardization across models. To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it. By packaging validation tests with the library, researchers can verify compatibility with custom models locally. nnterp bridges the gap between correctness and usability in mechanistic interpretability tooling.

### [233] [Towards Stable and Structured Time Series Generation with Perturbation-Aware Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14488)
*Jintao Zhang,Mingyue Cheng,Zirui Liu,Xianquan Wang,Yitong Zhou,Qi Liu*

TL;DR: PAFM is a perturbation-aware flow matching framework that generates structurally consistent time series by modeling perturbed trajectories with dual-path velocity fields and mixture-of-experts decoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow matching methods fail to capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series due to globally shared parameters, limiting their ability to handle temporal heterogeneity caused by localized perturbations.

Method: Proposes PAFM with perturbation-guided training, dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations, and mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing for dynamic capacity allocation.

Result: Extensive experiments show PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks.

Conclusion: PAFM effectively addresses temporal heterogeneity in time series generation by modeling perturbed trajectories, ensuring stable and structurally consistent generation.

Abstract: Time series generation is critical for a wide range of applications, which greatly supports downstream analytical and decision-making tasks. However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{PAFM}, a \textbf{P}erturbation-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{F}low \textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: CLO is a CPU-light KVCache offloading system that addresses CPU bottlenecks in LLM inference through algorithm-system co-design, achieving 9.3%-66.6% throughput improvement while maintaining comparable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KVCache offloading systems suffer from CPU bottlenecks including fine-grained cache management overhead, poor PCIe bandwidth utilization due to gathering operations, and GPU runtime bubbles from CPU-centric synchronization.

Method: CLO uses coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching, seamless prefetching with persistent caching, zero-copy transfer engine for full PCIe bandwidth utilization, and GPU-centric synchronization to eliminate stalls.

Result: CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems while substantially reducing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, and improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6% on two widely-used LLMs.

Conclusion: Algorithm-system co-design is essential for memory-constrained LLM inference on modern GPU platforms, and CLO demonstrates significant performance improvements through its CPU-light approach.

Abstract: The growth of million-token LLMs exposes the scalability limits of inference systems, where the KVCache dominates memory usage and data transfer overhead. Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%. Our results highlight that algorithm-system co-design is essential for memory-constrained LLM inference on modern GPU platforms. We open source CLO at https://github.com/CommediaJW/CLO.

### [235] [Full Atom Peptide Design via Riemannian Euclidean Bayesian Flow Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14516)
*Hao Qian,Shikui Tu,Lei Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PepBFN is a Bayesian flow network for full atom peptide design that addresses limitations in current diffusion/flow matching models by modeling discrete residue types in continuous space and capturing multimodal side chain rotameric states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion and flow matching models for peptide design face two key challenges: (1) mismatch between categorical sampling of discrete residues and continuous evolution of other parameters, disrupting update dynamics; (2) unimodal assumptions for side-chain torsion angles conflict with inherently multimodal rotameric states.

Method: PepBFN directly models parameter distributions in fully continuous space, learning continuous distributions for discrete residue types. It uses Gaussian mixture Bayesian flow for multimodal side chain states and Matrix Fisher based Riemannian flow for residue orientations on SO(3) manifold. All parameters are progressively refined via Bayesian updates.

Result: Experiments on side chain packing, reverse folding, and binder design tasks demonstrate strong potential of PepBFN in computational peptide design.

Conclusion: PepBFN enables smooth and coherent peptide generation by addressing the fundamental mismatches in current approaches through continuous modeling of discrete parameters and capturing multimodal distributions.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have recently emerged as promising approaches for peptide binder design. Despite their progress, these models still face two major challenges. First, categorical sampling of discrete residue types collapses their continuous parameters into onehot assignments, while continuous variables (e.g., atom positions) evolve smoothly throughout the generation process. This mismatch disrupts the update dynamics and results in suboptimal performance. Second, current models assume unimodal distributions for side-chain torsion angles, which conflicts with the inherently multimodal nature of side chain rotameric states and limits prediction accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce PepBFN, the first Bayesian flow network for full atom peptide design that directly models parameter distributions in fully continuous space. Specifically, PepBFN models discrete residue types by learning their continuous parameter distributions, enabling joint and smooth Bayesian updates with other continuous structural parameters. It further employs a novel Gaussian mixture based Bayesian flow to capture the multimodal side chain rotameric states and a Matrix Fisher based Riemannian flow to directly model residue orientations on the $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ manifold. Together, these parameter distributions are progressively refined via Bayesian updates, yielding smooth and coherent peptide generation. Experiments on side chain packing, reverse folding, and binder design tasks demonstrate the strong potential of PepBFN in computational peptide design.

*Youran Zhou,Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid deterministic diffusion framework for mixed-type tabular data imputation that separates numerical and categorical features into complementary generative channels to address limitations of single diffusion processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based imputation models struggle with heterogeneous tabular data containing numerical, categorical, and discrete attributes, leading to conditional consistency issues, information collapse for categorical variables, and instability for numerical variables.

Method: Separates features into two channels: continuous DDIM-based channel for numerical variables and discrete latent-path diffusion channel for categorical/discrete features, trained under unified conditional imputation objective.

Result: Achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Structure-aware diffusion processes are crucial for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data, demonstrating the importance of tailored generative channels for different data types.

Abstract: Incomplete data are common in real-world tabular applications, where numerical, categorical, and discrete attributes coexist within a single dataset. This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.
  We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.
  Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Warping Index (WI) is a new metric for evaluating 2D dimensionality reduction projections by measuring how well they preserve empty regions between points, addressing visual distortion issues that existing metrics overlook.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing projection quality metrics focus on global/local structure preservation but ignore visual distortions, outliers, and artifacts that can mislead visual analysis of DR projections.

Method: Introduces the Warping Index (WI) metric based on the assumption that preserving empty regions between points is crucial for faithful visual representation of high-dimensional data in 2D projections.

Result: The WI metric specifically measures the preservation of empty regions in DR projections, addressing a gap in current quality assessment methods.

Conclusion: The Warping Index provides a new approach to evaluating DR projection quality by focusing on visual distortion aspects that previous metrics have largely ignored.

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used for the visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional data due to their ability to project datasets of high-dimensional points onto the 2D plane. However, projecting datasets in lower dimensions often entails some distortion, which is not necessarily easy to recognize but can lead users to misleading conclusions. Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data.

*Adam Hazimeh,Alessandro Favero,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Task arithmetic works for closed-vocabulary models too, achieving efficient multi-task deployment with competitive performance compared to linear probing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task arithmetic has shown promise for open-vocabulary models but hasn't been explored for closed-vocabulary models, which are abundant and not pre-trained with language supervision.

Method: Applied task arithmetic to closed-vocabulary image classification models across different pre-training schemes, studying weight disentanglement properties.

Result: Found that weight disentanglement enabling task arithmetic is a general consequence of pre-training, appearing in various closed-vocabulary models. Vision transformers can be edited with task arithmetic to achieve high performance.

Conclusion: Task arithmetic expands to closed-vocabulary models, enabling efficient multi-task deployment and opening possibilities for broader use of pre-trained models.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising method for editing pre-trained \textit{open-vocabulary} models, offering a cost-effective alternative to standard multi-task fine-tuning. However, despite the abundance of \textit{closed-vocabulary} models that are not pre-trained with language supervision, applying task arithmetic to these models remains unexplored. In this paper, we deploy and study task addition in closed-vocabulary image classification models. We consider different pre-training schemes and find that \textit{weight disentanglement} -- the property enabling task arithmetic -- is a general consequence of pre-training, as it appears in different pre-trained closed-vocabulary models. In fact, we find that pre-trained closed-vocabulary vision transformers can also be edited with task arithmetic, achieving high task addition performance and enabling the efficient deployment of multi-task models. Finally, we demonstrate that simple linear probing is a competitive baseline to task addition. Overall, our findings expand the applicability of task arithmetic to a broader class of pre-trained models and open the way for more efficient use of pre-trained models in diverse settings.

TL;DR: ReflexGrad integrates hierarchical task decomposition, causal reflection, and gradient-based optimization to enable zero-shot generalization in reinforcement learning without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of enabling agents to learn from experience and generalize across diverse tasks without task-specific training, which remains a fundamental problem in reinforcement learning.

Method: Combines three mechanisms: LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for planning, history-aware causal reflection for analyzing action patterns and identifying failure causes, and gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement.

Result: Achieves 67% zero-shot success rate on ALFWorld benchmark tasks on Trial 0 without prior task experience or demonstrations, with 67% to 78% improvement in cross-task transfer.

Conclusion: Synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work.

Abstract: Enabling agents to learn from experience and generalize across diverse tasks without task-specific training remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning and decision-making. While recent approaches have explored episodic memory (Reflexion), gradient-based prompt optimization (TextGrad),and hierarchical task decomposition independently, their potential for synergistic integration remains unexplored. We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure. Through empirical analysis, we identify the architectural mechanisms underlying stable convergence (zero action loops) and effective cross-task transfer (67% to 78% improvement).Our work demonstrates that synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work.

Result: Outperforms standard EM algorithm in synthetic medical simulations under low-data and high-noise conditions; successfully recovers clinically coherent POMDP in Myasthenia Gravis case study.

Conclusion: Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm is a practical tool for data-efficient modeling in healthcare, effectively leveraging expert knowledge to improve parameter estimation in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Learning the parameters of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) from limited data is a significant challenge. We introduce the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm, a novel approach that incorporates expert knowledge into the parameter estimation process by enriching the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework with fuzzy pseudo-counts derived from an expert-defined fuzzy model. This integration naturally reformulates the problem as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, effectively guiding learning in environments with limited data. In synthetic medical simulations, our method consistently outperforms the standard EM algorithm under both low-data and high-noise conditions. Furthermore, a case study on Myasthenia Gravis illustrates the ability of the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm to recover a clinically coherent POMDP, demonstrating its potential as a practical tool for data-efficient modeling in healthcare.

TL;DR: LLMs fail to follow probabilistic distributions in outputs, preferring near-exclusive generation of marginally highest probability outputs over exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific idea generation requires probabilistic exploration, but current AI benchmarks and RL training discourage this behavior in LLMs.

Method: Systematic experiments requesting LLMs to produce outputs following simple probabilistic distributions, testing binary outputs with specified probabilities.

Result: All modern LLMs tested grossly fail to follow distributions - requesting '1' 49% of the time produces '0' nearly 100% of the time, showing step function-like behavior.

Conclusion: LLMs strongly prefer generating outputs with marginally highest probability, overriding even strong in-built biases, which hinders probabilistic exploration needed for scientific creativity.

Abstract: Scientific idea generation and selection requires exploration following a target probability distribution. In contrast, current AI benchmarks have objectively correct answers, and training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning against these benchmarks discourages probabilistic exploration. Here, we conducted systematic experiments requesting LLMs to produce outputs following simple probabilistic distributions, and found that all modern LLMs tested grossly fail to follow the distributions. For example, requesting a binary output of "1" 49% of the time produces an answer of "0" nearly 100% of the time. This step function-like behavior of near-exclusively generating the output with marginally highest probability even overrules even strong in-built LLM biases.

TL;DR: Adapformer is a Transformer-based framework for multivariate time series forecasting that adaptively combines channel-independent and channel-dependent approaches through a dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture to improve accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MTSF models use either channel-independent (CI) or channel-dependent (CD) strategies, but CI fails to capture inter-channel dependencies while CD risks overfitting with extraneous information. There's a need for an adaptive approach that balances both.

Method: Adapformer uses a dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture with Adaptive Channel Enhancer (ACE) to enrich embeddings by selectively incorporating dependencies, and Adaptive Channel Forecaster (ACF) to refine predictions by focusing on relevant covariates while reducing noise.

Result: Rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Adapformer represents state-of-the-art in multivariate time series forecasting by effectively addressing the limitations of traditional CI and CD approaches through adaptive channel management.

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), accurately modeling the intricate dependencies among multiple variables remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional approaches. Most existing models adopt either \textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{E}nhancer (\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{F}orecaster (\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.

### [243] [DualLaguerreNet: A Decoupled Spectral Filter GNN and the Uncovering of the Flexibility-Stability Trade-off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13729)
*Huseyin Goksu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: DualLaguerreNet is a novel GNN architecture that introduces decoupled spectral flexibility by splitting graph Laplacian into low/high-frequency operators with independent adaptive filters, achieving SOTA on heterophilic tasks but revealing a flexibility-stability trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-filter GNNs suffer from a 'compromise' problem where a single adaptive parameter must learn suboptimal averaged responses across the entire graph spectrum, limiting performance on complex heterophilic tasks.

Method: Proposes DualLaguerreNet that splits graph Laplacian into L_low and L_high operators, learning two independent adaptive Laguerre polynomial filters parameterized by alpha_1 and alpha_2 respectively, providing decoupled spectral flexibility.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on complex heterophilic tasks (outperforming LaguerreNet), but simultaneously underperforms on simpler homophilic tasks due to overfitting from increased parameterization.

Conclusion: Reveals a fundamental 'Flexibility-Stability Trade-off' where increased parameterization leads to overfitting on simple tasks, demonstrating that the 'compromise' of simpler models acts as a crucial regularizer in adaptive GNN filter design.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on spectral filters, such as the Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter (AOPF) class (e.g., LaguerreNet), have shown promise in unifying the solutions for heterophily and over-smoothing. However, these single-filter models suffer from a "compromise" problem, as their single adaptive parameter (e.g., alpha) must learn a suboptimal, averaged response across the entire graph spectrum. In this paper, we propose DualLaguerreNet, a novel GNN architecture that solves this by introducing "Decoupled Spectral Flexibility." DualLaguerreNet splits the graph Laplacian into two operators, L_low (low-frequency) and L_high (high-frequency), and learns two independent, adaptive Laguerre polynomial filters, parameterized by alpha_1 and alpha_2, respectively. This work, however, uncovers a deeper finding. While our experiments show DualLaguerreNet's flexibility allows it to achieve state-of-the-art results on complex heterophilic tasks (outperforming LaguerreNet), it simultaneously underperforms on simpler, homophilic tasks. We identify this as a fundamental "Flexibility-Stability Trade-off". The increased parameterization (2x filter parameters and 2x model parameters) leads to overfitting on simple tasks, demonstrating that the "compromise" of simpler models acts as a crucial regularizer. This paper presents a new SOTA architecture for heterophily while providing a critical analysis of the bias-variance trade-off inherent in adaptive GNN filter design.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: GegenbauerNet addresses the Flexibility-Stability Trade-off in spectral GNNs by using symmetric Gegenbauer polynomials with a single learnable shape parameter, achieving optimal performance in local filtering regimes while maintaining high performance in high-K filtering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the fundamental Flexibility-Stability Trade-off in spectral GNNs, where previous adaptive methods suffered from high variance while static methods had fixed bias, seeking an optimal compromise between flexibility and stability.

Method: Proposed GegenbauerNet based on Gegenbauer polynomials, enforcing symmetry (alpha=beta) with a single learnable shape parameter (lambda) to limit variance while escaping fixed bias of static methods.

Result: GegenbauerNet (1-parameter) achieves superior performance in local filtering regime (K=2 on heterophilic graphs) with minimal overfitting, while L-JacobiNet maintains highest performance on high-K filtering tasks when regularization is managed.

Conclusion: The optimal filter in [-1,1] spectral domain critically depends on target locality (K) and acceptable design bias level, providing crucial design principles for GNN developers.

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) operating in the canonical [-1, 1] domain (like ChebyNet and its adaptive generalization, L-JacobiNet) face a fundamental Flexibility-Stability Trade-off. Our previous work revealed a critical puzzle: the 2-parameter adaptive L-JacobiNet often suffered from high variance and was surprisingly outperformed by the 0-parameter, stabilized-static S-JacobiNet. This suggested that stabilization was more critical than adaptation in this domain. In this paper, we propose \textbf{GegenbauerNet}, a novel GNN filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomials, to find the Optimal Compromise in this trade-off. By enforcing symmetry (alpha=beta) but allowing a single shape parameter (lambda) to be learned, GegenbauerNet limits flexibility (variance) while escaping the fixed bias of S-JacobiNet. We demonstrate that GegenbauerNet (1-parameter) achieves superior performance in the key local filtering regime (K=2 on heterophilic graphs) where overfitting is minimal, validating the hypothesis that a controlled, symmetric degree of freedom is optimal. Furthermore, our comprehensive K-ablation study across homophilic and heterophilic graphs, using 7 diverse datasets, clarifies the domain's behavior: the fully adaptive L-JacobiNet maintains the highest performance on high-K filtering tasks, showing the value of maximum flexibility when regularization is managed. This study provides crucial design principles for GNN developers, showing that in the [-1, 1] spectral domain, the optimal filter depends critically on the target locality (K) and the acceptable level of design bias.

Method: Constructs sparse representation of multi-target sensing channel with cross sparsity structure under three-layer hierarchical prior model, and develops structured fast turbo variational Bayesian inference (SF-TVBI) algorithm with message-passing strategy and two-timescale update scheme.

Result: Simulation results show substantial improvement in target angle estimation accuracy by leveraging cross sparsity structure, with SF-TVBI achieving comparable performance to Turbo-VBI but with lower computational complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed cross sparsity structure effectively exploits first-order multipath components to enhance target direction estimation, and the SF-TVBI algorithm provides computationally efficient inference while maintaining high estimation accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a multi-target sensing system in multipath environment, where inter-target scattering gives rise to first-order reflected paths whose angles of departure (AoDs) and angles of arrival (AoAs) coincide with the direct-path angles of different targets. Unlike other multipath components, these first-order paths carry structural information that can be exploited as additional prior knowledge for target direction estimation. To exploit this property, we construct a sparse representation of the multi-target sensing channel and propose a novel cross sparsity structure under a three-layer hierarchical structured (3LHS) prior model, which leverages the first-order paths to enhance the prior probability of the direct paths and thereby improve the estimation accuracy. Building on this model, we propose a structured fast turbo variational Bayesian inference (SF-TVBI) algorithm, which integrates an efficient message-passing strategy to enable tractable probabilistic exchange within the cross sparsity, and a two-timescale update scheme to reduce the update frequency of the high-dimensional sparse vector. Simulation results demonstrate that leveraging the proposed cross sparsity structure is able to improve the target angle estimation accuracy substantially, and the SF-TVBI algorithm achieves estimation performance comparable to that of the Turbo-VBI, but with lower computational complexity.

TL;DR: THD-BAR is a novel EEG representation learning framework that introduces Brain Topology Hierarchy to capture spatial-temporal dynamics through next-scale-time prediction, outperforming existing methods across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive EEG models rely on simple temporal sequencing and fail to capture physiological characteristics and dynamic spatial topology of brain activity.

Method: Proposes Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling (THD-BAR) with Brain Topology Hierarchy for multi-scale spatial ordering, THVQ-VAE for multi-scale tokenization, and enhanced BAR module with specialized masking strategies.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on 10 downstream datasets spanning 5 distinct tasks after large-scale pre-training on 17 datasets, demonstrating superior generalization and modeling capabilities.

Conclusion: THD-BAR effectively captures both spatial and temporal dynamics in EEG signals through its hierarchical topology approach, showing significant potential for universal EEG representations.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained models hold significant potential for learning universal EEG representations. However, most existing methods, particularly autoregressive (AR) frameworks, primarily rely on straightforward temporal sequencing of multi-channel EEG data, which fails to capture the rich physiological characteristics inherent to EEG signals. Moreover, their time-centered modeling approach also limits the effective representation of the dynamic spatial topology of brain activity. To address these challenges and fully exploit the potential of large-scale EEG models, we propose a novel Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling (THD-BAR) for EEG generic representations. The core innovation of THD-BAR lies in the introduction of the Brain Topology Hierarchy (BTH), which establishes a multi-scale spatial order for EEG channels. This hierarchical structure enables a redefinition of autoregressive learning as a "next-scale-time prediction" problem, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Based on BTH, we design a Topology-Hierarchical Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (THVQ-VAE) for multi-scale tokenization and develop an enhanced Brain Autoregressive (BAR) module with specialized masking strategies for prediction. Through extensive large-scale pre-training on 17 datasets, followed by rigorous validation on 10 downstream datasets spanning 5 distinct tasks, THD-BAR consistently outperforms existing methods. These results highlight the superior generalization and modeling capabilities of our proposed approach.

Conclusion: Algorithm-hardware co-design enables efficient implementation of state space models in CIM systems for real-time event-driven processing applications

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for long sequence processing, outperforming traditional methods on diverse benchmarks. Fundamentally, SSMs can generalize both recurrent and convolutional networks and have been shown to even capture key functions of biological systems. Here we report an approach to implement SSMs in energy-efficient compute-in-memory (CIM) hardware to achieve real-time, event-driven processing. Our work re-parameterizes the model to function with real-valued coefficients and shared decay constants, reducing the complexity of model mapping onto practical hardware systems. By leveraging device dynamics and diagonalized state transition parameters, the state evolution can be natively implemented in crossbar-based CIM systems combined with memristors exhibiting short-term memory effects. Through this algorithm and hardware co-design, we show the proposed system offers both high accuracy and high energy efficiency while supporting fully asynchronous processing for event-based vision and audio tasks.

Motivation: To develop effective multi-view imaging in 6G integrated sensing and communication networks that can jointly leverage targets' echo signals from multiple receive BSs for precise environment reconstruction.

Result: Extensive numerical results show significant enhancement in imaging performance, enabling high-quality environment reconstruction for future 6G networks.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme facilitates high-quality multi-view imaging and environment reconstruction in 6G integrated sensing and communication networks.

Abstract: This paper considers multi-view imaging in a sixth-generation (6G) integrated sensing and communication network, which consists of a transmit base-station (BS), multiple receive BSs connected to a central processing unit (CPU), and multiple extended targets. Our goal is to devise an effective multi-view imaging technique that can jointly leverage the targets' echo signals at all the receive BSs to precisely construct the image of these targets. To achieve this goal, we propose a two-phase approach. In Phase I, each receive BS recovers an individual image based on the sample covariance matrix of its received signals. Specifically, we propose a novel covariance-based imaging framework to jointly estimate effective scattering intensity and grid positions, which reduces the number of estimated parameters leveraging channel statistical properties and allows grid adjustment to conform to target geometry. In Phase II, the CPU fuses the individual images of all the receivers to construct a high-quality image of all the targets. Specifically, we design edge-preserving natural neighbor interpolation (EP-NNI) to map individual heterogeneous images onto common and finer grids, and then propose a joint optimization framework to estimate fused scattering intensity and BS fields of view. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly enhances imaging performance, facilitating high-quality environment reconstruction for future 6G networks.

Conclusion: SIM-based CR-ISAC framework effectively balances localization and communication objectives, offering superior performance over conventional approaches for future wireless networks.

Abstract: The fusion of cognitive radio (CR) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), enabled by stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), offers a promising path for multi-functional programmable front ends in 6G and beyond. In this paper we propose a novel CR-ISAC framework that leverages an SIM integrated with the secondary base station (SB) to learn and realize optimal beampatterns that simultaneously (i) minimize the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB) for localizing a secondary user equipment (SU) and (ii) limit averaged interference at primary user equipments (PUs) so that spectral efficiency loss is constrained, with the target of at most a few percent degradation. We propose an efficient alternating optimization-based algorithm to obtain the optimal end-to-end transmission response of the SIM for all orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers. Drawing an analogy between the layered SIM architecture and deep neural networks, we define a beampattern- matching loss, derive analytical gradients for backpropagation, and implement a learning-based optimization of the SIM coefficients using a mini-batch Adam optimizer. A complexity analysis is provided, and extensive numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed CR-ISAC framework. The results show that the proposed SIM coefficient optimization methods attain near-optimal performance in terms of both the SU BCRB localization metric and the PUs average spectral efficiency when the SIM has a sufficient number of layers, and they substantially outperform traditional single-layer reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) designs.

TL;DR: A CNN-based model using EEG and ECG signals achieves 97.52% accuracy in predicting neonatal seizures up to 30 minutes before onset, with explainable AI for clinical transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neonatal seizures are subtle and often misdiagnosed, increasing risk of brain injury. Current gold standard (cEEG) is expensive and requires expertise, creating need for automated early detection.

Method: Patient-independent CNN model using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients from multichannel EEG and ECG signals, with attention mechanism and 10-fold cross-validation on Helsinki neonatal EEG dataset.

Result: Achieved 97.52% accuracy, 98.31% sensitivity, 96.39% specificity, and 97.95% F1-score. ECG inclusion improved F1-score by 1.42%, attention mechanism added 0.5% improvement.

Conclusion: Model enables reliable seizure prediction 30 minutes before onset with strong generalization across subjects, suitable for minimally supervised deployment in NICUs with explainable AI for clinical trust.

Abstract: Neonates are highly susceptible to seizures, often leading to short or long-term neurological impairments. However, clinical manifestations of neonatal seizures are subtle and often lead to misdiagnoses. This increases the risk of prolonged, untreated seizure activity and subsequent brain injury. Continuous video electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring is the gold standard for seizure detection. However, this is an expensive evaluation that requires expertise and time. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network-based model for early prediction of neonatal seizures by distinguishing between interictal and preictal states of the EEG. Our model is patient-independent, enabling generalization across multiple subjects, and utilizes mel-frequency cepstral coefficient matrices extracted from multichannel EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals as input features. Trained and validated on the Helsinki neonatal EEG dataset with 10-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 97.52%, sensitivity of 98.31%, specificity of 96.39%, and F1-score of 97.95%, enabling accurate seizure prediction up to 30 minutes before onset. The inclusion of ECG alongside EEG improved the F1-score by 1.42%, while the incorporation of an attention mechanism yielded an additional 0.5% improvement. To enhance transparency, we incorporated SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) as an explainable artificial intelligence method to interpret the model and provided localization of seizure focus using scalp plots. The overall results demonstrate the model's potential for minimally supervised deployment in neonatal intensive care units, enabling timely and reliable prediction of neonatal seizures, while demonstrating strong generalization capability across unseen subjects through transfer learning.

TL;DR: Proposed an integrated positioning and communication framework for multi-LEO satellite networks that leverages positioning information to improve uplink channel estimation and uses cooperative multi-satellite detection to overcome link-budget limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LEO satellite communication faces challenges in acquiring reliable channel state information due to severe signal attenuation and short coherence times, but benefits from line-of-sight dominance and geometric properties tied to positioning information.

Method: Developed a dual-timescale Kalman filter framework: UKF for tracking user position/velocity in large timescale, and Kalman filter using position information for improved channel estimation in small timescale, combined with EM algorithm for joint channel estimation and cooperative data detection.

Result: Numerical results show the proposed IPAC approach outperforms conventional baselines in both channel estimation accuracy and communication performance.

Conclusion: The integrated positioning and communication framework effectively addresses LEO channel challenges by exploiting position information and cooperative multi-satellite detection, demonstrating improved performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are a crucial component of the future non-terrestrial networks (NTN) due to lower latency, robust signal strengths, shorter revisit times, and dense constellations. However, acquiring reliable channel state information (CSI) in LEO satellite communication remains challenging owing to severe signal attenuation over long propagation distances and short coherence times. Despite these challenges, LEO channels benefit from pronounced line-of-sight dominance and geometric properties inherently tied to positioning information. In this work, we propose an integrated positioning and communication (IPAC) framework for multi-LEO satellite networks to address the unique challenges posed by LEO channels. Specifically, we leverage in-the-loop LEO positioning to exploit users' position information for improving uplink CSI acquisition. To overcome the link-budget limitations of single-satellite systems, cooperative multi-LEO uplink data detection is adopted. By exploiting the different coherent timescales of position-related parameters and random channel gains, we develop a dual-timescale Kalman filter-based IPAC framework: an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for tracking users' position and velocity in the large-timescale, and a Kalman filter that leverages the position information obtained in the large-timescale for improved data-aided uplink channel estimation in the small-timescale. Finally, the two tasks of channel estimation and cooperative data detection are jointly addressed through the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed IPAC approach outperforms the conventional baseline in terms of channel estimation accuracy and communication performance.

Conclusion: ComGAN effectively reconstructs incomplete fingerprint databases, enabling accurate indoor localization without requiring comprehensive measurement collection at all reference points.

Abstract: This letter presents a feature-guided adversarial framework, namely ComGAN, which is designed to reconstruct an incomplete fingerprint database by inferring missing received signal strength (RSS) values at unmeasured reference points (RPs). An auxiliary subnetwork is integrated into a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to enable spatial feature learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of conventional sub-connected pinching antenna systems by enabling full connectivity between RF chains and waveguides, facilitating more flexible beamforming while maintaining energy efficiency.

Method: Developed two algorithms: 1) FP-based alternating optimization using SHADE for PA position optimization, and 2) ZF-based approach with modified SHADE for reduced complexity.

Result: Simulation results show FC-THB PASS achieves comparable weighted sum-rate to SC architecture while providing superior energy efficiency with fewer RF chains.

Conclusion: The proposed fully-connected tri-hybrid beamforming architecture successfully balances performance and energy efficiency, offering a promising alternative to conventional sub-connected systems.

Abstract: A novel fully-connected (FC) tri-hybrid beamforming (THB) architecture is proposed for pinching antenna systems (PASS). In contrast to conventional sub-connected (SC) PASS, the proposed FC architecture employs a tunable phase-shifter network to interconnect all radio frequency (RF) chains with all waveguides. This facilitates a THB framework that integrates conventional hybrid analog-digital beamforming with pinching beamforming. A weighted sum-rate (WSR) optimization problem is then formulated to jointly optimize the transmit beamformers and pinching antenna (PA) positions. Two algorithms are developed to address this challenging non-convex problem. 1) Fractional programming (FP)-based algorithm: This algorithm directly maximizes the WSR using an FP-based alternating optimization framework. Particularly, a success-history based adaptive differential evolution (SHADE) method is proposed to optimize PA positions, effectively addressing the intractable multimodal objective function. 2) Zero-forcing (ZF)-based algorithm: To reduce design complexity, zero-forcing is employed for transmit beamforming. The PA positions are subsequently optimized to maximize the WSR via a modified SHADE method. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, revealing that the FC-THB PASS achieves WSR comparable to the SC architecture while delivering superior energy efficiency with fewer RF chains.

Motivation: To support low-altitude economy development while maintaining compatibility with existing 5G networks, addressing fundamental limitations in sensing resolution when using standard 5G NR signals alone.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage I fuses SSB, Type#0-PDCCH, and SIB1 for initial detection; Stage II uses custom sparse pilot structure in CORSET#0 bandwidth with weighted unwrapped phase and RELAX-based iterative algorithms for refined estimation, plus DBSCAN for pruning redundant detections.

Result: Comprehensive simulations show superior estimation accuracy and computational efficiency compared to other techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively overcomes resolution limitations of standard 5G NR signals and provides high-precision UAV sensing capabilities for integrated sensing and communication applications.

Abstract: The evolution of next-generation wireless networks has spurred the vigorous development of the low-altitude economy (LAE). To support this emerging field while remaining compatible with existing network architectures, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) based on 5G New Radio (NR) signals is regarded as a promising solution. However, merely leveraging standard 5G NR signals, such as the Synchronization Signal Block (SSB), presents fundamental limitations in sensing resolution. To address the issue, this paper proposes a two-stage coarse-to-fine sensing framework that utilizes standard 5G NR initial access signals augmented by a custom-designed sparse pilot structure (SPS) for high-precision unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) sensing. In Stage I, we first fuse information from the SSB, Type\#0-PDCCH, and system information block 1 (SIB1) to ensure the initial target detection. In Stage II, a refined estimation algorithm is introduced to overcome the resolution limitations of these signals. Inspired by the sparse array theory, this stage employs a novel SPS, which is inserted into resource blocks (RBs) within the CORSET\#0 bandwidth. To accurately extract the off-grid range and velocity parameters from these sparse pilots, we develop a corresponding high-resolution algorithm based on the weighted unwrapped phase (WUP) technique and the RELAX-based iterative method. Finally, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is adopted to prune the redundant detections arising from beam overlap. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate the superior estimation accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed framework in comparison to other techniques.

Abstract: Radio spectrum monitoring in contested environments motivates the need for reliable automatic signal classification technology. Prior work highlights deep learning as a promising approach, but existing models depend on brute-force Doppler augmentation to achieve real-world generalization, which undermines both training efficiency and interpretability. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with complex-valued layers that exploits convolutional shift equivariance in the frequency domain. To establish provable frequency bin shift invariance, we use adaptive polyphase sampling (APS) as pooling layers followed by a global average pooling layer at the end of the network. Using a synthetic dataset of common interference signals, experimental results demonstrate that unlike a vanilla CNN, our model maintains consistent classification accuracy with and without random Doppler shifts despite being trained on no Doppler-shifted examples. Overall, our method establishes an invariance-driven framework for signal classification that offers provable robustness against real-world effects.
