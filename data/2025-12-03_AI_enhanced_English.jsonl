However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($\u03b4$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $\u03b4> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\\mathbb{E}[n] \\leq 4/\u03b4$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system.

Code available at: https://github.com/hdeng26/Contex", "summary": "Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets.

Traditional computer-aided diagnosis systems have limitations in their ability to represent features and generalize to the range of mammographic images. We present a new two-level Stack of Transformers (TT-Stack) ensemble framework based on using heterogeneous lightweight vision transformer architectures to automatically identify breast cancer in mammograms. Specifically, we integrate seven state-of-the-art vision transformers: RepViT, DaViT, EfficientViT, MobileViT, FasterViT, MViT, and PVT v2 while also designing a two-tier meta-learning approach for the ensemble by simply taking the logits from the base model and applying logistic regression for binary classification (Cancer vs. Non-Cancer). Each of the transformer backbone models was developed to process single-channel grayscale mammograms while still taking advantage of transfer learning from pre-training on ImageNet so that they would offer a parameter-efficient approach that may reasonably be applied in clinical practice with minimal variance. The training process included stratified 80/20 splits when necessary, class-balanced upsampling, early stopping, and an adaptive learning rate schedule on the public Mammogram Mastery dataset. In separate evaluations here, it was determined that EfficientViT and PVT-v2 were the top per-forming models achieving 99.33% validation, 97.96% F1-score, and perfect 1.000:0 ROC-AUC with only small train/validation gaps. Finally, the TT-Stack ensemble model by the end of the evaluation reached 99.33% accuracy with 100% precision, 96% recall, 97.96% F1-score and a 99.97% ROC-AUC, and demonstrated robustness in performance due to the diversity of the architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "A two-level Stack of Transformers (TT-Stack) ensemble framework using seven lightweight vision transformers achieves state-of-the-art performance for breast cancer detection in mammograms, with 99.33% accuracy and 99.97% ROC-AUC.", "motivation": "Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving survival rates.

Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts.

Closed-form fully digital BF/AN solutions are obtained via a generalized spectral water-filling procedure within a block coordinate descent (BCD) surrogate and realized by a hardware-efficient hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture that embeds AN in the baseband without extra radio-frequency (RF) chains. For FAS port selection, a row-energy based prune--refit rule, aligned with Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) conditions of a group-sparsity surrogate, enables efficient active-port determination.

This paper focuses on collaborative sensing in multi-AP networks and proposes a Bayesian probability fusion framework for target parameter estimation using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing waveform. The framework models multi-AP received signals as probability distributions to capture stochastic observations from channel noise and scattering coefficients.

Based on the prototype, we develop two extensions: Code A1, which removes specific redundant trits to achieve higher information rate and support variable-length encoding; and Code A2, which incorporates two group-sum checks together with a 3-wise XOR linear independence condition on index subsets, yielding a ternary distance-4 (SEC--TED) variant. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the framework generalizes via $n$-wise XOR linearly independent sets to construct codes with distance $d = n + 1$, notably recovering the ternary Golay code for $n = 5$ -- showing both structural generality and a serendipitous link to optimal classical codes.\n  Our contribution is not optimality but \\emph{implementational simplicity} and an \\emph{array-friendly} structure: the checks are digitwise and global sums, the mapping from syndromes to error location is explicit, and the SEC--TED upgrade is modular.

However, CSI acquisition in FR3 systems faces significant challenges: the increased number of antennas and wider transmission bandwidth introduces prohibitive training overhead with traditional estimation approaches, as each probing captures only incomplete spatial-frequency observation, while higher carrier frequencies lead to faster temporal channel variation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI acquisition framework that integrates CSI feedback, uplink (UL) and DL channel estimation, as well as channel prediction in the FR3 TDD massive MIMO systems. Specifically, we first develop the Joint UL and DL Channel Estimation Network (JUDCEN) to fuse incomplete observations based on the SRSs and CSI-RSs. By exploiting the complementary characteristics of preliminary UL and DL estimation features, obtained through initial UL estimation and quantized-feedback-assisted DL estimation, it enables full CSI reconstruction in the spatial domain. To mitigate the performance degradation in the feedback process, we propose the Transformer-MLP CSI Feedback Network (TMCFN), employing an MLP-based module to jointly exploit angle- and delay-domain features. Building upon the reconstructed full CSI, we further develop the Mamba-based Channel Prediction Network (MCPN), which exploits selective state-space model (SSM) mechanism to capture long-range temporal dynamics in the angle-delay domain for future CSI prediction.

In this work, we propose an efficient transfer learning method using a tensor kernel machine. Our method takes inspiration from the adaptive SVM and hence transfers 'knowledge' from the source to the 'adapted' model via regularization. The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG.

To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues.

This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief.

(2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This \"virtue signaling gap\" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric.

Naively applying one-shot methods in a continual setting triggers a stability crisis, leading to a cascade of degradation characterized by retention collapse, compounding collateral damage to related concepts, and a sharp decline in generative quality. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel generative distillation based continual unlearning framework that ensures targeted and stable unlearning under sequences of deletion requests.

We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context.

Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens.

Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise.

The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning.
