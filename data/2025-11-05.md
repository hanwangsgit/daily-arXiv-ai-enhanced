### [1] [iFlyBot-VLA Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01914)
*Yuan Zhang,Chenyu Xue,Wenjie Xu,Chao Ji,Jiajia wu,Jia Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iFlyBot-VLA is a Vision-Language-Action model with dual-level action representation that combines latent actions from manipulation videos and structured discrete action tokens, achieving superior performance on robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework that aligns language, vision, and action representations for robotic manipulation, enabling vision-language models to directly contribute to action generation.

Method: Uses a latent action model trained on manipulation videos, dual-level action representation (latent actions and structured discrete tokens), and mixed training with robot trajectory data plus QA datasets to enhance 3D perception.

Result: Demonstrates superiority on LIBERO Franka benchmark and achieves competitive success rates in real-world manipulation tasks across diverse challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges vision-language understanding with action generation, showing promising results for robotic manipulation tasks, with plans to open-source datasets for community research.

Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model
trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows:
(1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic
manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that
jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert
during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory
data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the
VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions,
derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment
manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured
discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of
continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual
supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action,
enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental
results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our
frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves
competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset
to support future research in the community

### [2] [Challenging DINOv3 Foundation Model under Low Inter-Class Variability: A Case Study on Fetal Brain Ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01915)
*Edoardo Conti,Riccardo Rosati,Lorenzo Federici,Adriano Mancini,Maria Chiara Fiorentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First comprehensive evaluation of foundation models in fetal ultrasound imaging under low inter-class variability conditions, focusing on distinguishing anatomically similar fetal brain standard planes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like DINOv3 show transferability in medical domains, but their ability to discriminate anatomically similar structures with overlapping features hasn't been systematically investigated, particularly for fetal brain standard planes crucial for biometric assessment.

Method: Curated all public fetal ultrasound datasets into FetalUS-188K benchmark (188K+ annotated images). DINOv3 pretrained self-supervised for ultrasound-aware representations, evaluated through linear probing and fine-tuning with two initialization schemes: pretraining on FetalUS-188K vs natural-image DINOv3 weights.

Result: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed natural-image initialized models, with up to 20% F1-score improvements. Domain-adaptive pretraining preserved subtle echogenic and structural cues needed to distinguish intermediate planes.

Conclusion: Generic foundation models fail to generalize under low inter-class variability, while domain-specific pretraining is essential for robust and clinically reliable representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

Abstract: Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation
models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability
conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown
remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to
discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically
investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard
planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar
(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical
challenge for reliable biometric assessment.
  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available
fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified
multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated
images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a
self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned
features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols,
including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two
initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization
from natural-image DINOv3 weights.
  Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed
those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up
to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve
subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate
planes such as TV.
  Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to
generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific
pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable
representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

### [3] [Assessing the value of Geo-Foundational Models for Flood Inundation Mapping: Benchmarking models for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planetscope for end-users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01990)
*Saurabh Kaushik,Lalit Maurya,Elizabeth Tellman,ZhiJie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) show competitive performance for flood inundation mapping across different satellite sensors, with Clay emerging as the best overall performer due to better accuracy, computational efficiency, and few-shot learning capabilities compared to traditional U-Net models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare GFMs against traditional models like U-Net for flood inundation mapping across different sensors and data availability scenarios, addressing the lack of comprehensive evaluation to guide end-users in model selection.

Method: Evaluated three GFMs (Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT) against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 data. Conducted leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions and 19 sites, plus few-shot experiments with limited training data.

Result: GFMs show competitive performance with only 2-5% variation between best and worst models. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In cross-validation, Clay shows slightly better performance across all sensors and achieves 4% improvement over U-Net. Clay also excels in few-shot learning (0.64 mIoU with just 5 training images) and is computationally efficient (26M parameters, 3x faster than Prithvi).

Conclusion: GFMs offer small to moderate improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling effort compared to traditional U-Net, with Clay being the most practical choice due to its balance of performance, efficiency, and few-shot learning capabilities.

Abstract: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of
spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation
mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it
remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A
systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still
lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To
address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a
Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using
PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance
among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models
across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and
Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In
leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly
better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07),
0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA
(0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and
Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out
cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual
inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot
experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training
images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational
time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters),
making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M).
Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate
improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling
effort compared to traditional U-Net.

### [4] [Locally-Supervised Global Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01998)
*Benjamin Walder,Daniel Toader,Robert Nuster,Günther Paltauf,Peter Burgholzer,Gregor Langer,Lukas Krainer,Markus Haltmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learning-based method for image reconstruction from incomplete measurements (upsampling/inpainting) that uses multiple invariances to achieve full-supervised performance with less ground truth data, validated on photoacoustic microscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional supervised methods need fully sampled ground truth, while self-supervised methods rely on random sampling patterns. This work addresses fixed deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete coverage.

Method: Exploit multiple invariances of the underlying image distribution to overcome limitations of incomplete coverage in deterministic sampling patterns, achieving performance comparable to fully supervised approaches.

Result: Validated on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), showing competitive or superior results while requiring substantially less ground truth data.

Conclusion: The method enables high-quality image reconstruction from incomplete measurements using multiple invariances, reducing ground truth data requirements while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised approaches.

Abstract: We address the problem of image reconstruction from incomplete measurements,
encompassing both upsampling and inpainting, within a learning-based framework.
Conventional supervised approaches require fully sampled ground truth data,
while self-supervised methods allow incomplete ground truth but typically rely
on random sampling that, in expectation, covers the entire image. In contrast,
we consider fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete
coverage, even in expectation. To overcome this limitation, we exploit multiple
invariances of the underlying image distribution, which theoretically allows us
to achieve the same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches.
We validate our method on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic
microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results while requiring
substantially less ground truth data.

### [5] [Estimation of Segmental Longitudinal Strain in Transesophageal Echocardiography by Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02210)
*Anders Austlid Taskén,Thierry Judge,Erik Andreas Rye Berg,Jinyang Yu,Bjørnar Grenne,Frank Lindseth,Svend Aakhus,Pierre-Marc Jodoin,Nicolas Duchateau,Olivier Bernard,Gabriel Kiss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces autoStrain, the first automated pipeline for segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) estimation in transesophageal echocardiography using deep learning methods, comparing TeeFlow (RAFT optical flow) and TeeTracker (CoTracker point trajectory) approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current strain estimation techniques require significant manual intervention and expertise, limiting efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring purposes, particularly for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia.

Method: Used a simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to generate realistic synthetic TEE data with ground truth motion for training. Compared two deep learning approaches: TeeFlow (frame-to-frame dense predictions) and TeeTracker (long-sequence sparse predictions).

Result: TeeTracker outperformed TeeFlow with mean distance error of 0.65mm on synthetic data. Clinical validation on 16 patients showed autoStrain aligned with clinical references (mean difference 1.09%, limits of agreement -8.90% to 11.09%). Simulated ischemia improved model accuracy.

Conclusion: Integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an
important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in
particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques
for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,
limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring
purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for
SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning
(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL
approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense
frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point
trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.
  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly
accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to
generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with
ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our
evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a
mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.
  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation
with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean
difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).
Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of
the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that
integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the
precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

### [6] [Towards Selection of Large Multimodal Models as Engines for Burned-in Protected Health Information Detection in Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02014)
*Tuan Truong,Guillermo Jimenez Perez,Pedro Osorio,Matthias Lenga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Benchmarking of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for PHI detection in medical imaging shows superior OCR performance but inconsistent overall PHI detection accuracy improvements, with best results on complex imprint patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PHI detection methods rely on OCR with named entity recognition, but recent LMM advancements offer opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic analysis in medical imaging privacy protection.

Method: Systematic benchmarking of three LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Qwen 2.5 7B) using two pipeline configurations: text analysis only and OCR+semantic analysis integration.

Result: LMMs show superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) vs traditional models like EasyOCR, but OCR improvement doesn't consistently enhance PHI detection accuracy. Best performance gains on complex imprint patterns.

Conclusion: LMMs offer improved OCR but inconsistent PHI detection benefits; provide recommendations for LMM selection based on operational constraints and propose scalable modular deployment strategy.

Abstract: The detection of Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical imaging is
critical for safeguarding patient privacy and ensuring compliance with
regulatory frameworks. Traditional detection methodologies predominantly
utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models in conjunction with named
entity recognition. However, recent advancements in Large Multimodal Model
(LMM) present new opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic
analysis. In this study, we systematically benchmark three prominent closed and
open-sourced LMMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B, utilizing
two distinct pipeline configurations: one dedicated to text analysis alone and
another integrating both OCR and semantic analysis. Our results indicate that
LMM exhibits superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) compared to
conventional models like EasyOCR. However, this improvement in OCR performance
does not consistently correlate with enhanced overall PHI detection accuracy.
The strongest performance gains are observed on test cases with complex imprint
patterns. In scenarios where text regions are well readable with sufficient
contrast, and strong LMMs are employed for text analysis after OCR, different
pipeline configurations yield similar results. Furthermore, we provide
empirically grounded recommendations for LMM selection tailored to specific
operational constraints and propose a deployment strategy that leverages
scalable and modular infrastructure.

### [7] [StrengthSense: A Dataset of IMU Signals Capturing Everyday Strength-Demanding Activities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02027)
*Zeyu Yang,Clayton Souza Leite,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StrengthSense is an open IMU dataset capturing 11 strength-demanding activities and 2 non-strength activities from 29 subjects using 10 body-worn sensors, with video-validated annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing strength-demanding activities for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power using wearable sensors like IMUs.

Method: Collected data from 29 healthy subjects using 10 IMUs placed on limbs and torso, annotated using video recordings as references. Conducted comparative analysis between IMU-estimated joint angles and video-extracted angles for validation.

Result: Created a comprehensive open dataset covering 11 strength-demanding activities (sit-to-stand, climbing stairs, mopping, etc.) and 2 non-strength activities with technical validation showing accurate and reliable sensor data.

Conclusion: StrengthSense enables researchers and developers to advance human activity recognition algorithms and create fitness/health monitoring applications by providing validated IMU data for strength-demanding activities.

Abstract: Tracking strength-demanding activities with wearable sensors like IMUs is
crucial for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power. However, there
is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing these activities. To fill this
gap, we introduce \textit{StrengthSense}, an open dataset that encompasses IMU
signals capturing 11 strength-demanding activities, such as sit-to-stand,
climbing stairs, and mopping. For comparative purposes, the dataset also
includes 2 non-strength demanding activities. The dataset was collected from 29
healthy subjects utilizing 10 IMUs placed on limbs and the torso, and was
annotated using video recordings as references. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of the data collection, pre-processing, and technical
validation. We conducted a comparative analysis between the joint angles
estimated by IMUs and those directly extracted from video to verify the
accuracy and reliability of the sensor data. Researchers and developers can
utilize \textit{StrengthSense} to advance the development of human activity
recognition algorithms, create fitness and health monitoring applications, and
more.

### [8] [Text-VQA Aug: Pipelined Harnessing of Large Multimodal Models for Automated Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02046)
*Soham Joshi,Shwet Kamal Mishra,Viswanath Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an automated pipeline for synthesizing large-scale text-VQA datasets using OCR, ROI detection, caption generation, and question generation models to create faithful QA pairs from scene text in images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human annotation for text-VQA datasets is tedious and challenging. With advances in foundation models and OCR systems, there's a need for automated pipelines that can scale with scene text data availability.

Method: Uses OCR detection/recognition (text spotting), ROI detection, caption generation, and question generation models in a streamlined pipeline to automatically synthesize and validate QA pairs from images containing scene text.

Result: Successfully created a large-scale text-VQA dataset with approximately 72K QA pairs based on around 44K images, demonstrating the pipeline's scalability and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enables automated creation of large-scale text-VQA datasets, overcoming the limitations of manual annotation and scaling with available scene text data.

Abstract: Creation of large-scale databases for Visual Question Answering tasks
pertaining to the text data in a scene (text-VQA) involves skilful human
annotation, which is tedious and challenging. With the advent of foundation
models that handle vision and language modalities, and with the maturity of OCR
systems, it is the need of the hour to establish an end-to-end pipeline that
can synthesize Question-Answer (QA) pairs based on scene-text from a given
image. We propose a pipeline for automated synthesis for text-VQA dataset that
can produce faithful QA pairs, and which scales up with the availability of
scene text data. Our proposed method harnesses the capabilities of multiple
models and algorithms involving OCR detection and recognition (text spotting),
region of interest (ROI) detection, caption generation, and question
generation. These components are streamlined into a cohesive pipeline to
automate the synthesis and validation of QA pairs. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first pipeline proposed to automatically synthesize and
validate a large-scale text-VQA dataset comprising around 72K QA pairs based on
around 44K images.

*Yue Yang,Fabian Necker,Christoph Leuze,Michelle Chen,Andrey Finegersh,Jake Lee,Vasu Divi,Bruce Daniel,Brian Hargreaves,Jie Ying Wu,Fred M Baik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A depth-only, markerless AR registration pipeline on HoloLens 2 achieved ~3-4 mm median error in live surgical settings for small/low-curvature anatomies without fiducials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop and clinically evaluate a markerless AR registration method for surgical guidance that works on small or low-curvature anatomies without requiring fiducial markers.

Method: Used HoloLens 2 with AHAT depth tracking aligned to CT-derived skin meshes via depth-bias correction, human-in-the-loop initialization, and global/local registration. Validated with AR-tracked tools and performed intraoperative trials on feet, ear, and leg.

Result: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement (0.78-1.20 mm RMSE). Clinical median errors: 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm coverage of 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86% respectively.

Conclusion: The depth-only markerless AR pipeline achieved clinically relevant accuracy (~3-4 mm median error) for moderate-risk surgical tasks, improving clinical readiness of markerless AR guidance through human-guided initialization and global-to-local registration.

Abstract: Purpose: In this paper, we develop and clinically evaluate a depth-only,
markerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline on a head-mounted
display, and assess accuracy across small or low-curvature anatomies in
real-life operative settings. Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd
Tracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)
depth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)
global and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by
comparing "skin-to-bone" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot
models, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target
trials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap
harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per
trial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced
and CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,
1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by
anatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm
coverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed
significantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,
markerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,
and lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical
clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization
plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or
low-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR
guidance.

### [10] [From Instance Segmentation to 3D Growth Trajectory Reconstruction in Planktonic Foraminifera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02142)
*Huahua Lin,Xiaohao Cai,Mark Nixon,James M. Mulqueeney,Thomas H. G. Ezard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated pipeline for reconstructing 3D growth trajectories of planktonic foraminifera from CT scans using instance segmentation and chamber ordering algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation of foraminifera chambers is time-consuming and subjective, limiting large-scale ecological studies. Automated tracing of chamber growth from imaging data remains largely unexplored.

Method: End-to-end pipeline integrating instance segmentation (computer vision technique) with dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically reconstruct 3D growth trajectories from high-resolution CT scans.

Result: Pipeline substantially reduces manual effort while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Chamber-ordering algorithm remains robust even under partial segmentation, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental trajectories.

Conclusion: First fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth analysis, establishing foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological studies.

Abstract: Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate
chambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present
environmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory
provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation
under changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from
imaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying
heavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and
subjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates
instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in
foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically
reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed
tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple
instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of
the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order
reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort
while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation
models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel
fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm
remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental
trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first
fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth
analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological
studies.

### [11] [Fast Measuring Pavement Crack Width by Cascading Principal Component Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02144)
*Zhicheng Wang,Junbiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cascaded PCA and Robust PCA framework for accurate crack width measurement from pavement images, addressing complex crack morphology and enabling rapid measurements from arbitrary pixel locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate crack width quantification is crucial for pavement structural assessment and maintenance, but current methods struggle with complex crack boundaries and lack rapid measurement capabilities from arbitrary locations.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) initial crack segmentation using detection algorithms, 2) PCA for orientation axis of quasi-parallel cracks, 3) Robust PCA for Main Propagation Axis of irregular cracks.

Result: Superior performance in computational efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques across three public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed cascaded PCA/RPCA framework effectively addresses limitations in crack width measurement, providing efficient and accurate quantification for comprehensive pavement condition evaluation.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of pavement crack width plays a pivotal role in
assessing structural integrity and guiding maintenance interventions. However,
achieving precise crack width measurements presents significant challenges due
to: (1) the complex, non-uniform morphology of crack boundaries, which limits
the efficacy of conventional approaches, and (2) the demand for rapid
measurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations to facilitate
comprehensive pavement condition evaluation. To overcome these limitations,
this study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from
digital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1)
initial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a
binary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for
quasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation
Axis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA. Comprehensive evaluations
were conducted across three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the
proposed approach achieves superior performance in both computational
efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art
techniques.

*Mehdi Sefidgar Dilmaghani,Waseem Shariff,Cian Ryan,Joe Lemley,Peter Corcoran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Autonomous bias tuning mechanism for event cameras using CNN to detect and mitigate flicker effects across 25-500 Hz range, improving face detection performance in various lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address flicker effects caused by rapid light intensity variations that degrade event camera performance in diverse environments, without relying on additional hardware or software filters.

Method: Uses simple CNN to identify flicker in spatial space and dynamically adjusts event camera bias settings to minimize flicker impact, tested with face detector framework under well-lit and low-light conditions.

Result: Significant improvements: enhanced YOLO confidence for face detection, increased percentage of frames with detected faces, and 38.2% (well-lit) / 53.6% (low-light) reduction in average gradient indicating flicker presence.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential to significantly improve event camera functionality in adverse lighting scenarios through autonomous bias tuning.

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating flicker effects caused by rapid variations in
light intensity is critical for enhancing the performance of event cameras in
diverse environments. This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism
for tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a
wide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
additional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages
the event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional
Neural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial
space and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The
efficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector
framework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across
various frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:
enhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased
percentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,
which serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,
decreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in
low-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach
to significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of
adverse lighting scenarios.

Motivation: To address the complex demands of GVQA which requires multimodal reasoning, visual grounding, and temporal tracking of objects in videos.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: (1) Video Reasoning & QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding, (3) Tracking, with key innovation of trigger moment from CORTEX prompt to identify most visible object frames.

Result: Achieved HOTA score of 0.4968, significantly improving over previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.

Conclusion: The proposed framework with trigger moment concept effectively addresses GVQA challenges and demonstrates substantial performance gains in object grounding and tracking.

Abstract: In this technical report, we introduce a framework to address Grounded Video
Question Answering (GVQA) task for the ICCV 2025 Perception Test Challenge. The
GVQA task demands robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over
video content, grounding the resulting answers visually, and tracking the
referenced objects temporally. To achieve this capability, our proposed
approach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video
Reasoning \& QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key
contribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed
CORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object
to serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve
the HOTA score of 0.4968, which marks a significant improvement over the
previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.

TL;DR: MM-UNet is a novel deep learning architecture for retinal vessel segmentation that incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers and Reverse Selective State Guidance modules to improve segmentation of thin, branching vascular structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinal vessel segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis but challenging due to the extremely thin and branching nature of vasculature, with significant morphological variations across images that affect segmentation precision and robustness.

Method: Proposes MM-UNet with Morph Mamba Convolution layers that replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception, and Reverse Selective State Guidance modules that integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.

Result: Achieves superior performance on two public datasets with F1-score gains of 1.64% on DRIVE and 1.25% on STARE compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: MM-UNet demonstrates effectiveness and advancement in retinal vessel segmentation through its novel architectural components that address the unique challenges of vascular structure segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a
wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular
diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal
vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the
quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature
differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it
consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology
varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges
to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose
MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel
segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which
replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception
through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective
State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space
modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.
Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in
segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves
F1-score gains of 1.64 $\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its
effectiveness and advancement. The project code is public via

TL;DR: A language-enhanced generative model synthesizes realistic amyloid-beta PET images from blood biomarkers and MRI, enabling accurate Alzheimer's diagnosis without expensive PET scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alzheimer's disease diagnosis relies on expensive and inaccessible amyloid-beta PET imaging. This study aims to predict PET spatial patterns from more accessible blood biomarkers and MRI scans.

Method: Developed a language-enhanced generative model using large language models and multimodal fusion to synthesize PET images from blood biomarkers and T1-weighted MRI scans of 566 participants.

Result: Synthetic PET images closely matched real PET scans (SSIM=0.920, Pearson's r=0.955). Diagnostic accuracy was 0.80 compared to real PET. Synthetic PET-based model (AUC=0.78) outperformed MRI-only (0.68) and blood biomarker-only (0.73) models.

Conclusion: The language-enhanced generative model successfully synthesizes realistic PET images, improving Alzheimer's diagnostic workflow by enhancing the utility of MRI and blood biomarkers for amyloid spatial pattern assessment.

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta
positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and
limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns
can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We
collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566
participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language
model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET
images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic
consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic
pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in
both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns
(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show
high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic
PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET
synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)
outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while
combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).
Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt
engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes
realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial
pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's
disease.

*Jiajia Li,Keyi Zhu,Qianwen Zhang,Dong Chen,Qi Sun,Zhaojian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel object-centric 3D reconstruction framework using SAM-2 and alpha channel masking for clean strawberry plant reconstructions, enabling automated plant trait estimation with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and destructive. Current 3DGS applications reconstruct entire scenes including background elements, which introduces noise, increases computational costs, and complicates trait analysis.

Method: Proposed an object-centric 3D reconstruction framework with preprocessing pipeline using Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean strawberry plant reconstructions, then used DBSCAN clustering and PCA for automated trait estimation.

Result: The method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and efficiency, producing more accurate geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time.

Conclusion: This approach offers a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry plant phenotyping, enabling automatic estimation of important plant traits like plant height and canopy width.

Abstract: Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United
States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for
approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays
a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits
such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional
plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often
destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful
frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of
multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable
non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their
promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct
the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,
increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction
framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment
Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean
strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate
geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With
a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate
important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN
clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show
that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry
plant phenotyping.

*Yiqin Zhao,Tian Guo*

TL;DR: Foundation models can significantly improve mobile sparse sensing by enhancing geometry-aware image warping and enabling accurate 3D scene reconstruction, overcoming traditional trade-offs between sensing quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile sensing systems face fundamental trade-offs between quality and efficiency due to computational and power constraints. Existing sparse sensing methods often suffer from reduced accuracy due to missing information across space and time.

Method: Investigated whether foundation models can improve mobile sparse sensing, using real-world mobile AR data to evaluate geometry-aware image warping and 3D scene reconstruction capabilities.

Result: Foundation models offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping and demonstrate leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction, showing scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing.

Conclusion: Foundation models show promise for transforming mobile sparse sensing by improving accuracy while maintaining efficiency, though challenges remain in their integration into mobile systems.

Abstract: Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between
sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and
other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a
subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance
under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer
from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces
uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether
foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using
real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models
offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central
technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore,
our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing
and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our
study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of
integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.

*Delin Ma,Menghui Zhou,Jun Qi,Yun Yang,Po Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A collaborative attention and consistency-guided fusion framework for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using MRI and PET neuroimaging that addresses modality-specific features and distributional differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial, and while multimodal neuroimaging fusion shows promise, existing methods overlook modality-specific features and suffer from distributional differences between MRI and PET data that degrade performance.

Method: Proposes a framework with learnable parameter representation block to handle missing modality data, shared and modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific features, and consistency-guided mechanism to align latent distributions across modalities.

Result: Experimental results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate superior diagnostic performance compared to existing fusion strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed collaborative attention and consistency-guided fusion framework effectively addresses modality-specific feature preservation and distribution alignment, achieving improved Alzheimer's disease diagnosis performance.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its
early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on
multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising
results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most
existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while
overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In
addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead
to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and
Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The
proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to
compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and
modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific
representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to
explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental
results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior
diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.

*Hao Li,Daiwei Lu,Jesse d'Almeida,Dilara Isik,Ehsan Khodapanah Aghdam,Nick DiSanto,Ayberk Acar,Susheela Sharma,Jie Ying Wu,Robert J. Webster III,Ipek Oguz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A latent feature alignment method for monocular depth estimation in endoscopic videos that reduces domain gap between synthetic and real images using adversarial learning and directional feature consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obtaining absolute depth from endoscopy cameras is difficult, limiting supervised learning on real endoscopic images. Current domain adaptation methods still leave a domain gap between real and translated synthetic images.

Method: Uses latent feature alignment with adversarial learning and directional feature consistency to learn domain-invariant features. The depth network takes both translated synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input.

Result: Achieves superior performance on both absolute and relative depth metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods, with consistent improvements across various backbones and pretrained weights.

Conclusion: The proposed latent feature alignment method effectively reduces domain gap and improves absolute depth estimation for endoscopic medical robotics applications.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a critical task to guide autonomous
medical robots. However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy
camera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of
depth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain
adaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the
style of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated
images with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains
between real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a
latent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by
reducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central
airway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on
the depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated
synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent
domain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature
consistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway
phantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to
state-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on
both absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results
across various backbones and pretrained weights. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HTSC-CIF framework addresses three key challenges in Medical Report Generation through hierarchical task decomposition: low-level medical entity alignment, mid-level cross-modal alignment, and high-level causal intervention to reduce biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MRG models face three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor text-visual entity alignment, and spurious correlations from cross-modal biases. Previous work only addressed single challenges.

Method: Hierarchical task decomposition with three levels: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features with spatial locations; 2) Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling and Masked Image Modeling for cross-modal alignment; 3) High-level: cross-modal causal intervention via front-door intervention to reduce confounders.

Result: Extensive experiments show HTSC-CIF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MRG methods, confirming the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed HTSC-CIF framework successfully addresses all three key challenges in MRG through hierarchical decomposition and cross-modal causal intervention, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a key part of modern medical diagnostics,
as it automatically generates reports from radiological images to reduce
radiologists' burden. However, reliable MRG models for lesion description face
three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor
text-visual entity embedding alignment, and spurious correlations from
cross-modal biases. Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this
paper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach,
proposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into
low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features
with spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2)
Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling
(images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a
cross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce
confounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm
HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA)
MRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.

*Giorgos Sfikas,Konstantina Nikolaidou,Foteini Papadopoulou,George Retsinas,Anastasios L. Kesidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores using Euler angles parameterization for probabilistic pose estimation with Normalizing Flows, arguing that despite their shortcomings, Euler angles can lead to useful models compared to more complex parameterizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object pose estimation often requires probabilistic outputs when pose is ambiguous due to sensor constraints, projection limitations, or object symmetries. A single point estimate may not be sufficient in these cases.

Method: The authors use Euler angles parameterization as a basis for a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation, comparing it against more complex parameterizations.

Result: The paper finds that Euler angles, despite their known limitations, can produce useful probabilistic pose estimation models in various aspects.

Conclusion: Euler angles parameterization remains a viable option for building probabilistic pose estimation models with Normalizing Flows, offering benefits compared to more complex parameterizations despite their shortcomings.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a task that is of central importance in 3D Computer
Vision. Given a target image and a canonical pose, a single point estimate may
very often be sufficient; however, a probabilistic pose output is related to a
number of benefits when pose is not unambiguous due to sensor and projection
constraints or inherent object symmetries. With this paper, we explore the
usefulness of using the well-known Euler angles parameterisation as a basis for
a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. Isomorphic to spatial rotation,
3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the
context of parameter estimation. We explore the idea that Euler angles, despite
their shortcomings, may lead to useful models in a number of aspects, compared
to a model built on a more complex parameterisation.

TL;DR: SAIL-RL is a reinforcement learning framework that improves multimodal LLMs' reasoning by teaching them when and how to think using dual rewards for reasoning quality and adaptive thinking strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches suffer from outcome-only supervision that rewards correct answers without ensuring sound reasoning, and uniform thinking strategies that cause overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones.

Method: Uses dual reward system: Thinking Reward evaluates reasoning quality (factual grounding, logical coherence, answer consistency) and Judging Reward adaptively determines whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate.

Result: Improves reasoning and multimodal understanding benchmarks at 4B and 8B scales, achieves competitive performance against GPT-4o, and substantially reduces hallucinations.

Conclusion: Establishes SAIL-RL as a principled framework for building more reliable and adaptive multimodal large language models.

Abstract: We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework
that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited
by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring
sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to
overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL
addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward,
which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence,
and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines
whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the
state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal
understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive
performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and
substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework
for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at

Motivation: To improve Handwritten Mathematical Expression recognition by effectively capturing spatial relationships between symbols through graph-based modeling.

Method: Uses deep BLSTM network for symbol segmentation, recognition and spatial relation classification to form initial graph. Then applies 2D-CFG parser to generate spatial relations and GNN-based link prediction to refine structure by removing unnecessary connections.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing promising performance in HME structure recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN-based method effectively recognizes Handwritten Mathematical Expressions by modeling them as graphs and refining spatial relationships through neural network processing.

Abstract: We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach for Handwritten
Mathematical Expression (HME) recognition by modeling HMEs as graphs, where
nodes represent symbols and edges capture spatial dependencies. A deep BLSTM
network is used for symbol segmentation, recognition, and spatial relation
classification, forming an initial primitive graph. A 2D-CFG parser then
generates all possible spatial relations, while the GNN-based link prediction
model refines the structure by removing unnecessary connections, ultimately
forming the Symbol Label Graph. Experimental results demonstrate the

TL;DR: Cycle-Sync is a robust global framework for camera pose estimation that uses modified message-passing least squares with cycle consistency to achieve state-of-the-art performance without bundle adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust camera pose estimation framework that achieves global optimality without relying on bundle adjustment, while providing strong theoretical guarantees and practical performance.

Method: Adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) for camera location estimation, emphasizes cycle-consistent information, redefines cycle consistencies using estimated distances, incorporates Welsch-type robust loss, and adds outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery.

Result: Establishes strongest known deterministic exact-recovery guarantee for camera location estimation, achieves lowest known sample complexity using only cycle consistency, and outperforms leading pose estimators including full structure-from-motion pipelines with bundle adjustment on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Cycle-Sync provides a robust, global framework for camera pose estimation that eliminates the need for bundle adjustment while achieving superior performance through cycle consistency and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We introduce Cycle-Sync, a robust and global framework for estimating camera
poses (both rotations and locations). Our core innovation is a location solver
that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for
group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to
emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using
estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type
robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery
guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone
-- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest
sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce
a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery,
and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation
synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently
outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion
pipelines with bundle adjustment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAFD-CC is a novel OOD detection method that performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights, extracting both positively and negatively correlated features to refine decision boundaries and improve discriminative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc OOD detection methods overlook the inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for effective OOD detection. This limitation needs to be addressed to improve reliability and robustness in real-world applications.

Method: 1) Global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights to extract positively correlated features (for ID/OOD boundary refinement) and negatively correlated features (to suppress false positives). 2) Adaptive fusion of decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for comprehensive OOD detection.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong generalization ability compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GAFD-CC effectively addresses the limitation of existing methods by leveraging the correlation between features and logits, achieving superior OOD detection performance through feature decoupling and confidence calibration.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is paramount to ensuring the reliability
and robustness of learning models in real-world applications. Existing post-hoc
OOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and
logits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the
inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for
effective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware
Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to
refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it
performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This
involves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights
to decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical
information: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution
(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress
false positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses
these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for
comprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong
generalization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: Current portable physiological monitoring methods have accessibility limitations and reliability challenges. Video-based photoplethysmography on smartphones faces issues with motion artifacts, lighting variations, and single-view constraints, with limited validation on cardiovascular patients and no open datasets for cross-device accuracy.

Method: Created M3PD dataset with synchronized dual-view videos (facial and fingertip) captured simultaneously via front and rear smartphone cameras. Proposed F3Mamba model that fuses facial and fingertip views using Mamba-based temporal modeling for improved heart-rate estimation.

Result: F3Mamba reduces heart-rate error by 21.9 to 30.2 percent compared to existing single-view baselines, demonstrating improved robustness in challenging real-world scenarios. The dataset includes 60 participants with 47 cardiovascular patients.

Conclusion: The dual-view approach with Mamba-based fusion significantly enhances the reliability of mobile photoplethysmography for cardiovascular monitoring, addressing key limitations of single-view methods and providing a valuable open dataset for future research.

Abstract: Portable physiological monitoring is essential for early detection and
management of cardiovascular disease, but current methods often require
specialized equipment that limits accessibility or impose impractical postures
that patients cannot maintain. Video-based photoplethysmography on smartphones
offers a convenient noninvasive alternative, yet it still faces reliability
challenges caused by motion artifacts, lighting variations, and single-view
constraints. Few studies have demonstrated reliable application to
cardiovascular patients, and no widely used open datasets exist for
cross-device accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce the M3PD
dataset, the first publicly available dual-view mobile photoplethysmography
dataset, comprising synchronized facial and fingertip videos captured
simultaneously via front and rear smartphone cameras from 60 participants
(including 47 cardiovascular patients). Building on this dual-view setting, we
further propose F3Mamba, which fuses the facial and fingertip views through
Mamba-based temporal modeling. The model reduces heart-rate error by 21.9 to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs are constrained to discrete linguistic tokens, which bottlenecks the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual perception. There's a gap between discrete language processing and continuous visual understanding.

Method: Uses an iterative reasoning cycle with Latent Q-Former (LQ-Former) as dynamic reasoning engine, token selection for salient regions, and multi-task training with contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction.

Result: Improves accuracy and token efficiency over baselines. 1.5B model competes with 7B-9B models on benchmarks. 7B version remains competitive with SOTA. Latent space captures interpretable reasoning patterns.

Conclusion: CoCoVa successfully bridges the representational gap between discrete language processing and continuous visual understanding through continuous cross-modal reasoning.

Abstract: In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and
beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world
in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain
constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic
tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual
perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous
Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that
leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.
The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent
Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a
chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this
process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual
regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain
grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines
contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment
between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.
Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong
baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B
models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains
competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that
learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,
highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between
discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RxnCaption framework converts chemical reaction diagram parsing into an image captioning task using Large Vision-Language Models, achieving state-of-the-art performance through a novel BBox and Index as Visual Prompt strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemical reaction data in papers exist as images that are not machine-readable, limiting their use for training AI models in chemistry research.

Method: Reformulates chemical reaction parsing as image captioning using LVLMs with BIVP strategy - pre-drawing molecular bounding boxes and indices using MolYOLO detector to create visual prompts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics, constructs RxnCaption-11k dataset (10x larger than prior benchmarks), significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model design.

Conclusion: The framework, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry.

Abstract: Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in
chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images
within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training
machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the
RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP).
Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing
process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as
Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,
MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the
input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language
description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy
significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model
design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude
larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset
across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our
method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from
chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will
release data, models, and code on GitHub.

*Leon Schwarzer,Matthias Zeller,Daniel Casado Herraez,Simon Dierl,Michael Heidingsfeld,Cyrill Stachniss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised moving object segmentation for radar point clouds using contrastive learning with cluster refinement to reduce annotation costs and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar sensors provide direct Doppler velocity measurements for single-scan moving object segmentation, but radar point clouds are sparse and noisy, making supervised learning annotation tedious and expensive.

Method: Two-step approach: contrastive self-supervised representation learning with cluster-based loss and dynamic points removal, followed by supervised fine-tuning with limited annotated data.

Result: Method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning and boosts state-of-the-art performance through self-supervised pretraining.

Conclusion: Self-supervised pretraining enables effective moving object segmentation in sparse radar data while reducing annotation requirements.

Abstract: Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous
mobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness
of subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of
camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often
introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal
sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this
problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler
velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.
However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation
for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and
cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of
self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point
clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised
representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited
amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss
function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain
the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our
method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting
state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.

### [30] [A Novel Grouping-Based Hybrid Color Correction Algorithm for Color Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02397)
*Kuo-Liang Chung,Ting-Chung Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A grouping-based hybrid color correction algorithm for color point clouds that adaptively partitions points into proximity groups and applies different correction methods to each group.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Color consistency correction is fundamental for 3D rendering and compression, but most existing methods focus on color images rather than point clouds.

Method: Estimates overlapping rate between source and target point clouds, partitions target points into proximity groups (2 or 3 groups based on overlap rate), and applies different correction methods: K-nearest neighbors bilateral interpolation for close proximity, joint KBI and histogram equalization for moderate proximity, and histogram equalization for distant proximity.

Result: Tested on 1086 color point cloud pairs and demonstrated superior color consistency correction compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed grouping-based hybrid approach effectively handles color consistency correction for point clouds with adaptive grouping and specialized correction methods for different proximity levels.

Abstract: Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet
important task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most
previous color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.
The purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color
correction algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating
the overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and
then adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close
proximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,
namely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated
overlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target
points in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method
is proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the
histogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a
histogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,
we discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our
algorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm
has been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the
state-of-the-art methods. The C++ source code of our algorithm can be accessed
from the website: https://github.com/ivpml84079/Point-cloud-color-correction.

### [31] [Purrturbed but Stable: Human-Cat Invariant Representations Across CNNs, ViTs and Self-Supervised ViTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02404)
*Arya Shah,Vaibhav Tripathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised Vision Transformers (DINO) show the highest representational alignment between feline and human visual systems, outperforming supervised ViTs, CNNs, and windowed transformers in cross-species visual representation similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how feline ocular specializations (vertically elongated pupils for ambush predation) manifest in visual representations compared to humans, and to identify which neural network architectures best bridge species-specific visual statistics.

Method: A unified frozen-encoder benchmark using layer-wise Centered Kernel Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis across various architectures: CNNs, supervised ViTs, windowed transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), with additional distributional and stability tests.

Result: DINO ViT-B/16 achieved the highest alignment (mean CKA-RBF ≈0.814, mean CKA-linear ≈0.745, mean RSA ≈0.698), peaking at early blocks. Supervised ViTs showed competitive CKA but weaker geometric correspondence. CNNs were strong baselines but below plain ViTs, while windowed transformers underperformed.

Conclusion: Self-supervision combined with ViT inductive biases produces representational geometries that better align feline and human visual systems than CNNs and windowed transformers, providing neuroscientific hypotheses about cross-species visual convergence.

Abstract: Cats and humans differ in ocular anatomy. Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic
cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how
such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains
incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that
quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild,
across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed
transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel
Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with
additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across
models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF
$\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\approx0.698$),
peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces
early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs
are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO
(e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\approx0.47$ at
block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and
representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on
alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating
architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate
that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational
geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely
used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific
hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge. We
release our code and dataset for reference and reproducibility.

*Wenyang Wei,Yang yang,Xixi Jia,Xiangchu Feng,Weiwei Wang,Renzhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IllumFlow combines conditional Rectified Flow with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement, separating illumination and reflectance optimization to handle lighting variations and noise effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of low-light image enhancement, including wide illumination variations and complex noise, by leveraging the complementary strengths of Retinex theory and flow-based modeling.

Method: Decomposes images into reflectance and illumination components using Retinex theory, uses conditional rectified flow for illumination modeling, and employs a denoising network with flow-derived augmentation for reflectance noise removal.

Result: Achieves superior quantitative and qualitative performance in low-light enhancement and exposure correction compared to existing methods, with precise illumination adaptation and customizable brightness enhancement.

Conclusion: IllumFlow provides an effective framework for low-light image enhancement that naturally handles illumination variations while preserving color fidelity through its synergistic combination of Retinex theory and conditional rectified flow.

Abstract: We present IllumFlow, a novel framework that synergizes conditional Rectified
Flow (CRF) with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement (LLIE). Our
model addresses low-light enhancement through separate optimization of
illumination and reflectance components, effectively handling both lighting
variations and noise. Specifically, we first decompose an input image into
reflectance and illumination components following Retinex theory. To model the
wide dynamic range of illumination variations in low-light images, we propose a
conditional rectified flow framework that represents illumination changes as a
continuous flow field. While complex noise primarily resides in the reflectance
component, we introduce a denoising network, enhanced by flow-derived data
augmentation, to remove reflectance noise and chromatic aberration while
preserving color fidelity. IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation
across lighting conditions while naturally supporting customizable brightness
enhancement. Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure
correction demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over
existing methods.

Result: Created ChartM³ dataset with 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs, plus 2,871 evaluation samples. SFT and RL experiments show significant improvement in reasoning capabilities and cross-domain generalization, enabling smaller models to match larger models' performance.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively addresses limitations in complex chart understanding by generating high-quality datasets that enhance MLLMs' reasoning capabilities and enable practical performance assessment.

Abstract: Complex chart understanding tasks demand advanced visual recognition and
reasoning capabilities from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,
current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and
computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications.
This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for
systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these
limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to
retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT)
strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions,
thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations.
Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data
quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and
multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along
with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance
assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)
experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning
capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex
chart comprehension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep learning models for crop-weed segmentation requires large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real agricultural fields. Synthetic data can help but faces the challenge of the sim-to-real gap.

Method: Developed a procedural generation pipeline using Blender to create synthetic crop-weed images with diverse conditions (plant growth, weed density, lighting, camera angles) and benchmarked state-of-the-art segmentation models on both synthetic and real datasets.

Result: Training on synthetic images achieved a 10% sim-to-real gap, surpassing previous methods. Synthetic data showed better generalization in cross-domain scenarios compared to real datasets.

Conclusion: Synthetic agricultural datasets have strong potential and support hybrid training strategies for more efficient model development in agricultural robotics.

Abstract: Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for
agricultural weeding robots. However, training deep learning models requires
large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic
data can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images
remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural
generation of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated
datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and
camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on
synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our
results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of
10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data
demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in
cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic
agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model
training.

Abstract: Video Understanding, Scene Interpretation and Commonsense Reasoning are
highly challenging tasks enabling the interpretation of visual information,
allowing agents to perceive, interact with and make rational decisions in its

Motivation: To address challenges in satellite image inpainting for very high-resolution datasets, overcoming limitations of existing methods that require extensive retraining or have high computational overhead.

Method: Uses Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models with Latent Space Conditioning and Explicit Propagation for forward-backward fusion.

Result: KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing scalable high-performance solution that balances efficiency and flexibility.

Conclusion: KAO offers an efficient and accurate approach to satellite image inpainting that outperforms existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Satellite image inpainting is a crucial task in remote sensing, where
accurately restoring missing or occluded regions is essential for robust image
analysis. In this paper, we propose KAO, a novel framework that utilizes
Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models for satellite image
inpainting. KAO is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by
very high-resolution (VHR) satellite datasets, such as DeepGlobe and the
Massachusetts Roads Dataset. Unlike existing methods that rely on
preconditioned models requiring extensive retraining or postconditioned models
with significant computational overhead, KAO introduces a Latent Space
Conditioning approach, optimizing a compact latent space to achieve efficient
and accurate inpainting. Furthermore, we incorporate Explicit Propagation into
the diffusion process, facilitating forward-backward fusion, which improves the
stability and precision of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that
KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing a
scalable, high-performance solution that balances the efficiency of
preconditioned models with the flexibility of postconditioned models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MVAFormer, a transformer-based multi-view action recognition method for spatio-temporal action recognition that preserves spatial information and outperforms baselines by 4.4 F-measure points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view action recognition methods focus on single action recognition from entire videos and cannot handle the spatio-temporal action recognition setting where each person's action is recognized sequentially.

Method: Introduces a transformer-based cooperation module that uses feature maps instead of embedding vectors to preserve spatial information, and divides self-attention for same and different views to model relationships effectively.

Result: MVAFormer outperforms comparison baselines by approximately 4.4 points on F-measure in experiments using a newly collected dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed MVAFormer successfully addresses multi-view action recognition in the spatio-temporal setting through effective view cooperation while preserving spatial information.

Abstract: Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple
camera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this
task, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by
combining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising
cooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods
focus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire
video, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action
recognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized
sequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action
recognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we
introduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast
to previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial
information, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in
the STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our
module, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model
the relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments
using a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the
comparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.

Motivation: To address the limitation of existing techniques that rely heavily on synthetic datasets and small-scale real-world datasets, which limits realism and generalization in object-centric inverse rendering and relighting.

Method: Captured 765 real-world objects using 35 DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, providing well-calibrated camera parameters, object masks, photometric surface normals, and diffuse albedo.

Result: Created a comprehensive dataset with large-scale coverage of real objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations, establishing the first comprehensive real-world object-centric benchmark.

Conclusion: OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating next-generation inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data, and will be publicly released to advance research in this field.

Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of
765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set
of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in
object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have
shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic
datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking,
which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse
offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real
objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.
Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,
spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35
DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the
simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we
provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric
surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct
an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world
object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We
believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next
generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data.
The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly

TL;DR: A cross-view UAV localization framework using object detection and graph neural networks for accurate localization in GNSS-denied areas, achieving strong performance on heterogeneous aerial image matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of UAV localization in GNSS-denied areas where satellite-based methods fail, and overcome limitations of existing approaches that suffer from misalignment, content loss, and limited realism in cross-view image matching.

Method: Leverages modern object detection to extract salient instances from UAV and satellite images, integrates graph neural network to reason about inter-image and intra-image node relationships, and uses fine-grained graph-based node-similarity metric for retrieval and localization.

Result: Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show the method effectively handles heterogeneous appearance differences, generalizes well, and achieves strong retrieval and localization performance, even applicable to larger modality gaps like infrared-visible image matching.

Conclusion: The proposed object detection and graph neural network framework provides an effective solution for cross-view UAV localization, overcoming limitations of traditional methods and demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across different modalities.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial
for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,
satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents
a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object
detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,
heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual
localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are
extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is
estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because
publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches
recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these
datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain
differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,
or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,
content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object
detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite
images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and
intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based
node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization
performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that
our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and
generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,
such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available
at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/ODGNNLoc.git.

introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k
high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos
covering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data
are annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding
boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications
such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers
clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data
quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world
scenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks,
including object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and
vision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset
to advance fire-related research and support the development of intelligent
safety systems. We release DetectiumFire to promote broader exploration of fire
understanding in the AI community. The dataset is available at

### [41] [Adapting General-Purpose Foundation Models for X-ray Ptychography in Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02503)
*Robinson Umeike,Neil Getty,Yin Xiangyu,Yi Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PtychoBench benchmark evaluates domain adaptation strategies (SFT vs ICL) for foundation models in ptychographic analysis, finding optimal strategy depends on task modality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the best domain adaptation strategy for foundation models in specialized scientific microscopy workflows, as general-purpose models need effective specialization for scientific tasks.

Method: Created PtychoBench multi-modal benchmark to systematically compare Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies for visual artifact detection (VLMs) and textual parameter recommendation (LLMs) in data-scarce conditions.

Result: For visual tasks, SFT and ICL are complementary (best Micro-F1: 0.728). For textual tasks, ICL on large base models is superior (Micro-F1: 0.847 vs SFT's 0.839). Context-aware prompting works best, with consistent contextual interference in fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: Optimal specialization path depends on task modality, providing a framework for developing effective science-based AI systems.

Abstract: The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where
foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for
specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation
strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new
multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this
benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies
on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter
recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that
the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT
and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by
context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of
0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the
superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a
powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm
the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual
interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked
against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer
key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our
benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for
developing more effective science-based agentic systems.

### [42] [ESA: Energy-Based Shot Assembly Optimization for Automatic Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02505)
*Yaosen Chen,Wei Wang,Xuming Wen,Han Yang,Yanru Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An energy-based optimization method for video shot assembly that learns from reference videos to automatically arrange shots while preserving artistic style and narrative coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional shot assembly requires experienced editors, and current automated methods fail to capture unique artistic expression. The goal is to enable automated video editing that maintains creative style.

Method: Uses visual-semantic matching between LLM-generated scripts and video libraries, extracts shot attributes (size, motion, semantics), employs energy-based models to score sequences based on reference styles, and combines syntax rules for optimization.

Result: The method automates shot arrangement according to specific logic and narrative requirements while learning assembly styles from reference videos, creating coherent visual sequences.

Conclusion: The proposed system enables users without video editing experience to create visually compelling videos by automating shot assembly while preserving artistic expression learned from reference materials.

Abstract: Shot assembly is a crucial step in film production and video editing,
involving the sequencing and arrangement of shots to construct a narrative,
convey information, or evoke emotions. Traditionally, this process has been
manually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video
editing technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often
fail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly.To
address this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for
video shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching
between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to
obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we
segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such
as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models
to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their
alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization
by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the
assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the
arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic,
narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style
of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual
expression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience
can create visually compelling videos. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline for generating automated natural language reports for mobile robotics using local multi-modal sensors, enabling privacy-preserving edge computing without external services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to evaluate large amounts of heterogeneous data from AI-enabled robotics in critical applications like autonomous driving and service robotics, requiring automated reporting to facilitate system evaluation and acceptance.

Method: Proposed a pipeline using local models deployed on edge computing devices with multi-modal sensors, eliminating the need for external services to preserve privacy.

Result: Evaluated implementation on diverse datasets spanning indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing both quantitative and qualitative evaluation results with example reports available in public repository.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline successfully generates automated reports for mobile robotics while maintaining privacy through local edge computing, demonstrating applicability across multiple domains.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning enable hardware-based cognitive systems,
that is, mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular with
integrated Artificial Intelligence, to interact with dynamic and unstructured
environments. While the results are impressive, the application of such systems
to critical tasks like autonomous driving as well as service and care robotics
necessitate the evaluation of large amount of heterogeneous data. Automated
report generation for Mobile Robotics can play a crucial role in facilitating
the evaluation and acceptance of such systems in various domains. In this
paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural
language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local
models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the
privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services.
In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning
multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing
quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation results. Various generated
example reports and other supplementary materials are available via a public
repository.

*Jee Won Lee,Jongseong Brad Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteVoxel is a self-tuning training pipeline for sparse-voxel rasterization that improves stability, reduces VRAM usage by 40-60%, and better preserves low-frequency content while maintaining performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-voxel rasterization tends to underfit low-frequency content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that inflate VRAM usage.

Method: Uses inverse-Sobel reweighting with mid-training gamma-ramp for low-frequency awareness, depth-quantile pruning with EMA-hysteresis guards, and ray-footprint-based priority-driven subdivision under explicit growth budget.

Result: Reduces peak VRAM by 40-60%, mitigates errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while keeping PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to strong SVRaster pipeline.

Conclusion: LiteVoxel enables more predictable, memory-efficient training without sacrificing perceptual quality, preserving low-frequency detail that prior setups miss.

Abstract: Sparse-voxel rasterization is a fast, differentiable alternative for
optimization-based scene reconstruction, but it tends to underfit low-frequency
content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that
inflate VRAM. We introduce LiteVoxel, a self-tuning training pipeline that
makes SV rasterization both steadier and lighter. Our loss is made
low-frequency aware via an inverse-Sobel reweighting with a mid-training
gamma-ramp, shifting gradient budget to flat regions only after geometry
stabilize. Adaptation replaces fixed thresholds with a depth-quantile pruning
logic on maximum blending weight, stabilized by EMA-hysteresis guards and
refines structure through ray-footprint-based, priority-driven subdivision
under an explicit growth budget. Ablations and full-system results across
Mip-NeRF 360 (6scenes) and Tanks & Temples (3scenes) datasets show mitigation
of errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while keeping
PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to a strong SVRaster pipeline.
Crucially, LiteVoxel reduces peak VRAM by ~40%-60% and preserves low-frequency
detail that prior setups miss, enabling more predictable, memory-efficient
training without sacrificing perceptual quality.

*Jessica Plassmann,Nicolas Schuler,Georg von Freymann,Michael Schuth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in shearographic images, evaluating three architectures (fully connected autoencoder, convolutional autoencoder, and student-teacher model) trained on defect-free data only.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shearography is a sensitive non-destructive testing method but has limited industrial adoption due to need for expert interpretation. The research aims to reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation through unsupervised learning.

Method: Three unsupervised architectures evaluated: fully connected autoencoder, convolutional autoencoder, and student-teacher feature matching model. Models trained solely on defect-free data using custom specimen with reproducible defect patterns. Two training subsets used: defect-free only and defect-free plus globally deformed data.

Result: Student-teacher approach achieved superior classification robustness and precise localization. It showed improved feature separability compared to autoencoder models, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. YOLOv8 model served as reference benchmark for localization quality.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic inspection in industrial environments, with student-teacher model showing particular promise.

Abstract: Shearography is a non-destructive testing method for detecting subsurface
defects, offering high sensitivity and full-field inspection capabilities.
However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert
interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this
study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in
shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected
autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature
matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled
dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect
patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under
both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were
defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one
additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter
simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced
fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated
in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial
defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves
superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared
to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of
feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally,
a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to
benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of
unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic
inspection in industrial environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models can predict future brain MRI scans from baseline images with high fidelity, enabling individualized prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict future brain states from baseline MRI scans, which is crucial for studying neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, by forecasting entire brain MRI images rather than just cognitive scores or clinical outcomes.

Method: Implemented and evaluated five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR, Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL) for longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction.

Result: Best performing models achieved high-fidelity predictions of future brain MRIs, with all models generalizing well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort performance.

Conclusion: Deep learning can reliably predict participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities for individualized prognosis in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI)
is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for
studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most
existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such
as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we
investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a
participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically
modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We
implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR,
Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL).
Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans
using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best
performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize
well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort
performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict
participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities
for individualized prognosis.

TL;DR: UVH-26 is the first large-scale Indian traffic dataset with 26,646 images from Bengaluru CCTV cameras, annotated with 1.8M bounding boxes across 14 vehicle classes, showing significant performance improvements for object detection models trained on domain-specific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical gap in existing global benchmarks for Indian traffic scenarios by creating a domain-specific dataset that captures the heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera streams.

Method: Collected 26,646 high-resolution images from 2800 Bengaluru CCTV cameras over 4 weeks, annotated through crowdsourced hackathon with 565 students, derived consensus ground truth using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms, and trained multiple contemporary detectors (YOLO11, RT-DETR, DAMO-YOLO).

Result: Models trained on UVH-26 achieved 8.4-31.5% improvements in mAP50:95 over COCO-trained baselines, with RT-DETR-X showing best performance at 0.67 mAP50:95 compared to 0.40 for COCO-trained weights for common classes.

Conclusion: UVH-26 demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic scenarios and provides a foundation for advancing intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic conditions.

Abstract: This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by
AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from
India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from
2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently
annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from
across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14
vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler
(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,
Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k
consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct
objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,
we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,
and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,
mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in
mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with
RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40
for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This
demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic
scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus
annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the
6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the
heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera
streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and
offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of
intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTF-CVReID is a parameter-efficient framework for video-based person re-identification in cross-view domains that introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone to address viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based person re-identification in cross-view domains (like aerial-ground surveillance) faces challenges from extreme viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies that need to be addressed.

Method: Proposes MTF-CVReID with seven modules: Cross-Stream Feature Normalization, Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization, Identity-Aware Memory Module, Temporal Dynamics Modeling, Inter-View Feature Alignment, Hierarchical Temporal Pattern Learning, and Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning using contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude levels with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS datasets, while maintaining real-time efficiency (189 FPS) with only ~2M additional parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over baseline.

Conclusion: Carefully designed adapter-based modules can substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without compromising computational efficiency in video-based person re-identification.

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for
example, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme
viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address
these challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that
introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,
we include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and
view biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale
stabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to
reinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for
motion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment
(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical
Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;
and (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces
cross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite
adding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,
MTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude
levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS
datasets. These results show that carefully designed adapter-based modules can
substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCFlow is a subject-agnostic brain decoding framework that reconstructs visual experiences from fMRI by modeling the ventral-dorsal visual system architecture, achieving fast reconstruction without per-subject training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable clinical applications of brain decoding by overcoming challenges in cross-subject generalization and complex brain signal processing, without requiring extensive subject-specific training data.

Method: Hierarchical framework modeling ventral-dorsal visual system architecture with feature disentanglement from early visual cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, plus feature-level contrastive learning for subject-invariant representations.

Result: Achieves only 7% accuracy loss compared to conventional methods while generating reconstructed videos in 10 seconds without retraining, compared to >12 hours per subject in traditional approaches.

Conclusion: VCFlow provides a fast and clinically scalable solution for subject-agnostic visual reconstruction from fMRI, offering significant efficiency gains over conventional methods.

Abstract: Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual
experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential
for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to
challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain
signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a
novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal
architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional
representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual
cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary
cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the
extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing
subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike
conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and
heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates
each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast
and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAUE is a training-free diffusion model framework that enables zero-shot, layer-wise image generation through Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), achieving coherent multi-layered outputs without fine-tuning or datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models produce flattened single images, limiting professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions either need large datasets or only generate isolated elements, failing to create complete coherent scenes.

Method: Uses Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC) to extract intermediate latent representations from foreground and composite generation processes, transplanting them into initial noise for subsequent layers to ensure semantic and structural coherence.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods, enhances layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and fidelity, and enables complex compositional editing applications.

Conclusion: TAUE eliminates costly training and dataset requirements, making layer-wise generative workflows more accessible and controllable for professional applications.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their
output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for
professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions
either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are
training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing
to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the
Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a
novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,
Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent
representations from both foreground and composite generation processes,
transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures
semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite
layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring
fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our
training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,
enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and
fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but
also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional
editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative
workflows.

Motivation: Traditional multi-animal tracking requires extensive model fine-tuning and heuristic design for each scenario, which is inefficient and limits applicability.

Method: Combines Grounding Dino object detector with Segment Anything Model 2 tracker using carefully designed heuristics for zero-shot tracking.

Result: Achieves strong and consistent performance across ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and GMOT-40 datasets without any retraining or hyperparameter adaptation.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models enable effective zero-shot multi-animal tracking across diverse species and environments, eliminating the need for dataset-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Multi-animal tracking is crucial for understanding animal ecology and
behavior. However, it remains a challenging task due to variations in habitat,
motion patterns, and species appearance. Traditional approaches typically
require extensive model fine-tuning and heuristic design for each application
scenario. In this work, we explore the potential of recent vision foundation
models for zero-shot multi-animal tracking. By combining a Grounding Dino
object detector with the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) tracker and carefully
designed heuristics, we develop a tracking framework that can be applied to new
datasets without any retraining or hyperparameter adaptation. Evaluations on
ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and a subset of GMOT-40 demonstrate
strong and consistent performance across diverse species and environments. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniChange is the first MLLM-based unified change detection model that integrates both binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD) tasks using special tokens and text prompts, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current change detection models have limited generalization and versatility because they acquire knowledge from single-type annotated data and cannot leverage diverse BCD and SCD datasets simultaneously.

Method: Leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with language priors, introduces three special tokens ([T1], [T2], [CHANGE]), and uses text prompts to guide change category identification instead of predefined classification heads.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on four benchmarks: WHU-CD (90.41 IoU), S2Looking (53.04 IoU), LEVIR-CD+ (78.87 IoU), and SECOND (57.62 IoU), surpassing all previous methods.

Conclusion: UniChange successfully unifies BCD and SCD tasks, effectively acquires knowledge from multi-source datasets even with conflicting class definitions, and demonstrates superior generalization capabilities through MLLM integration.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land
cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets
have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current
models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and
cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic
change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization
and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We
leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop
UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange
integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.
Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction
of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange
utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,
eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows
UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even
when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks
(WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance,
achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively,
surpassing all previous methods. The code is available at

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively detects various presentation attacks and demonstrates practical viability through a demonstration video.

Abstract: Biometric technologies are widely adopted in security, legal, and financial
systems. Face recognition can authenticate a person based on the unique facial
features such as shape and texture. However, recent works have demonstrated the
vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) towards presentation attacks.
Using spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get
illegitimate access to secure systems. This paper proposes a novel light-weight
CNN framework to identify print/display, video and wrap attacks. The proposed
robust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster
biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a
newly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos
collected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture,
we provide a demonstration video depicting print/display, video and wrap attack
detection approaches. The demo can be viewed in the following link:

*Tianfan Peng,Yuntao Du,Pengzhou Ji,Shijie Dong,Kailin Jiang,Mingchuan Ma,Yijun Tian,Jinhe Bi,Qian Li,Wei Du,Feng Xiao,Lizhen Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPruneBench is a unified benchmark for evaluating visual token pruning methods in multimodal LLMs, covering 6 ability dimensions, 10 datasets, 10 compression algorithms, and 3 LMM families with standardized protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large multimodal models suffer from severe inference inefficiency due to excessive visual tokens, and existing token compression methods lack consistent and comprehensive evaluation standards.

Method: Developed UniPruneBench with standardized evaluation protocols across multiple dimensions, incorporating both task accuracy and system-level metrics like runtime and prefilling latency.

Result: Key findings: random pruning is surprisingly strong, no single method consistently outperforms others, OCR tasks are most vulnerable to pruning, and pruning ratio is the dominant performance factor.

Conclusion: UniPruneBench provides a reliable foundation for future research on efficient multimodal modeling through comprehensive and standardized evaluation of visual token pruning methods.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference
inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image
encoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging,
have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented
and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and
extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench
provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets,
covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs
(LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates
system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a
holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning
is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently
outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies
significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning
ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe
UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on
efficient multimodal modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end differentiable tokenizer that adapts to image content with pixel-level granularity while maintaining compatibility with existing Vision Transformer architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers use fixed patch tokens that ignore spatial and semantic structure of images, limiting their ability to adapt to image content.

Method: Hierarchical model selection with information criteria to create adaptive tokens with pixel-level granularity, designed to be backward-compatible with pretrained models.

Result: Competitive performance in both image-level classification and dense-prediction tasks, with additional capability for out-of-the-box raster-to-vector conversion.

Conclusion: The proposed differentiable tokenizer successfully addresses limitations of fixed patch tokens while maintaining compatibility with existing Vision Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Vision Transformers rely on fixed patch tokens that ignore the spatial and
semantic structure of images. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end
differentiable tokenizer that adapts to image content with pixel-level
granularity while remaining backward-compatible with existing architectures for
retrofitting pretrained models. Our method uses hierarchical model selection
with information criteria to provide competitive performance in both
image-level classification and dense-prediction tasks, and even supports
out-of-the-box raster-to-vector conversion.

*Chao Yuan,Zanwu Liu,Guiwei Zhang,Haoxuan Xu,Yujian Zhao,Guanglin Niu,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel VI-ReID framework using Modality-Transition Representation Learning with generated intermediate images as transmitters between visible and infrared modalities, achieving state-of-the-art performance without additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VI-ReID methods have limitations: they create substantial modality gaps, rely on intermediate representations through data enhancement or feature fusion (which adds parameters and lacks interpretability), and don't effectively utilize intermediate features.

Method: Proposes MTRL framework with middle generated image as transmitter from visible to infrared modals, fully aligned with original visible images and similar to infrared modality. Uses modality-transition contrastive loss and modality-query regularization loss for training without additional parameters.

Result: Significantly and consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on three typical VI-ReID datasets while maintaining same inference speed as backbone.

Conclusion: The proposed MTRL framework effectively aligns cross-modal features through modality-transition representation learning, achieving superior VI-ReID performance without computational overhead.

Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) technique could associate
the pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities in the practical
scenarios of background illumination changes. However, a substantial gap
inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods
primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of
the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by
generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing
intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do
not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel
VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a
middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which
are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared
modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a
modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the
cross-modal features more effectively. Notably, our proposed framework does not
need any additional parameters, which achieves the same inference speed to the
backbone while improving its performance on VI-ReID task. Extensive
experimental results illustrate that our model significantly and consistently
outperforms existing SOTAs on three typical VI-ReID datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes VidEmo framework for video emotion analysis using affective cues-guided reasoning and a new emotion dataset Emo-CFG with 2.1M samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotions are dynamic and cues-dependent, making it challenging to understand complex emotional states in videos with reasonable rationale.

Method: Affective cues-guided reasoning framework with video emotion foundation models (VidEmo) using two-stage tuning: curriculum emotion learning followed by affective-tree reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves competitive performance and sets new milestones across 15 face perception tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in video emotion analysis through unified attribute perception and emotion reasoning.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant
attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language
models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion
analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges.
Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it
difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable
rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided
reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression
analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the
core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo),
specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These
models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning
for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement
learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data
infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG)
consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes
explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated
rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding
tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive
performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.

*Vojtěch Kůr,Adam Bajger,Adam Kukučka,Marek Hradil,Vít Musil,Tomáš Brázdil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLEXICORP automates concept relevance propagation (CRP) explanations by integrating multimodal large language models to automatically name concepts and generate natural language explanations from relevance distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CRP workflows require manual inspection of activation images and verbose explanation synthesis, limiting accessibility and scalability of explanations for CNN decisions.

Method: A modular pipeline that couples CRP with a multimodal LLM, using crafted prompts to teach CRP semantics and separate naming/explanation tasks, generating tailored explanations for different audiences.

Result: Qualitative evaluation on ImageNet with VGG16 shows the method can automatically generate descriptive concept names and intuitive natural language explanations from relevance distributions.

Conclusion: Integrating concept-based attribution with LLMs significantly lowers the barrier to interpreting deep neural networks, enabling more transparent AI systems.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision
systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to
explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works
suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be
attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance
propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find
images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are
largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered
concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting
the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.
  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept
Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a
multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive
names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that
translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To
ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the
semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and
explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,
offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries
for non-technical stakeholders.
  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a
VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution
methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to
interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI
systems.

*Tyler Zhu,Tengda Han,Leonidas Guibas,Viorica Pătrăucean,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, examining how modern video and language encoders align across modalities and how this alignment relates to downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While image-text alignment has been well studied, the temporal nature of video data remains largely unexplored in cross-modal representation alignment, creating a gap in understanding video encoder capabilities.

Method: The study proposes parametric test-time scaling laws to capture cross-modal alignment behavior, investigates correlation between semantic alignment and downstream task performance, and examines temporal reasoning in relation to cross-modal alignment.

Result: Findings show cross-modal alignment depends on data richness (visual and text), proposed scaling laws have strong predictive power, strong alignment correlates with general-purpose video representation, and temporal reasoning provides challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: Video-text alignment serves as an informative zero-shot method to probe representation power of encoders for spatio-temporal data, establishing it as a valuable evaluation framework.

Abstract: The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been
shown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream
capabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant
progress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of
video data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing
the capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal
several key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly
depends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)
and text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,
especially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric
test-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable
predictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the
correlation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and
non-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment
against text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and
understanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal
alignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.
Overall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot
way to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal
data. Project page can be found at https://video-prh.github.io/

*Antonio Oroz,Matthias Nießner,Tobias Kirschstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PercHead is a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and semantic 3D editing using perceptual supervision from DINOv2 and SAM2.1, achieving state-of-the-art novel-view synthesis with robustness to extreme angles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in single-image 3D head reconstruction including severe view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and ambiguity of 3D editing.

Method: Uses dual-branch encoder with ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features to 3D via iterative cross-attention, rendered with Gaussian Splatting. For editing, swaps encoder and disentangles geometry (via segmentation maps) and style (via text/image prompts).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis with exceptional robustness to extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines.

Conclusion: PercHead provides a unified approach for high-quality 3D head reconstruction and intuitive semantic editing through an interactive GUI, enabling effortless geometry sculpting and appearance stylization.

Abstract: We present PercHead, a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and
semantic 3D editing - two tasks that are inherently challenging due to severe
view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and the ambiguity of editing in
3D space. We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D
heads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder
followed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through
iterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At
the heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on
DINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric
and appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in
novel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to
extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this
base model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the
encoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry
and style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control
geometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.
We highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model
through a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt
geometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural
language or image prompts.

*Kevin Qinghong Lin,Yuhao Zheng,Hangyu Ran,Dantong Zhu,Dongxing Mao,Linjie Li,Philip Torr,Alex Jinpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCode introduces SVG code as a visual representation benchmark, reframing multimodal understanding as code generation. It covers three domains and proposes CodeVQA for evaluation. VCoder framework improves VLM performance through iterative revision and visual tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current progress focuses on language-centric coding tasks while visual-centric coding remains underexplored. Inspired by human sketch reasoning, the authors advocate SVG code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation.

Method: VCode benchmark reframes multimodal understanding as SVG code generation. VCoder framework augments VLMs with: (i) Thinking with Revision - iterative analysis and refinement of SVG code, and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools - using detectors and parsers for structured cues beyond model capacity.

Result: Frontier VLMs struggle with faithful SVG generation, revealing a gap between language-centric and visual-centric coding. VCoder delivers 12.3-point overall gain over top-performing Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show both humans and VLMs perform worse on rendered SVGs but maintain consistency.

Conclusion: SVG code shows promise as symbolic visual representation. The benchmark reveals persistent gaps in visual-centric coding that current VLMs cannot bridge alone, requiring specialized frameworks like VCoder for improvement.

Abstract: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action
in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks
such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding
underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG
code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We
introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code
generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic
meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general
commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric
perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel
evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered
SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,
frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap
between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we
introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)
Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines
SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply
structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic
capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities
score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D
reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing
Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on
rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual
representation. The benchmark and code are available at

*Yiyang Zhou,Haoqin Tu,Zijun Wang,Zeyu Wang,Niklas Muennighoff,Fan Nie,Yejin Choi,James Zou,Chaorui Deng,Shen Yan,Haoqi Fan,Cihang Xie,Huaxiu Yao,Qinghao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRA is a new benchmark that evaluates models' ability to generate and use intermediate visual images (sketches, diagrams) for reasoning, rather than relying solely on text-based chain-of-thought methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CoT methods only use text, but many complex problems require visual thinking like humans do through "drawing to think". Tasks involving spatial relationships and complex structures are difficult to express through language alone.

Method: Created 546 multimodal problems with annotated intermediate visual images and answers. Uses three evaluation levels: direct input, text-only CoT, and Visual-CoT with annotated image clues and textual prompts. Measures pass@k and majority voting accuracies.

Result: Existing multimodal models perform poorly with text-only prompts but improve significantly (33.7% average gain) when intermediate visual cues are provided. Expanding search space and designing better textual prompts only yield limited improvements compared to Visual-CoT.

Conclusion: Visual information is critical for successful reasoning on complex tasks, demonstrating the importance of imagined visual information in model reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios
where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful
reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in
MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as
sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning
process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through
"drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically
challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning
steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our
evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,
annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a
unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation
input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with
image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image
clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity
on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under
different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large
language models, including strongest private models as well as strong
open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.
However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves
consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and
tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and
designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited
improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the
critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning
on MIRA.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified benchmarking framework to systematically evaluate AI-generated media forensic methods, addressing gaps in standardized benchmarks, inconsistent training protocols, and limited evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated media threats like deepfakes are eroding public trust and increasing fraud, but current forensic methods suffer from non-standardized benchmarks, inconsistent training protocols, and limited evaluation metrics that hinder fair comparison and deployment.

Method: Developed a unified benchmarking framework to evaluate ten state-of-the-art forensic methods (scratch, frozen, and fine-tuned) across seven publicly available datasets (GAN and diffusion) using multiple metrics including accuracy, precision, ROC-AUC, error rate, and sensitivity, plus interpretability analysis with confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps.

Result: Evaluations revealed substantial variability in generalization, with some methods showing strong in-distribution performance but poor cross-model transferability, highlighting the need for more robust and generalizable forensic approaches.

Conclusion: The study provides guidance for deeper understanding of current forensic methods' strengths and limitations, aiming to inspire development of more robust, generalizable, and explainable solutions for AI-generated media detection.

Abstract: The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now
raising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation
detection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the
legal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks.
Although several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three
critical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or
diffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g.,
scratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail
to capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair
comparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in
security-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking
framework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and
reproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,
frozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and
diffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate
performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,
ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model
interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations
demonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods
exhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model
transferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a
deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic
approaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and
explainable solutions.

TL;DR: PLUTO-4 introduces two complementary pathology foundation models - a compact PLUTO-4S for efficient deployment and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G for maximum performance, both achieving state-of-the-art results across various pathology tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build on the progress of foundation models in pathology and extend the Pathology-Universal Transformer (PLUTO) to frontier scale with improved capabilities for diverse histopathology tasks.

Method: Two Vision Transformer architectures: PLUTO-4S (compact, multi-scale deployment with FlexiViT and 2D-RoPE embeddings) and PLUTO-4G (frontier-scale, single patch size for maximum capacity). Both pretrained using self-supervised DINOv2 objective on a large corpus of 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across 50+ institutions.

Result: State-of-the-art performance across patch-level classification, segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. PLUTO-4S provides high-throughput deployment, while PLUTO-4G achieves 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis and establishes new performance frontiers across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: PLUTO-4's diverse improvements demonstrate its potential to transform real-world applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases in pathology.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale pathology image corpora have
demonstrated strong transfer capabilities across diverse histopathology tasks.
Building on this progress, we introduce PLUTO-4, our next generation of
pathology foundation models that extend the Pathology-Universal Transformer
(PLUTO) to frontier scale. We share two complementary Vision Transformer
architectures in the PLUTO-4 family: a compact and efficient PLUTO-4S model
optimized for multi-scale deployment using a FlexiViT setup with 2D-RoPE
embeddings, and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G model trained with a single patch
size to maximize representation capacity and stability. Both models are
pretrained using a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large
multi-institutional corpus containing 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across
over 50 institutions, spanning over 60 disease types and over 100 stains.
Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates
that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying
spatial and biological context, including patch-level classification,
segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides
high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G
establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks,
including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse
improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world
applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases.

TL;DR: DenseMarks is a learned representation for human heads that enables high-quality dense correspondences by predicting 3D embeddings for each pixel in a canonical unit cube space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create robust dense correspondences for human head images that work across diverse poses and individuals, covering the entire head including hair.

Method: Uses Vision Transformer to predict 3D pixel embeddings in canonical space, trained with contrastive loss on pairwise point matches from talking head videos, plus multi-task learning with landmarks, segmentation, and spatial continuity constraints.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models, robust to pose variations.

Conclusion: DenseMarks provides an interpretable canonical space representation that enables various applications like semantic part matching, tracking, and stereo reconstruction with strong cross-pose consistency.

Abstract: We propose DenseMarks - a new learned representation for human heads,
enabling high-quality dense correspondences of human head images. For a 2D
image of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for
each pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In
order to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,
estimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse
in-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,
encouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ
multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well
as imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features,
which results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The
representation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head
tracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method
is robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair.
Additionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained
representations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and
monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model
checkpoint will be made available to the public.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether artificial neural networks can develop mirror-neuron-like patterns and how these might contribute to AI alignment through intrinsic empathy mechanisms rather than external constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI advances toward superhuman capabilities, current alignment strategies relying on external constraints may prove insufficient. The research explores whether intrinsic empathy-like mechanisms modeled after biological mirror neurons could provide more robust alignment.

Method: Used a novel Frog and Toad game framework to promote cooperative behaviors, identified conditions for mirror-neuron pattern emergence, evaluated their influence on action circuits, and introduced the Checkpoint Mirror Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation patterns.

Result: Appropriately scaled model capacities and self/other coupling foster shared neural representations similar to biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative behavior in AI systems.

Conclusion: Intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures, potentially providing more robust alignment against super-intelligent AI.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances toward superhuman capabilities,
aligning these systems with human values becomes increasingly critical. Current
alignment strategies rely largely on externally specified constraints that may
prove insufficient against future super-intelligent AI capable of circumventing
top-down controls.
  This research investigates whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can
develop patterns analogous to biological mirror neurons cells that activate
both when performing and observing actions, and how such patterns might
contribute to intrinsic alignment in AI. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in
empathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks:
(1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these
patterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems?
  Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative
behaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge,
evaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror
Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and
propose a theoretical framework for further study.
  Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and
self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to
biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative
behavior and suggest that intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron
dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding
empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a physical AI system that integrates humans, agentic AI, and wearable hardware for real-world experiments and manufacturing, demonstrated through the APEX system in cleanroom electronics fabrication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between machine intelligence and physical execution in scientific experiments and manufacturing, limiting reproducibility, scalability, and accessibility. Current models remain in virtual domains while real-world processes still rely heavily on human supervision.

Method: The authors developed the Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system that couples agentic reasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. It uses wearable interfaces to capture processes, observe human actions, align them with standard procedures, provide 3D visual guidance, and analyze every step in real-time.

Result: APEX achieved context-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large language models, corrected errors in real time, and successfully transferred expertise to beginners in cleanroom flexible electronics fabrication.

Conclusion: This establishes a new class of agentic-physical-human intelligence that extends agentic reasoning from computation into the physical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.

Abstract: Scientific experiment and manufacture rely on complex, multi-step procedures
that demand continuous human expertise for precise execution and
decision-making. Despite advances in machine learning and automation,
conventional models remain confined to virtual domains, while real-world
experiment and manufacture still rely on human supervision and expertise. This
gap between machine intelligence and physical execution limits reproducibility,
scalability, and accessibility across scientific and manufacture workflows.
Here, we introduce human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a new form of physical AI
that unites human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware into an integrated
system for real-world experiment and intelligent manufacture. In this paradigm,
humans provide precise execution and control, while agentic AI contributes
memory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The
wearable interface continuously captures the experimental and manufacture
processes, facilitates seamless communication between humans and AI for
corrective guidance and interpretable collaboration. As a demonstration, we
present Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system, coupling agentic
reasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. APEX observes and
interprets human actions, aligns them with standard operating procedures,
provides 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a
cleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication, APEX system achieves
context-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large
language models, corrects errors in real time, and transfers expertise to
beginners. These results establish a new class of agentic-physical-human
intelligence that extends agentic reasoning beyond computation into the
physical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into
autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using foundation models to automatically generate reward functions for RL agents in Gran Turismo 7 based on text instructions, achieving competitive performance with champion-level agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing reward functions for RL agents is challenging, especially in complex environments like autonomous racing. Current manual reward design processes are difficult and time-consuming.

Method: Combines LLM-based reward generation, VLM preference-based evaluation, and human feedback to search over reward function spaces for Gran Turismo 7 racing agents.

Result: Produced racing agents competitive with GT Sophy (champion-level RL agent) and generated novel behaviors.

Conclusion: Paves the way for practical automated reward design in real-world applications using foundation models.

Abstract: When designing reinforcement learning (RL) agents, a designer communicates
the desired agent behavior through the definition of reward functions -
numerical feedback given to the agent as reward or punishment for its actions.
However, mapping desired behaviors to reward functions can be a difficult
process, especially in complex environments such as autonomous racing. In this
paper, we demonstrate how current foundation models can effectively search over
a space of reward functions to produce desirable RL agents for the Gran Turismo
7 racing game, given only text-based instructions. Through a combination of
LLM-based reward generation, VLM preference-based evaluation, and human
feedback we demonstrate how our system can be used to produce racing agents
competitive with GT Sophy, a champion-level RL racing agent, as well as
generate novel behaviors, paving the way for practical automated reward design
in real world applications.

*Joshua Ashkinaze,Hua Shen,Sai Avula,Eric Gilbert,Ceren Budak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Deep Value Benchmark (DVB) is a framework that tests whether LLMs learn fundamental human values or just surface-level preferences, revealing that current models generalize deep values less than chance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To distinguish between AI systems that learn deep human values (enabling robust alignment) versus those that only capture superficial patterns (risking misalignment), which is critical for AI safety.

Method: Uses controlled confounding between deep values and shallow features in training data, then breaks these correlations in testing to measure Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR).

Result: Across 9 models, average DVGR is 0.30 (below chance), with larger models performing slightly worse than smaller ones.

Conclusion: Current LLMs fail to generalize deep human values effectively, highlighting a fundamental alignment challenge that DVB can help measure and address.

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), an evaluation framework that
directly tests whether large language models (LLMs) learn fundamental human
values or merely surface-level preferences. This distinction is critical for AI
alignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human
intentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in
preference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel
experimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,
moral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the
training phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately
correlated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently
prefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal
language) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,
presenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,
informal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a
model's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of
generalizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.
Across 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize
deep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than
smaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three
separate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of
a core feature of alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent system that addresses LLMs' limitations in quantitative probability estimation for flood insurance decisions by incorporating retrieval, reasoning, and memory modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flood insurance participation rates remain low despite its effectiveness, highlighting the need to understand behavioral mechanisms behind insurance decisions. LLMs offer promising tools for simulating human decision-making but have limitations in quantitative probability estimation.

Method: Developed InsurAgent with five modules: perception, retrieval (using RAG to ground decisions in empirical survey data), reasoning (using LLM common sense for extrapolation), action, and memory (for temporal decision evolution simulation).

Result: InsurAgent achieves accurate estimation of marginal and bivariate probabilities, captures contextual information intractable for traditional models, and supports simulation of temporal decision evolutions through life trajectories.

Conclusion: InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral modeling and policy analysis by overcoming LLM limitations in quantitative probability estimation while leveraging their qualitative understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Flood insurance is an effective strategy for individuals to mitigate
disaster-related losses. However, participation rates among at-risk populations
in the United States remain strikingly low. This gap underscores the need to
understand and model the behavioral mechanisms underlying insurance decisions.
Large language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited human-like intelligence
across wide-ranging tasks, offering promising tools for simulating human
decision-making. This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance
purchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs
is evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they
fall short in estimating quantitative probabilities. To address this
limitation, InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent comprising five modules
including perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, is proposed.
The retrieval module leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground
decisions in empirical survey data, achieving accurate estimation of marginal
and bivariate probabilities. The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to
extrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is
intractable for traditional models. The memory module supports the simulation
of temporal decision evolutions, illustrated through a roller coaster life
trajectory. Overall, InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral
modeling and policy analysis.

Motivation: To reduce computational costs in reasoning models while maintaining or improving accuracy by dynamically controlling reasoning length and model selection based on predicted rewards.

Method: Trains lightweight adapters on reasoning models to predict expected future rewards as a function of thinking tokens, enabling adaptive control mechanisms.

Result: Achieved 26% compute reduction with maintained accuracy, 4% higher accuracy at equal compute, 55% less compute at equal accuracy, and 11%/7% accuracy improvements in high/low compute regimes.

Conclusion: Re-FORC enables efficient dynamic reasoning with upfront computation estimation and cost-per-token control, significantly improving compute-accuracy tradeoffs.

Abstract: We propose Re-FORC, an adaptive reward prediction method that, given a
context, enables prediction of the expected future rewards as a function of the
number of future thinking tokens. Re-FORC trains a lightweight adapter on
reasoning models, demonstrating improved prediction with longer reasoning and
larger models. Re-FORC enables: 1) early stopping of unpromising reasoning
chains, reducing compute by 26% while maintaining accuracy, 2) optimized model
and thinking length selection that achieves 4% higher accuracy at equal compute
and 55% less compute at equal accuracy compared to the largest model, 3)
adaptive test-time scaling, which increases accuracy by 11% in high compute
regime, and 7% in low compute regime. Re-FORC allows dynamic reasoning with
length control via cost-per-token thresholds while estimating computation time
upfront.

TL;DR: ATHENA is a framework that combines symbolic utility functions with semantic adaptation using LLMs to model personalized human decision-making, outperforming existing models by at least 6.5% in F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between population-level optimal predictions and individual decision-making processes, which are influenced by both numerical factors and linguistic preferences.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) LLM-augmented symbolic discovery for group-level utility functions, 2) Individual-level semantic adaptation creating personalized templates guided by optimal utility.

Result: Consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based models on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, with at least 6.5% F1 score improvement.

Conclusion: ATHENA provides an effective scheme for human-centric decision modeling by integrating symbolic utility modeling and semantic adaptation, with both stages being critical and complementary.

Abstract: Decision-making models for individuals, particularly in high-stakes scenarios
like vaccine uptake, often diverge from population optimal predictions. This
gap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process,
shaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences
(e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory
and leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric
Reasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.
ATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level
symbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it
implements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic
templates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.
Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA
consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based
models, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge
models. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are
critical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall
predictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling
and semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling
human-centric decisions. The project page can be found at

Conclusion: STRMAC enables efficient and effective collaboration in multi-agent systems through adaptive routing and self-evolving data generation.

Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs)
has unlocked new frontiers in complex task-solving, enabling diverse agents to
integrate unique expertise, collaborate flexibly, and address challenges
unattainable for individual models. However, the full potential of such systems

single agent at each step for efficient and effective collaboration.
Furthermore, we introduce a self-evolving data generation approach that
accelerates the collection of high-quality execution paths for efficient system
training. Experiments on challenging collaborative reasoning benchmarks

Abstract: Complex reasoning over tabular data is crucial in real-world data analysis,

Motivation: Previous research ideation methods rely on simplistic approaches like keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity, overlooking complex contextual relationships between scientific concepts and failing to effectively utilize scientific concept networks.

Method: Proposes Deep Ideation framework with explore-expand-evolve workflow, scientific network capturing keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, Idea Stack for progress tracking, and critic engine trained on real-world reviewer feedback.

Result: 10.67% improvement in idea quality compared to other methods, with generated ideas surpassing top conference acceptance levels. Human evaluation confirms practical value in scientific research.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates scientific networks with LLM-driven ideation, demonstrating significant improvements in research idea generation quality and practical applicability.

Abstract: Novel research ideas play a critical role in advancing scientific inquiries.
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
potential to generate novel research ideas by leveraging large-scale scientific
literature. However, previous work in research ideation has primarily relied on
simplistic methods, such as keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity. These
approaches focus on identifying statistical associations in the literature but
overlook the complex, contextual relationships between scientific concepts,
which are essential to effectively leverage knowledge embedded in human
literature. For instance, papers that simultaneously mention "keyword A" and
"keyword B" often present research ideas that integrate both concepts.
Additionally, some LLM-driven methods propose and refine research ideas using
the model's internal knowledge, but they fail to effectively utilize the
scientific concept network, limiting the grounding of ideas in established
research. To address these challenges, we propose the Deep Ideation framework
to address these challenges, integrating a scientific network that captures
keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, enriching LLM-driven
ideation. The framework introduces an explore-expand-evolve workflow to
iteratively refine research ideas, using an Idea Stack to track progress. A
critic engine, trained on real-world reviewer feedback, guides the process by
providing continuous feedback on the novelty and feasibility of ideas. Our
experiments show that our approach improves the quality of generated ideas by
10.67% compared to other methods, with ideas surpassing top conference
acceptance levels. Human evaluation highlights their practical value in
scientific research, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each
component in the workflow. Code repo is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to analyze how multimodal LLMs resolve conflicts between modalities by decomposing modality following into relative reasoning uncertainty and inherent modality preference, revealing a universal law about uncertainty's role.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work only measured modality following with coarse dataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in unimodal reasoning and failing to disentangle modality bias from unimodal capabilities.

Method: Constructed a controllable dataset that systematically varies visual and textual reasoning difficulty, used entropy as uncertainty metric, and probed layer-wise predictions to reveal internal mechanisms.

Result: Discovered a universal law: probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative uncertainty increases. Identified balance points that indicate inherent modality preference and revealed oscillation mechanisms in ambiguous regions.

Conclusion: Relative uncertainty and inherent preference are the two governing principles of modality following, providing both quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into how MLLMs resolve conflicting information across modalities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) must resolve conflicts when
different modalities provide contradictory information, a process we term
modality following. Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse
dataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in
unimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes
modality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty
(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent
modality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To
validate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that
systematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.
Using entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:
the probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative
uncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends
to follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance
point, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike
traditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less
confounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal
capabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,
we reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the
balance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining
externally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative
uncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality
following, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into
how MLLMs resolve conflicting information.

It provides theoretical analysis, introduces causal influence measurement, and proposes a verifiable reward mechanism to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent reasoning systems suffer from lazy agent behavior where collaboration collapses to ineffective single-agent performance, limiting the potential of multi-agent frameworks for complex reasoning tasks.

Method: The paper provides theoretical analysis of lazy behavior, introduces stable causal influence measurement, and proposes a verifiable reward mechanism that allows reasoning agents to discard noisy outputs, consolidate instructions, and restart reasoning when necessary.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework successfully alleviates lazy agent behavior and unlocks the full potential of multi-agent frameworks for complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses lazy agent behavior in multi-agent reasoning systems through theoretical insights, causal influence measurement, and verifiable reward mechanisms, enabling more effective collaboration in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning and
verifiable rewards have achieved strong results on complex reasoning tasks.
Recent work extends this paradigm to a multi-agent setting, where a
meta-thinking agent proposes plans and monitors progress while a reasoning
agent executes subtasks through sequential conversational turns. Despite
promising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior,
in which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining
collaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this
paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior
naturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and
efficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue.
Finally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost
in multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter
this, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by
allowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate
instructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and
unlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality in women, and early diagnosis is critical but challenging due to disease complexity and variable risk factors.

Method: Developed a fuzzy soft set theory-based expert system that integrates BMI, insulin level, leptin level, adiponectin level, and age through fuzzy inference rules and soft set computations.

Result: The system provides a non-invasive preliminary assessment method using parameters obtainable from routine blood analyses, validated with data from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Conclusion: The expert system aims to help healthcare professionals identify high-risk patients and determine the need for further diagnostic procedures like biopsies.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality among women
worldwide, with early diagnosis being critical for effective treatment and
improved survival rates. However, timely detection continues to be a challenge
due to the complex nature of the disease and variability in patient risk
factors. This study presents a fuzzy soft set theory-based expert system
designed to assess the risk of breast cancer in patients using measurable
clinical and physiological parameters. The proposed system integrates Body Mass
Index, Insulin Level, Leptin Level, Adiponectin Level, and age as input
variables to estimate breast cancer risk through a set of fuzzy inference rules
and soft set computations. These parameters can be obtained from routine blood
analyses, enabling a non-invasive and accessible method for preliminary
assessment. The dataset used for model development and validation was obtained
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The proposed expert system aims to
support healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients and
determining the necessity of further diagnostic procedures such as biopsies.

### [81] [A New Perspective on Precision and Recall for Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02414)
*Benjamin Sykes,Loïc Simon,Julien Rabin,Jalal Fadili*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new framework for estimating entire Precision-Recall curves for generative models based on binary classification, with statistical analysis and minimax risk bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for generative models rely on scalar metrics, but Precision-Recall curves offer richer analysis. However, estimating entire PR curves poses challenges that need to be addressed.

Method: Proposed a binary classification-based framework for estimating entire PR curves, conducted statistical analysis of estimates, derived minimax upper bounds on PR estimation risk, and extended existing PR metrics.

Result: The framework successfully estimates complete PR curves, provides statistical guarantees through minimax bounds, and generalizes existing PR metrics that were previously limited to extreme curve values.

Conclusion: The proposed binary classification framework enables comprehensive PR curve estimation for generative models with statistical rigor, overcoming limitations of existing methods and providing richer evaluation capabilities.

Abstract: With the recent success of generative models in image and text, the question
of their evaluation has recently gained a lot of attention. While most methods
from the state of the art rely on scalar metrics, the introduction of Precision
and Recall (PR) for generative model has opened up a new avenue of research.
The associated PR curve allows for a richer analysis, but their estimation
poses several challenges. In this paper, we present a new framework for
estimating entire PR curves based on a binary classification standpoint. We
conduct a thorough statistical analysis of the proposed estimates. As a
byproduct, we obtain a minimax upper bound on the PR estimation risk. We also
show that our framework extends several landmark PR metrics of the literature
which by design are restrained to the extreme values of the curve. Finally, we
study the different behaviors of the curves obtained experimentally in various
settings.

*Jae-Woo Choi,Hyungmin Kim,Hyobin Ong,Minsu Jang,Dohyung Kim,Jaehong Kim,Youngwoo Yoon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReAcTree is a hierarchical task-planning method that decomposes complex goals into manageable subgoals using a dynamically constructed agent tree, outperforming existing methods on embodied AI benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks because they rely on monolithic trajectories that entangle all past decisions and observations, attempting to solve entire tasks in a single unified process.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical approach with dynamically constructed agent trees where each subgoal is handled by LLM agent nodes capable of reasoning and acting, while control flow nodes coordinate execution strategies. Integrates two memory systems: episodic memory for goal-specific examples and working memory for shared environmental observations.

Result: Experiments on WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets show ReAcTree consistently outperforms strong baselines like ReAct across diverse LLMs. On WAH-NL, achieves 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5 72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.

Conclusion: ReAcTree effectively addresses limitations of monolithic planning approaches by decomposing complex tasks hierarchically, demonstrating significant performance improvements in embodied autonomous agent task planning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled significant
progress in decision-making and task planning for embodied autonomous agents.
However, most existing methods still struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks
because they rely on a monolithic trajectory that entangles all past decisions
and observations, attempting to solve the entire task in a single unified
process. To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical
task-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable
subgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled
by an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the
tree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent
nodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent
node retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and
shares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on
the WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets demonstrate that ReAcTree consistently
outperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs.
Notably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5
72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VMR enables RLVR training for open-ended tasks by reformulating them into verifiable multiple-choice formats, achieving 5.99 average improvement across 8 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR works well for reasoning tasks with standard answers but fails for open-ended tasks lacking ground truth, creating a gap in applying reasoning capabilities to creative domains.

Method: Proposes Verifiable Multiple-Choice Reformulation (VMR) that transforms open-ended data into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling RLVR training without explicit ground truth.

Result: Achieves average gain of 5.99 points over baseline across eight open-ended benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance improvement.

Conclusion: VMR successfully extends RLVR to open-ended tasks, proving that reasoning capabilities can be effectively leveraged even in domains without standard answers.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated great
potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), achieving remarkable progress in domains such as mathematics and
programming where standard answers are available. However, for open-ended tasks
lacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction
following), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios,
thereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a
key question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended
tasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the
open domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose
the existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended
tasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice
Reformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended
data into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even
in the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM
performance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across eight open-ended benchmarks,
our VMR-based training delivers an average gain of 5.99 points over the
baseline. Code will be released upon acceptance to facilitate reproducibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Agentic AI as a solution for automating 5G/6G network optimization, outlining its core concepts and presenting a practical RAN optimization use case using LAM-driven agents for autonomous decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G networks makes manual optimization ineffective, requiring automated solutions. Agentic AI offers human-level cognitive abilities for dynamic RAN environments, but lacks established frameworks and definitions.

Method: The paper outlines Agentic AI core concepts, traces its evolution from classical agents, describes design patterns (reflection, planning, tool use, multi-agent collaboration), and presents a practical 5G RAN case study using time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents for KPI-based autonomous decision-making.

Result: The paper provides a conceptual framework for Agentic AI in mobile networks and demonstrates its practical application through a RAN optimization case study, showing how intelligent behaviors can be orchestrated for autonomous network management.

Conclusion: Agentic AI represents a promising paradigm for automating complex 5G/6G networks, with the proposed framework and practical case study contributing to establishing foundational components and operational principles for future Agentic AI systems in telecommunications.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a new paradigm for automating complex systems by using
Large AI Models (LAMs) to provide human-level cognitive abilities with
multimodal perception, planning, memory, and reasoning capabilities. This will
lead to a new generation of AI systems that autonomously decompose goals,
retain context over time, learn continuously, operate across tools and
environments, and adapt dynamically. The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G
networks renders manual optimization ineffective, pointing to Agentic AI as a
method for automating decisions in dynamic RAN environments. However, despite
its rapid advances, there is no established framework outlining the
foundational components and operational principles of Agentic AI systems nor a
universally accepted definition.
  This paper contributes to ongoing research on Agentic AI in 5G and 6G
networks by outlining its core concepts and then proposing a practical use case
that applies Agentic principles to RAN optimization. We first introduce Agentic
AI, tracing its evolution from classical agents and discussing the progress
from workflows and simple AI agents to Agentic AI. Core design
patterns-reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration-are then
described to illustrate how intelligent behaviors are orchestrated. These
theorical concepts are grounded in the context of mobile networks, with a focus
on RAN management and optimization. A practical 5G RAN case study shows how
time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents collaborate for KPI-based
autonomous decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KLPEG framework uses Knowledge Graphs and LLMs to enable efficient, update-specific automated game testing by accumulating knowledge across versions and generating targeted test cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in automated game testing caused by frequent updates, where current LLM-based methods lack structured knowledge accumulation for precise testing of incremental updates.

Method: Constructs Knowledge Graph to model game elements, dependencies, and causal relationships; uses LLMs to parse update logs and perform multi-hop reasoning on KG to identify impact scope and generate tailored test cases.

Result: Experiments in Overcooked and Minecraft show KLPEG accurately locates affected functionalities and completes tests in fewer steps, improving both effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: KLPEG framework successfully enables knowledge accumulation and reuse across game versions, providing precise and efficient automated testing for incremental updates.

Abstract: The rapid iteration and frequent updates of modern video games pose
significant challenges to the efficiency and specificity of testing. Although
automated playtesting methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise, they often lack structured knowledge accumulation mechanisms, making
it difficult to conduct precise and efficient testing tailored for incremental
game updates. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a KLPEG framework.
The framework constructs and maintains a Knowledge Graph (KG) to systematically
model game elements, task dependencies, and causal relationships, enabling
knowledge accumulation and reuse across versions. Building on this foundation,
the framework utilizes LLMs to parse natural language update logs, identify the
scope of impact through multi-hop reasoning on the KG, enabling the generation
of update-tailored test cases. Experiments in two representative game
environments, Overcooked and Minecraft, demonstrate that KLPEG can more
accurately locate functionalities affected by updates and complete tests in
fewer steps, significantly improving both playtesting effectiveness and
efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORCA Benchmark evaluates LLMs on multi-domain quantitative reasoning using 500 real-life tasks, showing state-of-the-art models achieve only 45-63% accuracy with rounding and calculation errors being the main issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' quantitative reasoning capabilities across real-life domains (finance, physics, health, statistics) using verified calculator outputs, addressing limitations of standard math datasets.

Method: Used 500 natural-language tasks across multiple domains with verified outputs from Omni's calculator engine, evaluating step-by-step reasoning, numerical precision, and domain generalization.

Result: Five state-of-the-art LLMs achieved only 45-63% accuracy, with 35% rounding errors and 33% calculation mistakes. Models showed strengths in math/engineering but weaknesses in physics/natural sciences.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in quantitative reasoning, with partial complementarity rather than redundancy in error patterns, highlighting the need for improved numerical precision and domain generalization.

Abstract: We present ORCA (Omni Research on Calculation in AI) Benchmark -- a novel
benchmark that evaluates large language models (LLMs) on multi-domain,
real-life quantitative reasoning using verified outputs from Omni's calculator
engine. In 500 natural-language tasks across domains such as finance, physics,
health, and statistics, the five state-of-the-art systems (ChatGPT-5,
Gemini~2.5~Flash, Claude~Sonnet~4.5, Grok~4, and DeepSeek~V3.2) achieved only
$45\text{--}63\,\%$ accuracy, with errors mainly related to rounding ($35\,\%$)
and calculation mistakes ($33\,\%$). Results in specific domains indicate
strengths in mathematics and engineering, but weaknesses in physics and natural
sciences. Correlation analysis ($r \approx 0.40\text{--}0.65$) shows that the
models often fail together but differ in the types of errors they make,
highlighting their partial complementarity rather than redundancy. Unlike
standard math datasets, ORCA evaluates step-by-step reasoning, numerical
precision, and domain generalization across real problems from finance,
physics, health, and statistics.

*Tiberiu-Andrei Georgescu,Alexander W. Goodall,Dalal Alrajeh,Francesco Belardinelli,Sebastian Uchitel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first adaptive shielding framework for reinforcement learning that automatically repairs GR(1) specifications online when environment assumptions are violated, maintaining both safety and liveness properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical shielding approaches in RL are static and fail to adapt when environment assumptions are violated, leading to suboptimal performance and potential safety issues.

Method: The framework detects environment assumption violations at runtime and uses Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to automatically repair GR(1) specifications online in a systematic and interpretable way.

Result: In case studies (Minepump and Atari Seaquest), RL agents with adaptive shields maintained near-optimal reward and perfect logical compliance compared to static shields, which were often severely suboptimal.

Conclusion: Adaptive shielding provides a graceful evolution of safety guarantees, ensuring liveness is achievable and weakening goals only when necessary, outperforming static shielding approaches.

Abstract: Shielding is widely used to enforce safety in reinforcement learning (RL),
ensuring that an agent's actions remain compliant with formal specifications.
Classical shielding approaches, however, are often static, in the sense that
they assume fixed logical specifications and hand-crafted abstractions. While
these static shields provide safety under nominal assumptions, they fail to
adapt when environment assumptions are violated. In this paper, we develop the
first adaptive shielding framework - to the best of our knowledge - based on
Generalized Reactivity of rank 1 (GR(1)) specifications, a tractable and
expressive fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that captures both safety
and liveness properties. Our method detects environment assumption violations
at runtime and employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to automatically
repair GR(1) specifications online, in a systematic and interpretable way. This
ensures that the shield evolves gracefully, ensuring liveness is achievable and
weakening goals only when necessary. We consider two case studies: Minepump and
Atari Seaquest; showing that (i) static symbolic controllers are often severely
suboptimal when optimizing for auxiliary rewards, and (ii) RL agents equipped
with our adaptive shield maintain near-optimal reward and perfect logical
compliance compared with static shields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-centered fields require authentic practice, but realistic simulations of human behavior have been limited. Current neural models lack transparency and psychological grounding.

Method: Uses a multi-agent system grounded in psychological theories (self-efficacy, mindset, social constructivism) that simulates an "inner parliament" of agents representing key psychological factors. These agents deliberate and interact to determine output behavior.

Result: The system enables unprecedented transparency and alignment with human psychology, generating believable human behaviors for applications in teacher training and research.

Conclusion: The system embodies principles of social learning, cognitive apprenticeship, deliberate practice, and meta-cognition, providing a psychologically-grounded alternative to black-box neural models for human behavior simulation.

Abstract: Training and education in human-centered fields require authentic practice,
yet realistic simulations of human behavior have remained limited. We present a
multi-agent psychological simulation system that models internal
cognitive-affective processes to generate believable human behaviors. In
contrast to black-box neural models, this system is grounded in established
psychological theories (e.g., self-efficacy, mindset, social constructivism)
and explicitly simulates an ``inner parliament'' of agents corresponding to key
psychological factors. These agents deliberate and interact to determine the
system's output behavior, enabling unprecedented transparency and alignment
with human psychology. We describe the system's architecture and theoretical
foundations, illustrate its use in teacher training and research, and discuss
how it embodies principles of social learning, cognitive apprenticeship,
deliberate practice, and meta-cognition.

TL;DR: DecompSR is a large benchmark dataset and generation framework for analyzing compositional spatial reasoning in LLMs, featuring over 5 million datapoints with independently controllable aspects of compositionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a rigorous benchmark for analyzing compositional spatial reasoning abilities in Large Language Models, addressing the need for provably correct datasets that can independently vary key aspects of compositionality.

Method: Built procedurally to be correct by construction, with independent verification using symbolic solvers. The framework allows independent variation of productivity (reasoning depth), substitutivity (entity/linguistic variability), overgeneralisation (input order, distractors), and systematicity (novel linguistic elements).

Result: LLMs struggle with productive and systematic generalization in spatial reasoning tasks but are more robust to linguistic variation. The benchmark provides fine-grained analysis of compositional reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: DecompSR offers a provably correct, comprehensive benchmarking dataset that enables robust and fine-grained probing of LLMs' compositional reasoning capabilities through independent control of multiple compositionality aspects.

Abstract: We introduce DecompSR, decomposed spatial reasoning, a large benchmark
dataset (over 5m datapoints) and generation framework designed to analyse
compositional spatial reasoning ability. The generation of DecompSR allows
users to independently vary several aspects of compositionality, namely:
productivity (reasoning depth), substitutivity (entity and linguistic
variability), overgeneralisation (input order, distractors) and systematicity
(novel linguistic elements). DecompSR is built procedurally in a manner which
makes it is correct by construction, which is independently verified using a
symbolic solver to guarantee the correctness of the dataset. DecompSR is
comprehensively benchmarked across a host of Large Language Models (LLMs) where
we show that LLMs struggle with productive and systematic generalisation in
spatial reasoning tasks whereas they are more robust to linguistic variation.
DecompSR provides a provably correct and rigorous benchmarking dataset with a
novel ability to independently vary the degrees of several key aspects of
compositionality, allowing for robust and fine-grained probing of the
compositional reasoning abilities of LLMs.

*Tim R. Davidson,Adam Fourney,Saleema Amershi,Robert West,Eric Horvitz,Ece Kamar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A study reveals a 'collaboration gap' where AI models that perform well individually often degrade significantly when required to collaborate, with small distilled models failing almost completely in certain pairings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI development increasingly relies on agent-based systems with heterogeneous agents having different information and tools, effective collaboration becomes critical, but few empirical studies have evaluated agent-agent collaboration at scale.

Method: Developed a collaborative maze-solving benchmark that isolates collaborative capabilities, modulates complexity, enables automated grading, and preserves ecological plausibility. Evaluated 32 leading models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings.

Result: Found that collaboration can break down dramatically - small distilled models that solve mazes well alone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. Starting with the stronger agent improves outcomes, motivating a 'relay inference' approach that closes much of the collaboration gap.

Conclusion: Argues for collaboration-aware evaluation, training strategies to enhance collaborative capabilities, and interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent skills, applicable to both AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: The trajectory of AI development suggests that we will increasingly rely on
agent-based systems composed of independently developed agents with different
information, privileges, and tools. The success of these systems will
critically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents,
even under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical
studies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a
collaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative
capabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable
automated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving
ecological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and
closed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our
results reveal a "collaboration gap": models that perform well solo often
degrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break
down dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well
alone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting
with the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a "relay inference"
approach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,
closing much of the gap. Our findings argue for (1) collaboration-aware
evaluation, (2) training strategies developed to enhance collaborative
capabilities, and (3) interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent
skills, guidance that applies to AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

*Jiayu Liu,Cheng Qian,Zhaochen Su,Qing Zong,Shijue Huang,Bingxiang He,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CostBench is a new benchmark that evaluates LLM agents' cost-aware planning and replanning abilities in travel planning scenarios, revealing significant gaps in economic reasoning and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent evaluations focus mainly on task completion while neglecting resource efficiency and adaptability to changing environments, missing crucial economic reasoning capabilities.

Method: CostBench uses travel-planning tasks with multiple solution paths involving atomic/composite tools with customizable costs, and introduces four types of dynamic blocking events (tool failures, cost changes) to test real-time adaptation.

Result: Evaluation shows major gaps in cost-aware planning: agents fail to find optimal solutions in static settings (GPT-5 <75% exact match on hardest tasks), with performance dropping ~40% under dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: CostBench provides a foundation for developing economically rational and robust agents by identifying current weaknesses in cost optimization and dynamic replanning capabilities.

Abstract: Current evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily emphasize
task completion, often overlooking resource efficiency and adaptability. This
neglects a crucial capability: agents' ability to devise and adjust
cost-optimal plans in response to changing environments. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate
agents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the
travel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple
sequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It
also supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and
cost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to
adapt in real time. Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on
CostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently
fail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5
achieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance
further dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions. By diagnosing these
weaknesses, CostBench lays the groundwork for developing future agents that are
both economically rational and robust.

### [92] [Using Span Queries to Optimize for Cache and Attention Locality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02749)
*Paul Castro,Nick Mitchell,Nathan Ordonez,Thomas Parnell,Mudhakar Srivatsa,Antoni Viros i Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces span queries as a generalized interface for inference servers to handle diverse non-chat workloads like RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic tasks, achieving 10-20x TTFT reductions and better attention locality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference servers are optimized for chat completion but clients are evolving to use various inference-time scaling and deep reasoning techniques. Prior solutions only address single use cases like RAG, creating a need for a more generalized approach.

Method: The paper introduces span queries - expression trees of inference calls with commutativity constraints. It modifies vLLM (492 lines) to enable high-performance execution and automatic optimization of span queries for KV cache locality and attention locality.

Result: Span queries achieve 10-20x reductions in Time To First Token (TTFT) for non-chat use cases. Attention-optimized span queries on a 2b parameter model outperform stock inference servers using 8b models in accuracy.

Conclusion: Span queries provide a unified interface that generalizes across multiple inference workloads, enabling significant performance improvements and better resource utilization while addressing the lost-in-the-middle problem in attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Clients are evolving beyond chat completion, and now include a variety of
innovative inference-time scaling and deep reasoning techniques. At the same
time, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior
work has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if
inference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer
solutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we
introduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server.
We demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads
can all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that
had been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter
-- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper
introduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked
together with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and
semantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache
locality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can
enable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we
demonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two
distinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be
optimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called
lost-in-the-middle problem. We demonstrate that an attention-optimized span
query on a 2b parameter model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock
inference server using an 8b model.

Motivation: The rapid growth of research output in control engineering requires new approaches to structure and formalize domain knowledge for better accessibility and verifiability.

Method: Based on the Imperative Representation of Knowledge (PyIRK) framework, using language models to transform natural-language descriptions and mathematical definitions (LaTeX source code) into formalized knowledge graphs.

Result: Development of an "interactive semantic layer" to enhance source documents and facilitate knowledge transfer in control engineering.

Conclusion: This approach contributes to creating easily accessible, collaborative, and verifiable knowledge bases for the control engineering domain.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research output in control engineering calls for new
approaches to structure and formalize domain knowledge. This paper briefly
describes an LLM-supported method for semi-automated generation of formal
knowledge representations that combine human readability with machine
interpretability and increased expressiveness. Based on the Imperative
Representation of Knowledge (PyIRK) framework, we demonstrate how language
models can assist in transforming natural-language descriptions and
mathematical definitions (available as LaTeX source code) into a formalized
knowledge graph. As a first application we present the generation of an
``interactive semantic layer'' to enhance the source documents in order to
facilitate knowledge transfer. From our perspective this contributes to the
vision of easily accessible, collaborative, and verifiable knowledge bases for
the control engineering domain.

*Chenyu Zhang,Minsol Kim,Shohreh Ghorbani,Jingyao Wu,Rosalind Picard,Patricia Maes,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A diagnostic framework for analyzing multimodal reasoning failures where one modality's high-confidence error overrides other evidence, using modality-as-agent approach to identify contributors and saboteurs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models' reasoning traces are opaque - unclear which modality drives predictions, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates, making it hard to understand failure modes.

Method: Proposes a lightweight, model-agnostic evaluation layer treating each modality as an agent that produces candidate labels and self-assessments, with a simple fusion mechanism to aggregate outputs and identify contributors vs saboteurs.

Result: Case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks revealed systematic reliability profiles, showing whether failures arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal reasoning, enabling principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing potential interventions.

Abstract: Despite rapid growth in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their
reasoning traces remain opaque: it is often unclear which modality drives a
prediction, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates. In this
paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a
high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused
result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic
evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate
labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism
aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct
outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic
layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with
foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight
into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations.
More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal
reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing
possible interventions.

*Mohamed Bouadi,Pratinav Seth,Aditya Tanna,Vinay Kumar Sankarapu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Orion-MSP is a new tabular in-context learning architecture that addresses limitations of current models through multi-scale processing, block-sparse attention, and Perceiver-style memory for efficient and scalable tabular data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tabular ICL models have limitations including single-scale feature processing, quadratic scaling attention mechanisms, and sequential component processing that prevents iterative refinement and cross-component communication.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) multi-scale processing for hierarchical feature interactions, (2) block-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for scalable efficiency, and (3) Perceiver-style memory enabling bidirectional information flow across components.

Result: Across diverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables.

Conclusion: Orion-MSP establishes a new standard for efficient tabular in-context learning, addressing key limitations of existing architectures.

Abstract: Tabular data remain the predominant format for real-world applications. Yet,
developing effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to
heterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple
scales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN
and TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to
gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However,
current architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature
processing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with
quadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component
processing that prevents iterative representation refinement and
cross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce
Orion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1)
multi-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2)
block-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for
scalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style
memory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across
diverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance
while scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new
standard for efficient tabular in-context learning. The model is publicly

*Chloe Loughridge,Paul Colognese,Avery Griffin,Tyler Tracy,Jon Kutasov,Joe Benton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to optimize attack policies for AI control evaluations by decomposing attack capability into five skills and using a probabilistic model to overcome data limitations, achieving significant improvement in attack strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI deployments become more complex and high-stakes, estimating their risk through AI control frameworks becomes crucial, but this requires eliciting strong attack policies which is challenging in data-poor environments due to compute constraints.

Method: Decompose attack capability into five constituent skills (suspicion modeling, attack selection, plan synthesis, execution, and subtlety), develop a probabilistic model of attack dynamics to optimize hyperparameters in simulation, and transfer results to SHADE-Arena environments.

Result: Substantial improvement in attack strength, reducing safety score from a baseline of 0.87 to 0.41 using the proposed scaffold.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the challenge of optimizing attack policies in data-poor environments by skill decomposition and simulation-based optimization, leading to significantly stronger attacks for AI control evaluations.

Abstract: As AI deployments become more complex and high-stakes, it becomes
increasingly important to be able to estimate their risk. AI control is one
framework for doing so. However, good control evaluations require eliciting
strong attack policies. This can be challenging in complex agentic environments
where compute constraints leave us data-poor. In this work, we show how to
optimize attack policies in SHADE-Arena, a dataset of diverse realistic control
environments. We do this by decomposing attack capability into five constituent
skills -- suspicion modeling, attack selection, plan synthesis, execution and
subtlety -- and optimizing each component individually. To get around the
constraint of limited data, we develop a probabilistic model of attack
dynamics, optimize our attack hyperparameters using this simulation, and then
show that the results transfer to SHADE-Arena. This results in a substantial
improvement in attack strength, reducing safety score from a baseline of 0.87
to 0.41 using our scaffold.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents for scientific research are limited in the number of actions they can take before losing coherence, which restricts the depth of their findings.

Method: Kosmos uses a structured world model to share information between data analysis and literature search agents, enabling coherent pursuit of objectives over extended periods (up to 12 hours) with parallel execution of analysis cycles.

Result: Kosmos executes 42,000 lines of code and reads 1,500 papers per run, with 79.4% of statements in its reports found accurate by independent scientists. A single 20-cycle run performs the equivalent of 6 months of human research time.

Conclusion: Kosmos successfully automates scientific discovery across multiple domains, reproducing three independent findings and making four novel contributions to scientific literature, with valuable findings scaling linearly with cycles.

Abstract: Data-driven scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of literature
search, hypothesis generation, and data analysis. Substantial progress has been
made towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such
agents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing
coherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos,
an AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended
objective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of
parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before
synthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos
uses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis
agent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to
coherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively
executing an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run.
Kosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature,
ensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of
statements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a
single 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own
research time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number
of valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles
(tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that
span metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics.
Three discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or
unpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four
make novel contributions to the scientific literature.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using logic as a semantic framework for deep learning and neurosymbolic AI to address the lack of semantics in AI-based scientific discoveries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI lacks semantics, making its scientific discoveries unsatisfactory. There's a need for formalization to translate AI insights into comprehensible scientific knowledge.

Method: Uses logic in a neurosymbolic framework to provide semantics for deep learning. Introduces a framework for semantic encoding that explicitly maps neural networks to logic and characterizes existing approaches.

Result: Developed a formal framework linking logical semantics and neural networks, reviewed prominent neural encoding and knowledge extraction techniques, and provided formal definitions.

Conclusion: Logic offers an adequate framework for providing semantics to AI-based science, though identifying semantic encodings in practice faces difficulties similar to philosophy of mind problems.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful new language of science as
evidenced by recent Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics that recognized
contributions to AI applied to those areas. Yet, this new language lacks
semantics, which makes AI's scientific discoveries unsatisfactory at best. With
the purpose of uncovering new facts but also improving our understanding of the
world, AI-based science requires formalization through a framework capable of
translating insight into comprehensible scientific knowledge. In this paper, we
argue that logic offers an adequate framework. In particular, we use logic in a
neurosymbolic framework to offer a much needed semantics for deep learning, the
neural network-based technology of current AI. Deep learning and neurosymbolic
AI lack a general set of conditions to ensure that desirable properties are
satisfied. Instead, there is a plethora of encoding and knowledge extraction
approaches designed for particular cases. To rectify this, we introduced a
framework for semantic encoding, making explicit the mapping between neural
networks and logic, and characterizing the common ingredients of the various
existing approaches. In this paper, we describe succinctly and exemplify how
logical semantics and neural networks are linked through this framework, we
review some of the most prominent approaches and techniques developed for
neural encoding and knowledge extraction, provide a formal definition of our
framework, and discuss some of the difficulties of identifying a semantic
encoding in practice in light of analogous problems in the philosophy of mind.

Motivation: Current MLLMs are limited to fixed modality pairs, require costly fine-tuning, and lack robust reasoning support for fully omni-capable models integrating text, images, audio, and video.

Method: A master-agent system where the master interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their outputs into coherent responses without retraining existing models.

Result: Extensive experiments show Agent-Omni consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks, particularly on complex cross-modal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The agent-based design enables seamless integration of specialized foundation models, maintains adaptability and interpretability, and provides a modular, extensible framework for future improvements as stronger models become available.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but

*Zijian Zhang,Rong Wang,Shiyang Li,Yuebo Luo,Mingyi Hong,Caiwen Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CudaForge is a training-free multi-agent workflow that uses LLMs to automatically generate and optimize CUDA kernels, achieving high correctness and significant speedups over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual CUDA kernel design is costly and time-consuming for AI applications like LLM training, while existing automatic approaches produce inefficient kernels with high computational overhead and poor generalization.

Method: A multi-agent workflow with two LLM agents (Coder and Judge) that iteratively generate, test, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels using hardware feedback from Nsight Compute metrics.

Result: Achieves 97.6% correctness, 1.68× average speedup over PyTorch baselines, strong generalization across GPUs and base models, with low cost (26.5 minutes and $0.3 per kernel).

Conclusion: Multi-agent, training-free workflows enable cost-effective, generalizable, and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization, surpassing state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Developing efficient CUDA kernels is increasingly critical for AI
applications such as large-scale LLM training. However, manual kernel design is
both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage
LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation,
however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational
overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose
CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and
optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human
experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing
correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More
specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that
iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating
hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive
evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,
achieves 97.6\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\times$
speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art
models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed,
CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090,
3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4,
QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an
optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \$
0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that
costs 6 H100 hours and \$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that
multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable,
and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization. Code available at

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on AVEC 2019 dataset with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, outperforming previous transfer learning and multi-task learning baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed RAG framework effectively enhances emotional representation and interpretability in depression detection while overcoming computational and domain limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning has shown promise in depression detection by
integrating text, audio, and video signals. Recent work leverages sentiment
analysis to enhance emotional understanding, yet suffers from high
computational cost, domain mismatch, and static knowledge limitations. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework. Given a depression-related text, our method retrieves semantically
relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset and uses a Large Language

enriches emotional representation and improves interpretability. Experiments on
the AVEC 2019 dataset show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, surpassing previous transfer learning and

*Doulaye Dembélé*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using eigenvalues entropy as an evaluation measure for classification problems, particularly effective for imbalanced datasets, with relationships established to traditional metrics like sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and Gini index.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation measures for classification methods are often less accurate when dealing with imbalanced class datasets, creating a need for more robust evaluation metrics.

Method: The authors use eigenvalues entropy as an evaluation measure for both binary and multi-class classification problems, establishing mathematical relationships between eigenvalues and conventional metrics.

Result: The proposed eigenvalues entropy measure shows better performance than standard evaluation measures across various data examples, and provides an estimate of the confusion matrix to address class imbalance issues.

Conclusion: Eigenvalues entropy is a superior evaluation measure for classification problems, especially for imbalanced datasets, outperforming traditional gold standard metrics.

Abstract: Classification is a machine learning method used in many practical
applications: text mining, handwritten character recognition, face recognition,
pattern classification, scene labeling, computer vision, natural langage
processing. A classifier prediction results and training set information are
often used to get a contingency table which is used to quantify the method
quality through an evaluation measure. Such measure, typically a numerical
value, allows to choose a suitable method among several. Many evaluation
measures available in the literature are less accurate for a dataset with
imbalanced classes. In this paper, the eigenvalues entropy is used as an
evaluation measure for a binary or a multi-class problem. For a binary problem,
relations are given between the eigenvalues and some commonly used measures,
the sensitivity, the specificity, the area under the operating receiver
characteristic curve and the Gini index. A by-product result of this paper is
an estimate of the confusion matrix to deal with the curse of the imbalanced
classes. Various data examples are used to show the better performance of the
proposed evaluation measure over the gold standard measures available in the
literature.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends a statistical framework to include underspecification (model variability due to random initialization/training) when evaluating machine learning performance in medical imaging, showing that even small seed variability significantly increases evidence needed for superiority claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning methods in medical imaging often report performance gains that may be false positives, and existing analyses don't account for underspecification - where models with similar validation scores behave differently on unseen data due to training randomness.

Method: Extend a recent statistical framework modeling false outperformance claims to include underspecification as an additional variance component, using simulations to analyze the impact.

Result: Simulations demonstrate that even modest seed variability (~1%) substantially increases the evidence required to support superiority claims in medical imaging systems.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the need for explicit modeling of training variance when validating medical imaging systems to ensure statistical robustness of performance claims.

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied in medical imaging, yet
many reported improvements lack statistical robustness: recent works have
highlighted that small but significant performance gains are highly likely to
be false positives. However, these analyses do not take
\emph{underspecification} into account -- the fact that models achieving
similar validation scores may behave differently on unseen data due to random
initialization or training dynamics. Here, we extend a recent statistical
framework modeling false outperformance claims to include underspecification as
an additional variance component. Our simulations demonstrate that even modest
seed variability ($\sim1\%$) substantially increases the evidence required to
support superiority claims. Our findings underscore the need for explicit
modeling of training variance when validating medical imaging systems.

TL;DR: Neural Green's Function is a neural solution operator for linear PDEs that mimics Green's functions, achieving superior generalization across diverse geometries and functions while being much faster than numerical solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a neural operator that can generalize well across unseen source/boundary functions and irregular geometries for linear PDEs, overcoming limitations of existing learning-based methods.

Method: Extracts per-point features from volumetric point clouds and predicts a decomposition of the solution operator, which is applied via numerical integration to evaluate solutions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators in thermal analysis, achieving 13.9% average error reduction across shape categories and being up to 350x faster than numerical solvers.

Conclusion: The proposed Neural Green's Function framework provides robust, efficient generalization for linear PDEs by being agnostic to specific training functions and leveraging domain geometry information.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Green's Function, a neural solution operator for linear
partial differential equations (PDEs) whose differential operators admit
eigendecompositions. Inspired by Green's functions, the solution operators of
linear PDEs that depend exclusively on the domain geometry, we design Neural
Green's Function to imitate their behavior, achieving superior generalization
across diverse irregular geometries and source and boundary functions.
Specifically, Neural Green's Function extracts per-point features from a
volumetric point cloud representing the problem domain and uses them to predict
a decomposition of the solution operator, which is subsequently applied to
evaluate solutions via numerical integration. Unlike recent learning-based
solution operators, which often struggle to generalize to unseen source or
boundary functions, our framework is, by design, agnostic to the specific
functions used during training, enabling robust and efficient generalization.
In the steady-state thermal analysis of mechanical part geometries from the MCB
dataset, Neural Green's Function outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators,
achieving an average error reduction of 13.9\% across five shape categories,
while being up to 350 times faster than a numerical solver that requires

TL;DR: DeepContour is a hybrid framework that combines deep learning with contour integral methods to efficiently solve large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems by automatically optimizing integration contours using spectral prediction and kernel density estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contour integral methods for solving Generalized Eigenvalue Problems are efficient but critically depend on proper integration contour selection, which is challenging without prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution, leading to computational overhead and accuracy issues.

Method: DeepContour uses a Fourier Neural Operator to predict spectral distribution, applies Kernel Density Estimation to automatically determine optimal integration contours, and then guides contour integral solvers with these optimized contours.

Result: The method achieves up to 5.63× speedup in solving Generalized Eigenvalue Problems across diverse challenging scientific datasets, demonstrating significant acceleration while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: This work pioneers an efficient and robust paradigm for tackling high-dimensional generalized eigenvalue problems by combining deep learning's predictive power with classical solvers' numerical rigor.

Abstract: Solving large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) is a fundamental
yet computationally prohibitive task in science and engineering. As a promising
direction, contour integral (CI) methods, such as the CIRR algorithm, offer an
efficient and parallelizable framework. However, their performance is
critically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper
selection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur
significant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To
address this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that
integrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density
Estimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first
employs a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral
distribution of a given GEP. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is
applied to the predicted spectrum to automatically and systematically determine
proper integration contours. Finally, these optimized contours guide the CI
solver to efficiently find the desired eigenvalues. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on diverse challenging scientific problems. In our
main experiments, DeepContour accelerates GEP solving across multiple datasets,
achieving up to a 5.63$\times$ speedup. By combining the predictive power of
deep learning with the numerical rigor of classical solvers, this work pioneers
an efficient and robust paradigm for tackling difficult generalized eigenvalue
involving matrices of high dimension.

TL;DR: A diffusion model-based trajectory generation framework that incorporates dynamic population distribution constraints to generate high-fidelity human mobility trajectories while addressing privacy and data quality issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world trajectory data faces privacy concerns, high acquisition costs, and quality issues. Existing methods focus on individual movement patterns but neglect the significant influence of population distribution on mobility behavior.

Method: Proposes a diffusion model framework with spatial graph construction for spatial correlation and a dynamic population distribution aware denoising network to capture spatiotemporal dependencies and population impact during denoising.

Result: Extensive experiments show generated trajectories closely resemble real-world trajectories in critical statistical metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms by over 54%.

Conclusion: Integrating dynamic population distribution constraints into trajectory generation significantly improves fidelity and realism, providing a practical solution to privacy and data acquisition challenges in human mobility analysis.

Abstract: Human trajectory data is crucial in urban planning, traffic engineering, and
public health. However, directly using real-world trajectory data often faces
challenges such as privacy concerns, data acquisition costs, and data quality.
A practical solution to these challenges is trajectory generation, a method
developed to simulate human mobility behaviors. Existing trajectory generation
methods mainly focus on capturing individual movement patterns but often
overlook the influence of population distribution on trajectory generation. In
reality, dynamic population distribution reflects changes in population density
across different regions, significantly impacting individual mobility behavior.
Thus, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework based on a diffusion
model, which integrates the dynamic population distribution constraints to
guide high-fidelity generation outcomes. Specifically, we construct a spatial
graph to enhance the spatial correlation of trajectories. Then, we design a
dynamic population distribution aware denoising network to capture the
spatiotemporal dependencies of human mobility behavior as well as the impact of
population distribution in the denoising process. Extensive experiments show
that the trajectories generated by our model can resemble real-world
trajectories in terms of some critical statistical metrics, outperforming
state-of-the-art algorithms by over 54%.

TL;DR: FineXL provides fine-grained natural language explanations for personalized image generation models, identifying multiple aspects of personalization with quantitative scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized image generation models lack explainability, and current natural language explanations are too coarse-grained to identify multiple aspects and varying levels of personalization.

Method: FineXL technique provides natural language descriptions for each distinct aspect of personalization along with quantitative scores indicating the level of each aspect.

Result: FineXL improves the accuracy of explainability by 56% across different personalization scenarios applied to multiple types of image generation models.

Conclusion: FineXL successfully addresses the limitation of coarse-grained explainability by providing fine-grained natural language explanations with quantitative personalization scores.

Abstract: Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order
to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized
models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such
explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is
difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is
a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural
language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely
identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels
of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we
present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained
e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image
generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each
distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating
the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that
FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different
personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic generalization-guided reward design for rule-based reinforcement learning to train tool-augmented LLMs, achieving significant performance improvements over supervised fine-tuning and RL-with-SFT approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised fine-tuning approaches for tool-augmented LLMs struggle to generalize effectively to unfamiliar or complex tool-use scenarios, while reinforcement learning shows promise for enhancing reasoning and generalization capabilities.

Method: Proposed dynamic generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL that progressively shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns, and introduced Tool-Zero series models trained by scaling up RL from base models without post-training.

Result: Achieved over 7% performance improvement compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental settings, with consistent gains across cross-dataset and intra-dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: Pure RL can effectively elicit LLMs' intrinsic reasoning capabilities and enhance tool-agnostic generalization, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: Training tool-augmented LLMs has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
language models' capabilities for complex tasks. The current supervised
fine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets
to train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize
effectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently,
reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and
generalization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure
RL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and
enhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic
generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively
shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on
this design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained
to enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL
from Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training). Experimental
results demonstrate that our models achieve over 7% performance improvement
compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental
settings. These gains are consistently replicated across cross-dataset and
intra-dataset evaluations, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our
methods.

*Hasan Tutar,Caner Erden,Ümit Şentürk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning model was developed to objectively determine sample size in qualitative research, replacing the subjective concept of data saturation with a systematic approach using 10 key parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency and lack of rigor in qualitative research sample size determination, which traditionally relies on the ambiguous principle of data saturation.

Method: Developed an ensemble ML model using 10 parameters evaluated on ordinal scale, trained on dataset from 5 qualitative approaches (Case Study, Grounded Theory, Phenomenology, Narrative Research, Ethnography) with preprocessing and outlier removal.

Result: KNN, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree algorithms achieved high explanatory power (Test R2 ~ 0.85), with feature importance confirming research design type and information power as most critical factors.

Conclusion: Proposes a web-based computational application as decision support system to standardize sample size justification, enhance transparency, and strengthen qualitative research through evidence-based decision-making.

Abstract: The determination of sample size in qualitative research has traditionally
relied on the subjective and often ambiguous principle of data saturation,
which can lead to inconsistencies and threaten methodological rigor. This study
introduces a new, systematic model based on machine learning (ML) to make this
process more objective. Utilizing a dataset derived from five fundamental
qualitative research approaches - namely, Case Study, Grounded Theory,
Phenomenology, Narrative Research, and Ethnographic Research - we developed an
ensemble learning model. Ten critical parameters, including research scope,
information power, and researcher competence, were evaluated using an ordinal
scale and used as input features. After thorough preprocessing and outlier
removal, multiple ML algorithms were trained and compared. The K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and
Decision Tree (DT) algorithms showed the highest explanatory power (Test R2 ~
0.85), effectively modeling the complex, non-linear relationships involved in
qualitative sampling decisions. Feature importance analysis confirmed the vital
roles of research design type and information power, providing quantitative
validation of key theoretical assumptions in qualitative methodology. The study
concludes by proposing a conceptual framework for a web-based computational
application designed to serve as a decision support system for qualitative
researchers, journal reviewers, and thesis advisors. This model represents a
significant step toward standardizing sample size justification, enhancing
transparency, and strengthening the epistemological foundation of qualitative
inquiry through evidence-based, systematic decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training LLMs on harder problems only makes them excessively verbose. Retaining easy problems acts as implicit length regularization, achieving baseline accuracy with nearly 2x shorter outputs without explicit length penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs trained for step-by-step reasoning become excessively verbose, increasing inference costs. Standard RLVR pipelines filter out easy problems, causing models to conflate longer thinking with better thinking.

Method: Retain and modestly up-weight moderately easy problems as implicit length regularizer. Expose model to solvable short-chain tasks to constrain output distribution and prevent verbosity.

Result: Achieved baseline pass@1 AIME25 accuracy while generating solutions that are on average nearly twice as short, demonstrating emergent brevity without explicit length penalization.

Conclusion: Simple data curation strategy provides effective length regularization, enabling models to solve harder problems without inflating output length, reducing inference costs while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained for step-by-step reasoning often become
excessively verbose, raising inference cost. Standard Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines filter out ``easy'' problems for
training efficiency, leaving the model to train primarily on harder problems
that require longer reasoning chains. This skews the output length distribution
upward, resulting in a \textbf{model that conflates ``thinking longer'' with
``thinking better''}. In this work, we show that retaining and modestly
up-weighting moderately easy problems acts as an implicit length regularizer.
Exposing the model to solvable short-chain tasks constrains its output
distribution and prevents runaway verbosity. The result is
\textbf{\emph{emergent brevity for free}}: the model learns to solve harder
problems without inflating the output length, \textbf{ despite the absence of
any explicit length penalization}. RLVR experiments using this approach on
\textit{Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507} (with a 16k token limit) achieve baseline
pass@1 AIME25 accuracy while generating solutions that are, on average, nearly
twice as short. The code is available at

*Tiberiu Musat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Grokking phenomenon explained through constrained optimization: gradient descent minimizes weight norm on zero-loss manifold after memorization, with proven dynamics in small learning rate limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the puzzling grokking phenomenon where neural networks generalize only after long delay following complete memorization, and uncover the precise underlying dynamics.

Method: Formal proof in infinitesimal learning rate/weight decay limit, approximation to decouple parameter dynamics, closed-form expression for first layer dynamics in two-layer networks.

Result: Experiments confirm simulated training using predicted gradients reproduces both delayed generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.

Conclusion: Post-memorization learning can be understood as constrained optimization where gradient descent minimizes weight norm on zero-loss manifold, providing theoretical foundation for grokking phenomenon.

Abstract: Grokking is a puzzling phenomenon in neural networks where full
generalization occurs only after a substantial delay following the complete
memorization of the training data. Previous research has linked this delayed
generalization to representation learning driven by weight decay, but the
precise underlying dynamics remain elusive. In this paper, we argue that
post-memorization learning can be understood through the lens of constrained
optimization: gradient descent effectively minimizes the weight norm on the
zero-loss manifold. We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally
small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this
regime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a
subset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we
derive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first
layer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training
process using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed
generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.

TL;DR: Proposed clustering approach for ALS patients using disease progression scores, integrating medical expertise and multiple distance measures, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in survival analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALS has limited treatments and variable patient responses, requiring personalized care. Research is hindered by small cohorts, sparse data, and lack of clear patient clusters. Existing clustering methods are limited in scope and number.

Method: Clustering approach that groups sequences using disease progression declarative score. Integrates medical expertise through multiple descriptive variables, investigates several distance measures combining variables using off-the-shelf distances and weak-supervised learning. Pairs distances with clustering methods and benchmarks against state-of-the-art techniques.

Result: Evaluation on 353 ALS patients from University Hospital of Tours shows method outperforms state-of-the-art in survival analysis while achieving comparable silhouette scores. Learned distances enhance relevance and interpretability for medical experts.

Conclusion: The proposed clustering approach effectively addresses limitations in ALS patient stratification, providing improved survival analysis results and more interpretable clusters for medical decision-making.

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe disease with a typical
survival of 3-5 years after symptom onset. Current treatments offer only
limited life extension, and the variability in patient responses highlights the
need for personalized care. However, research is hindered by small,
heterogeneous cohorts, sparse longitudinal data, and the lack of a clear
definition for clinically meaningful patient clusters. Existing clustering
methods remain limited in both scope and number. To address this, we propose a
clustering approach that groups sequences using a disease progression
declarative score. Our approach integrates medical expertise through multiple
descriptive variables, investigating several distance measures combining such
variables, both by reusing off-the-shelf distances and employing a
weak-supervised learning method. We pair these distances with clustering
methods and benchmark them against state-of-the-art techniques. The evaluation
of our approach on a dataset of 353 ALS patients from the University Hospital
of Tours, shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
survival analysis while achieving comparable silhouette scores. In addition,
the learned distances enhance the relevance and interpretability of results for
medical experts.

*Zihan Li,Mingyang Wan,Mingyu Gao,Zhongshan Chen,Xiangke Wang,Feifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COFAP is a universal deep learning framework that predicts gas adsorption in COFs using multi-modal structural and chemical features, outperforming previous methods without requiring gas-specific features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning for COF screening relies on time-consuming gas-specific features, limiting scalability and efficiency in high-throughput screening of the vast COF design space.

Method: COFAP extracts multi-modal structural and chemical features through deep learning and fuses them via cross-modal attention mechanism, eliminating the need for Henry coefficients or adsorption heat.

Result: COFAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the hypoCOFs dataset and reveals that high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within narrow ranges of pore size and surface area.

Conclusion: COFAP provides superior efficiency and accuracy for COF screening, with a weight-adjustable prioritization scheme for flexible application-specific ranking, making it directly deployable for crystalline porous materials.

Abstract: Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising adsorbents for gas
adsorption and separation, while identifying the optimal structures among their
vast design space requires efficient high-throughput screening. Conventional
machine-learning predictors rely heavily on specific gas-related features.
However, these features are time-consuming and limit scalability, leading to
inefficiency and labor-intensive processes. Herein, a universal COFs adsorption
prediction framework (COFAP) is proposed, which can extract multi-modal
structural and chemical features through deep learning, and fuse these
complementary features via cross-modal attention mechanism. Without Henry
coefficients or adsorption heat, COFAP sets a new SOTA by outperforming
previous approaches on hypoCOFs dataset. Based on COFAP, we also found that
high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within a narrow range of pore
size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme is also
developed to enable flexible, application-specific ranking of candidate COFs
for researchers. Superior efficiency and accuracy render COFAP directly
deployable in crystalline porous materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular disease is a critical global health concern requiring reliable and interpretable predictive models for early risk assessment.

Method: Developed a strategically weighted ensemble model combining tree-based methods (LightGBM, XGBoost) with CNN, trained on 229,781 patients with class imbalance management and feature engineering (22 to 25 features).

Result: Final ensemble achieves statistically significant improvement with Test AUC of 0.8371 (p=0.003) and high recall of 80.0%, particularly suited for screening.

Conclusion: The model delivers robust predictive performance and clinical transparency, making it suitable for real-world deployment in public health screening.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a critical global health concern,
demanding reliable and interpretable predictive models for early risk
assessment. This study presents a large-scale analysis using the Heart Disease
Health Indicators Dataset, developing a strategically weighted ensemble model
that combines tree-based methods (LightGBM, XGBoost) with a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to predict CVD risk. The model was trained on a
preprocessed dataset of 229,781 patients where the inherent class imbalance was
managed through strategic weighting and feature engineering enhanced the
original 22 features to 25. The final ensemble achieves a statistically
significant improvement over the best individual model, with a Test AUC of
0.8371 (p=0.003) and is particularly suited for screening with a high recall of
80.0%. To provide transparency and clinical interpretability, surrogate
decision trees and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used. The proposed
model delivers a combination of robust predictive performance and clinical
transparency by blending diverse learning architectures and incorporating
explainability through SHAP and surrogate decision trees, making it a strong
candidate for real-world deployment in public health screening.

TL;DR: EchoLSTM introduces Output-Conditioned Gating for self-reflection, enabling models to modulate memory gates based on past inferences, creating a stabilizing feedback loop that enhances long-range dependency modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RNNs and LSTMs struggle with long-range dependencies in sequences with noisy or misleading information, requiring more robust memory systems.

Method: Proposes Output-Conditioned Gating principle that enables self-reflection by modulating internal memory gates based on past inferences, combined with attention mechanism in EchoLSTM architecture.

Result: EchoLSTM achieves 69.0% accuracy on Distractor Signal Task (33 percentage points better than LSTM baseline) and 69.8% on ListOps benchmark (competitive with Transformer's 71.8% while being 5x more parameter-efficient).

Conclusion: The self-reflective mechanism in EchoLSTM creates a fundamentally more robust memory system that effectively handles long-range dependencies in noisy sequences.

Abstract: Standard Recurrent Neural Networks, including LSTMs, struggle to model
long-range dependencies, particularly in sequences containing noisy or
misleading information. We propose a new architectural principle,
Output-Conditioned Gating, which enables a model to perform self-reflection by
modulating its internal memory gates based on its own past inferences. This
creates a stabilizing feedback loop that enhances memory retention. Our final
model, the EchoLSTM, integrates this principle with an attention mechanism. We
evaluate the EchoLSTM on a series of challenging benchmarks. On a
custom-designed Distractor Signal Task, the EchoLSTM achieves 69.0% accuracy,
decisively outperforming a standard LSTM baseline by 33 percentage points.
Furthermore, on the standard ListOps benchmark, the EchoLSTM achieves
performance competitive with a modern Transformer model, 69.8% vs. 71.8%, while
being over 5 times more parameter-efficient. A final Trigger Sensitivity Test
provides qualitative evidence that our model's self-reflective mechanism leads
to a fundamentally more robust memory system.

*Arjun Rao,Marc Rußwurm,Konstantin Klemmer,Esther Rolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) for Earth observation, finding they typically have 2-10 intrinsic dimensions that correlate with downstream performance and can detect spatial artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite geographic INRs being used to create compact representations of Earth data, there's limited understanding of how much information they actually contain and where it's concentrated.

Method: The authors analyze the intrinsic dimension of geographic INRs with ambient dimensions between 256-512, examining how spatial resolution and input modalities affect dimensionality.

Result: Geographic INRs have intrinsic dimensions between 2-10, which are sensitive to spatial resolution and input modalities. The intrinsic dimension correlates with downstream task performance and can capture spatial artifacts.

Conclusion: Intrinsic dimension serves as an architecture-agnostic, label-free metric for evaluating information content in geographic INRs, enabling unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design.

Abstract: Within the context of representation learning for Earth observation,
geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) embed low-dimensional
location inputs (longitude, latitude) into high-dimensional embeddings, through
models trained on geo-referenced satellite, image or text data. Despite the
common aim of geographic INRs to distill Earth's data into compact,
learning-friendly representations, we lack an understanding of how much
information is contained in these Earth representations, and where that
information is concentrated. The intrinsic dimension of a dataset measures the
number of degrees of freedom required to capture its local variability,
regardless of the ambient high-dimensional space in which it is embedded. This
work provides the first study of the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic
INRs. Analyzing INRs with ambient dimension between 256 and 512, we find that
their intrinsic dimensions fall roughly between 2 and 10 and are sensitive to
changing spatial resolution and input modalities during INR pre-training.
Furthermore, we show that the intrinsic dimension of a geographic INR
correlates with downstream task performance and can capture spatial artifacts,
facilitating model evaluation and diagnostics. More broadly, our work offers an
architecture-agnostic, label-free metric of information content that can enable
unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design across INRs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroClean is an unsupervised EEG/LFP preprocessing pipeline that automatically removes artifacts while preserving task-relevant information, achieving 97% accuracy in motor task classification compared to 74% with raw data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG and LFP recordings suffer from various artifacts and noise, requiring automated preprocessing to ensure reliability and reproducibility while avoiding human intervention biases.

Method: Five-step pipeline including bandpass filtering, line noise filtering, bad channel rejection, efficient independent component analysis with automatic component rejection using a clustering algorithm, and machine learning classifier to preserve task-relevant information.

Result: Successfully removed common artifacts and achieved 97% accuracy in motor task classification using Multinomial Logistic Regression, significantly outperforming raw data (74% accuracy) and chance level (33.3%).

Conclusion: NeuroClean is a promising automated preprocessing pipeline that improves machine learning performance and generalization for EEG/LFP data analysis.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) are two widely
used techniques to record electrical activity from the brain. These signals are
used in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications.
However, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise
sources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is
proper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As
a means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP
preprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness
and reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to
mitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The
pipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and
line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an
efficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection
based on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to
ensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the
cleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline.
NeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover,
in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97%
accuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic
Regression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which
performed at 74% accuracy. These results show that NeuroClean is a promising
pipeline and workflow that can be applied to future work and studies to achieve
better generalization and performance on machine learning pipelines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bulk-boundary decomposition framework to analyze deep neural network training dynamics, separating data-independent intrinsic dynamics from data-dependent stochastic interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a new theoretical framework for understanding the fundamental training dynamics of deep neural networks by decomposing the complex optimization process into more interpretable components.

Method: Reorganizes the stochastic gradient descent Lagrangian into a bulk term (data-independent, capturing intrinsic dynamics from network architecture and activations) and a boundary term (data-dependent, reflecting stochastic interactions from training samples).

Result: The decomposition reveals the local and homogeneous structure underlying deep networks and enables the development of a field-theoretic formulation of neural dynamics.

Conclusion: The bulk-boundary decomposition provides a powerful framework for analyzing neural network training dynamics, exposing fundamental structural properties and enabling field-theoretic approaches to understanding deep learning.

Abstract: We present the bulk-boundary decomposition as a new framework for
understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks. Starting from the
stochastic gradient descent formulation, we show that the Lagrangian can be
reorganized into a data-independent bulk term and a data-dependent boundary
term. The bulk captures the intrinsic dynamics set by network architecture and
activation functions, while the boundary reflects stochastic interactions from
training samples at the input and output layers. This decomposition exposes the
local and homogeneous structure underlying deep networks. As a natural
extension, we develop a field-theoretic formulation of neural dynamics based on
this decomposition.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TapOut is a training-free dynamic speculative decoding algorithm that uses multi-armed bandits to intelligently select the optimal number of tokens to draft, achieving competitive speedups without hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic speculative decoding methods rely on hand-tuned thresholds that are costly to set and generalize poorly across models and domains, limiting the effectiveness of speculative decoding.

Method: TapOut uses an online, plug-and-play algorithm with multi-armed bandits to select among multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past reward and exploration.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse model pairs and datasets show TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups compared to established dynamic speculation baselines without hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: TapOut provides an effective, training-free solution for dynamic speculation policy selection that eliminates the need for sensitive threshold tuning while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLMs by using a lightweight draft model to
generate tokens autoregressively before verifying them in parallel with a
larger target model. However, determining the optimal number of tokens to draft
remains a key challenge limiting the approach's effectiveness. Dynamic
speculative decoding aims to intelligently decide how many tokens to draft to
achieve maximum speedups. Existing methods often rely on hand-tuned, sensitive
thresholds (e.g., token entropy), which are costly to set and generalize poorly
across models and domains. We propose TapOut, an online, training-free,
plug-and-play algorithm for dynamic speculation policy selection using
multi-armed bandits. Our approach employs a meta-algorithm that selects among
multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past reward and
exploration. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse model pairs and
datasets, showing that TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups
compared to well-established dynamic speculation baselines without any
hyperparameter tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Emergent misalignment (EM) in LLMs exhibits cross-task linear structure with shared parameter directions across different harmful datasets, enabling harmful generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental mechanisms enabling harmful generalization across disparate domains in large language models after fine-tuning on narrow harmful datasets.

Method: Adopted a geometric perspective to study EM, analyzing cosine similarities of weight updates, principal angles, projection overlaps, and linear mode connectivity across different misalignment tasks.

Result: Found strong convergence in EM parameters across tasks with high cosine similarities, shared lower-dimensional subspaces, and functional equivalence via linear mode connectivity where interpolated models maintain coherent misaligned behavior.

Conclusion: EM arises from different narrow tasks discovering the same set of shared parameter directions, suggesting harmful behaviors are organized into specific, predictable regions of the weight landscape.

Abstract: Recent work has discovered that large language models can develop broadly
misaligned behaviors after being fine-tuned on narrowly harmful datasets, a
phenomenon known as emergent misalignment (EM). However, the fundamental
mechanisms enabling such harmful generalization across disparate domains remain
poorly understood. In this work, we adopt a geometric perspective to study EM
and demonstrate that it exhibits a fundamental cross-task linear structure in
how harmful behavior is encoded across different datasets. Specifically, we
find a strong convergence in EM parameters across tasks, with the fine-tuned
weight updates showing relatively high cosine similarities, as well as shared
lower-dimensional subspaces as measured by their principal angles and
projection overlaps. Furthermore, we also show functional equivalence via
linear mode connectivity, wherein interpolated models across narrow
misalignment tasks maintain coherent, broadly misaligned behavior. Our results
indicate that EM arises from different narrow tasks discovering the same set of
shared parameter directions, suggesting that harmful behaviors may be organized
into specific, predictable regions of the weight landscape. By revealing this
fundamental connection between parametric geometry and behavioral outcomes, we
hope our work catalyzes further research on parameter space interpretability
and weight-based interventions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new path-coordinated continual learning framework that combines NTK theory, Wilson confidence intervals, and multi-metric path evaluation to address catastrophic forgetting, achieving 66.7% accuracy with only 23.4% forgetting on Split-CIFAR10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting is a fundamental problem in continual learning where neural networks forget previously learned tasks when trained on new tasks.

Method: Proposes a path-coordinated framework uniting Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory for principled plasticity bounds, statistical validation via Wilson confidence intervals, and multi-metric path quality evaluation.

Result: Achieves 66.7% average accuracy with 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10, competitive with state-of-the-art. Shows decreasing forgetting trend (27% to 18%) as task sequence progresses. Validates 80% of paths with statistical guarantees and maintains 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks.

Conclusion: NTK condition numbers are predictive indicators of learning capacity limits with critical threshold at >10^11. The framework identifies core capacity limits and offers actionable insights for adaptive regularization enhancement.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the fundamental issues of continual
learning because neural networks forget the tasks learned previously when
trained on new tasks. The proposed framework is a new path-coordinated
framework of continual learning that unites the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
theory of principled plasticity bounds, statistical validation by Wilson
confidence intervals, and evaluation of path quality by the use of multiple
metrics. Experimental evaluation shows an average accuracy of 66.7% at the cost
of 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10, a huge improvement over the
baseline and competitive performance achieved, which is very close to
state-of-the-art results. Further, it is found out that NTK condition numbers
are predictive indicators of learning capacity limits, showing the existence of
a critical threshold at condition number $>10^{11}$. It is interesting to note
that the proposed strategy shows a tendency of lowering forgetting as the
sequence of tasks progresses (27% to 18%), which is a system stabilization. The
framework validates 80% of discovered paths with a rigorous statistical
guarantee and maintains 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks. The core
capacity limits of the continual learning environment are determined in the
analysis, and actionable insights to enhance the adaptive regularization are
offered.

### [124] [RobustFSM: Submodular Maximization in Federated Setting with Malicious Clients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02029)
*Duc A. Tran,Dung Truong,Duy Le*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RobustFSM is a federated submodular maximization solution that protects against client attacks in decentralized settings where data owners have different quality definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address vulnerabilities in federated submodular maximization where malicious clients can share fake information, similar to backdoor attacks in federated learning but with unique challenges due to submodular characteristics.

Method: Proposed RobustFSM framework that provides robustness against various practical client attacks through empirical evaluation using real-world datasets.

Result: Numerical results show RobustFSM substantially outperforms conventional federated algorithms under severe attacks, with improvements up to 200% depending on dataset and attack scenarios.

Conclusion: RobustFSM effectively addresses security vulnerabilities in federated submodular maximization and provides significant performance improvements over traditional methods when dealing with malicious clients.

Abstract: Submodular maximization is an optimization problem benefiting many machine
learning applications, where we seek a small subset best representing an
extremely large dataset. We focus on the federated setting where the data are
locally owned by decentralized clients who have their own definitions for the
quality of representability. This setting requires repetitive aggregation of
local information computed by the clients. While the main motivation is to
respect the privacy and autonomy of the clients, the federated setting is
vulnerable to client misbehaviors: malicious clients might share fake
information. An analogy is backdoor attack in conventional federated learning,
but our challenge differs freshly due to the unique characteristics of
submodular maximization. We propose RobustFSM, a federated submodular
maximization solution that is robust to various practical client attacks. Its
performance is substantiated with an empirical evaluation study using
real-world datasets. Numerical results show that the solution quality of
RobustFSM substantially exceeds that of the conventional federated algorithm
when attacks are severe. The degree of this improvement depends on the dataset
and attack scenarios, which can be as high as 200%

*Elham Gholamzadeh,Kajal Singla,Nico Scherf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict interspecies microbial interactions from monoculture growth data, phylogeny, and pairwise interaction data, achieving 80.44% F1-score for binary classification and complex interaction types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting interspecies interactions is crucial for understanding microbial community structure and activity, but remains a key challenge in microbial ecology.

Method: Constructed edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions and used Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to leverage shared information across co-culture experiments. Trained on a large dataset of 7,500+ interactions between 20 species across 40 carbon conditions.

Result: Achieved 80.44% F1-score for predicting interaction directions, significantly outperforming conventional XGBoost models (72.76% F1-score). Model can predict both binary interactions (positive/negative) and complex types (mutualism, competition, parasitism).

Conclusion: GNNs are a powerful approach for predicting microbial interspecies interactions, demonstrating superior performance over traditional machine learning methods and enabling classification of complex interaction types.

Abstract: Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology,
as these interactions are critical to determining the structure and activity of
microbial communities. In this work, we used data on monoculture growth
capabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a
negative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the
largest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising
over 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups
co-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the
work of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We
construct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage
shared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to
predict modes of interaction. Our model can not only predict binary
interactions (positive/negative) but also classify more complex interaction
types such as mutualism, competition, and parasitism. Our initial results were
encouraging, achieving an F1-score of 80.44%. This significantly outperforms
comparable methods in the literature, including conventional Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) models, which reported an F1-score of 72.76%.

*Saeed Razavikia,José Mairton Barros Da Silva Junior,Carlo Fischione*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VecComp extends ChannelComp framework by integrating multiple-antenna technology to enable efficient vector function computation with linear complexity scaling and robustness against channel fading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ChannelComp is limited to scalar functions and susceptible to channel fading, while many applications require vector-based computations. There's a need for a framework that supports vector functions while maintaining computational efficiency and robustness.

Method: Generalized ChannelComp framework by integrating multiple-antenna technology to enable vector function computation. The approach ensures computational complexity scales only linearly with vector dimension and provides robustness against channel impairments.

Result: Established non-asymptotic upper bound on mean squared error, confirming computation efficiency under fading conditions. Numerical experiments demonstrate improved vector function computation and fading compensation over noisy multiple-access channels.

Conclusion: VecComp successfully extends ChannelComp to support vector computations while maintaining computational efficiency and robustness, making it suitable for high-dimensional data-centric applications.

Abstract: Recently, the ChannelComp framework has proposed digital over-the-air
computation by designing digital modulations that enable the computation of
arbitrary functions. Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which
is restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of
computational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication
systems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local
information processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp
is currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous
data-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is
susceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of
the ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with
multiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector
function computation but also ensures scalability in the computational
complexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such,
VecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel
impairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric
applications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared
error of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel
conditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in
improving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over
noisy and fading multiple-access channels.

*M. Z. Haider,M. U. Ghouri,Tayyaba Noreen,M. Salman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QEGM is a hybrid classical-quantum generative model that improves rare-event modeling by combining deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits, achieving better tail distribution capture and reduced mode collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare events like financial crashes and climate extremes are difficult to model due to scarcity and heavy-tailed distributions, with classical deep generative models struggling to capture these occurrences effectively.

Method: Hybrid classical-quantum framework with deep latent-variable models integrated with variational quantum circuits, featuring hybrid loss function for reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, plus quantum randomness-driven noise injection.

Result: QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by up to 50% compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion), while improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: QEGM demonstrates potential as a principled approach for rare-event prediction, offering robustness beyond purely classical methods through quantum-enhanced modeling capabilities.

Abstract: Rare events such as financial crashes, climate extremes, and biological
anomalies are notoriously difficult to model due to their scarcity and
heavy-tailed distributions. Classical deep generative models often struggle to
capture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or
producing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the
Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework
that integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits.
The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that
jointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2)
quantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and
mitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical
parameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are
optimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic
Gaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and
protein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by
up to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion),
while improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration. These findings
highlight the potential of QEGM as a principled approach for rare-event
prediction, offering robustness beyond what is achievable with purely classical
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flashlight is a compiler-native framework that automatically generates efficient FlashAttention-style kernels for arbitrary attention-based programs in PyTorch, supporting more general attention patterns than previous approaches like FlexAttention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention optimization approaches like FlashAttention require specialized kernels or hand-tuned implementations, and even FlexAttention only supports a limited subset of attention variants using static templates, creating a gap for efficiently supporting diverse attention patterns.

Method: Flashlight leverages PyTorch's compilation workflow to automatically fuse and tile attention computations transparently, generating fused kernels for arbitrary attention-based programs without relying on static templates or predefined kernel specializations.

Result: Flashlight produces kernels with competitive or superior performance to FlexAttention while supporting all variants expressible in FlexAttention plus more general, data-dependent attention formulations that FlexAttention cannot handle.

Conclusion: Flashlight enables developers to rapidly explore new attention models without sacrificing performance, offering the flexibility of native PyTorch code while automatically generating efficient attention kernels.

Abstract: Bad charactors when submitting to arXiv: Attention is a fundamental building
block of large language models (LLMs), so there have been many efforts to
implement it efficiently. For example, FlashAttention leverages tiling and
kernel fusion to optimize attention. Recently, a number of variants of
attention have been introduced to enhance model quality or efficiency.
Supporting them efficiently remains difficult since they usually require
specialized kernels or hand-tuned implementations. FlexAttention recently
addressed part of this gap by using static programming templates to support
FlashAttention-like kernels for a subset of attention variants.
  In this paper, we introduce Flashlight, a compiler-native framework within
the PyTorch ecosystem that automatically generates fused, FlashAttention-style
kernels for arbitrary attention-based programs, without relying on static
templates or predefined kernel specializations. Flashlight leverages PyTorch's
compilation workflow to fuse and tile attention computations transparently,
enabling efficient execution for diverse attention patterns. Not only does it
support all variants expressible in the FlexAttention model but it also handles
more general, data-dependent attention formulations that are beyond the
capabilities of FlexAttention.
  Our results show that Flashlight produces kernels with competitive or
superior performance to FlexAttention, while offering the flexibility of native
PyTorch code, enabling developers to rapidly explore new attention models
without sacrificing performance.

### [129] [Regularization Through Reasoning: Systematic Improvements in Language Model Classification via Explanation-Enhanced Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02044)
*Vivswan Shah,Randy Cogill,Hanwei Yue,Gopinath Chennupati,Rinat Khaziev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adding explanations to labels during fine-tuning improves LLM classification performance, but surprisingly, even random token sequences that mimic explanation structure provide similar benefits by encouraging richer intermediate computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether attaching brief explanations to labels during fine-tuning yields better classification models than label-only training.

Method: Fine-tuned a 7B-parameter model using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, testing across six conversational datasets. Compared label-only training with label-plus-explanation training, including experiments with random token sequences that maintain vocabulary but lack semantic coherence.

Result: Label-plus-explanation training consistently outperformed label-only baselines across 18 dataset/task settings. Surprisingly, even pseudo-explanations (syntactically incoherent but vocabulary-aligned text) improved accuracy over label-only training and narrowed much of the gap to true explanations.

Conclusion: Explanation-augmented fine-tuning improves LLM classification accuracy and reliability, with gains arising more from structural properties than semantic meaning - the extra token budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a regularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts.

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs for classification typically maps inputs directly to labels.
We ask whether attaching brief explanations to each label during fine-tuning
yields better models. We evaluate conversational response quality along three
axes: naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence, each rated on
5-point scales. Using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, we fine-tune
a 7B-parameter model and test across six diverse conversational datasets.
Across 18 dataset, task settings, label-plus-explanation training outperforms
label-only baselines.
  A central and unexpected result concerns random tokens. We replace
human-written explanations with text that is syntactically incoherent yet
vocabulary-aligned with the originals (e.g., shuffled or bag-of-words
variants). Despite lacking semantics, these pseudo-explanations still improve
accuracy over label-only training and often narrow much of the gap to true
explanations. The effect persists across datasets and training seeds,
indicating that gains arise less from meaning than from structure: the extra
token budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a
regularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts.
  Internal analyses support this view: explanation-augmented models exhibit
higher activation entropy in intermediate layers alongside sharper predictive
mass at the output layer, consistent with increased deliberation before
decision. Overall, explanation-augmented fine-tuning, whether with genuine
rationales or carefully constructed random token sequences, improves accuracy
and reliability for LLM classification while clarifying how token-level
scaffolding shapes computation during inference.

*Hamidreza Sadeghsalehi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework serves as both sensor optimizer and automated data auditor, discovering severe dataset biases in gait analysis while proposing novel sensor synergies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Objective gait analysis using wearable sensors and AI is critical for managing neurological and orthopedic conditions, but models are vulnerable to hidden dataset biases and task-specific sensor optimization remains challenging.

Method: Multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework applied to the Voisard et al. (2025) multi-cohort gait dataset on four clinical tasks (PD, OA, CVA screening; PD vs CVA differential).

Result: The model's attention mechanism discovered a severe dataset confound - for OA and CVA screening, it assigned >70% attention to Right Foot while ignoring Left Foot (<0.1% attention), reflecting a severe laterality bias in the public dataset (e.g., 15 of 15 right-sided OA).

Conclusion: The primary contribution is methodological, demonstrating that interpretable frameworks can automatically audit dataset integrity. As secondary finding, the model proposes novel data-driven sensor synergies (e.g., Head plus Foot for PD screening) for future optimized protocols.

Abstract: Objective gait analysis using wearable sensors and AI is critical for
managing neurological and orthopedic conditions. However, models are vulnerable
to hidden dataset biases, and task-specific sensor optimization remains a
challenge. We propose a multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework
that functions as both a sensor optimizer and an automated data auditor.
Applied to the Voisard et al. (2025) multi-cohort gait dataset on four clinical
tasks (PD, OA, CVA screening; PD vs CVA differential), the model's attention
mechanism quantitatively discovered a severe dataset confound. For OA and CVA
screening, tasks where bilateral assessment is clinically essential, the model
assigned more than 70 percent attention to the Right Foot while statistically
ignoring the Left Foot (less than 0.1 percent attention, 95 percent CI
[0.0-0.1]). This was not a clinical finding but a direct reflection of a severe
laterality bias (for example, 15 of 15 right-sided OA) in the public dataset.
The primary contribution of this work is methodological, demonstrating that an
interpretable framework can automatically audit dataset integrity. As a
secondary finding, the model proposes novel, data-driven sensor synergies (for
example, Head plus Foot for PD screening) as hypotheses for future optimized
protocols.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A solver for maximizing real-valued functions of binary variables using an estimator trained on expected deviation from optimality rather than policy values or solved instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient solver for binary optimization problems that doesn't require calculating policy values or relying on pre-solved instances, making it more scalable and practical.

Method: Uses an algorithm that estimates optimal objective values from the distribution of objectives and sub-instances, training the estimator with an inequality that enables using expected total deviation from optimality as the loss function.

Result: The proposed solver can effectively maximize real-valued functions of binary variables without needing to compute policy values or use solved instances as training data.

Conclusion: This approach provides a novel framework for binary optimization that circumvents the need for policy value calculations and pre-solved instances, potentially enabling more efficient and scalable solvers for complex binary optimization problems.

Abstract: The paper is about developing a solver for maximizing a real-valued function
of binary variables. The solver relies on an algorithm that estimates the
optimal objective-function value of instances from the underlying distribution
of objectives and their respective sub-instances. The training of the estimator
is based on an inequality that facilitates the use of the expected total
deviation from optimality conditions as a loss function rather than the
objective-function itself. Thus, it does not calculate values of policies, nor
does it rely on solved instances.

*Jucheng Shen,Yeonju Ro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: One-Shot Dynamic Thresholding (OSDT) accelerates masked diffusion language models by calibrating confidence thresholds on one sequence and reusing them across inputs, achieving significant speedups with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current masked diffusion language models have fixed decoding steps and show strong confidence fluctuations across blocks and steps, with similar confidence trajectories across different inputs within the same dataset.

Method: OSDT calibrates dynamic confidence thresholds on a single input sequence and applies them to subsequent inputs with negligible overhead, leveraging reusable task-level confidence signatures.

Result: OSDT achieves superior accuracy-throughput trade-offs: +24% tokens/s on GSM8K at best accuracy, +45% on GPQA with comparable accuracy, and +50% on HumanEval with modest accuracy gap.

Conclusion: The findings suggest broader opportunities to leverage reusable task-level confidence signatures for more general-purpose algorithmic and systems innovations in diffusion decoding.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are becoming competitive with their
autoregressive counterparts but typically decode with fixed steps and
sequential unmasking. To accelerate decoding, recent work such as Fast-dLLM
enables parallel decoding via a static global confidence threshold, yet we
observe strong block- and step-wise confidence fluctuations and, within a
dataset, near-identical confidence trajectories across inputs as measured by
cosine similarity. Motivated by these observations, we introduce One-Shot
Dynamic Thresholding (OSDT), which calibrates thresholds on a single sequence
and applies them to subsequent inputs with negligible overhead. On GPQA, GSM8K,
and HumanEval, OSDT attains superior accuracy-throughput trade-offs (+24%
tokens/s on GSM8K at the best accuracy, +45% on GPQA with comparable accuracy,
and +50% on HumanEval with a modest accuracy gap). Beyond these results, our
findings suggest broader opportunities to leverage reusable task-level
confidence signatures for more general-purpose algorithmic and systems
innovations in diffusion decoding.

TL;DR: A framework for incorporating physical knowledge directly into loss functions for machine learning tasks on scientific systems like molecules and spins, using energy-based formulations derived from thermal equilibrium assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively leverage prior physical knowledge in ML applications to scientific domains, moving beyond architectural-level incorporation to direct loss function integration.

Method: Derive energy loss functions assuming data samples are in thermal equilibrium with respect to approximate energy landscapes, using reverse KL divergence with Boltzmann distributions around data to obtain energy differences between data and model predictions.

Result: Significant improvements over baselines in molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction tasks, with physically grounded loss functions that respect physical symmetries.

Conclusion: The proposed energy-based loss framework provides architecture-agnostic, computationally efficient, and physically meaningful objectives that better align with valid configurations while respecting physical symmetries.

Abstract: Effectively leveraging prior knowledge of a system's physics is crucial for
applications of machine learning to scientific domains. Previous approaches
mostly focused on incorporating physical insights at the architectural level.
In this paper, we propose a framework to leverage physical information directly
into the loss function for prediction and generative modeling tasks on systems
like molecules and spins. We derive energy loss functions assuming that each
data sample is in thermal equilibrium with respect to an approximate energy
landscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution
around the data, we obtain the loss as an energy difference between the data
and the model predictions. This perspective also recasts traditional objectives
like MSE as energy-based, but with a physically meaningless energy. In
contrast, our formulation yields physically grounded loss functions with
gradients that better align with valid configurations, while being
architecture-agnostic and computationally efficient. The energy loss functions
also inherently respect physical symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on
molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction and report significant
improvements over baselines.

TL;DR: CCS is reformulated as an eigenproblem based on relative contrast consistency, yielding closed-form solutions that match CCS performance while avoiding initialization sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand CCS mechanisms and extend its applicability by clarifying that relative contrast consistency should be optimized.

Method: Reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem with closed-form solutions, extending to multiple variables with interpretable eigenvalues.

Result: New approaches recover similar performance to CCS while avoiding sensitivity to random initialization across various datasets.

Conclusion: Relativizing contrast consistency improves CCS understanding and opens pathways for broader probing and interpretability methods.

Abstract: Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) is an unsupervised probing method able to
test whether large language models represent binary features, such as sentence
truth, in their internal activations. While CCS has shown promise, its two-term
objective has been only partially understood. In this work, we revisit CCS with
the aim of clarifying its mechanisms and extending its applicability. We argue
that what should be optimized for, is relative contrast consistency. Building
on this insight, we reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem, yielding closed-form
solutions with interpretable eigenvalues and natural extensions to multiple
variables. We evaluate these approaches across a range of datasets, finding
that they recover similar performance to CCS, while avoiding problems around
sensitivity to random initialization. Our results suggest that relativizing
contrast consistency not only improves our understanding of CCS but also opens
pathways for broader probing and mechanistic interpretability methods.

TL;DR: A unified framework for structured world models using discrete and continuous building blocks, with HMMs and sLDS as core components, supporting both passive modeling and active control while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragmentation in world modeling research by providing standardized building blocks that can be composed hierarchically, similar to how layers enabled progress in deep learning.

Method: Uses Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for discrete processes and switching linear dynamical systems (sLDS) for continuous processes as fundamental building blocks, composed hierarchically with fixed causal architecture and search over only four depth parameters.

Result: Achieves competitive performance to neural approaches in multimodal generative modeling and planning from pixels while maintaining interpretability, avoiding combinatorial explosion through structured parameterization.

Conclusion: The proposed building blocks could provide foundational infrastructure for world modeling if scalable joint structure-parameter learning is solved, analogous to standardized layers in deep learning.

Abstract: The field of world modeling is fragmented, with researchers developing
bespoke architectures that rarely build upon each other. We propose a framework
that specifies the natural building blocks for structured world models based on
the fundamental stochastic processes that any world model must capture:
discrete processes (logic, symbols) and continuous processes (physics,
dynamics); the world model is then defined by the hierarchical composition of
these building blocks. We examine Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and switching
linear dynamical systems (sLDS) as natural building blocks for discrete and
continuous modeling--which become partially-observable Markov decision
processes (POMDPs) and controlled sLDS when augmented with actions. This
modular approach supports both passive modeling (generation, forecasting) and
active control (planning, decision-making) within the same architecture. We
avoid the combinatorial explosion of traditional structure learning by largely
fixing the causal architecture and searching over only four depth parameters.
We review practical expressiveness through multimodal generative modeling
(passive) and planning from pixels (active), with performance competitive to
neural approaches while maintaining interpretability. The core outstanding
challenge is scalable joint structure-parameter learning; current methods
finesse this by cleverly growing structure and parameters incrementally, but
are limited in their scalability. If solved, these natural building blocks
could provide foundational infrastructure for world modeling, analogous to how
standardized layers enabled progress in deep learning.

TL;DR: Online learning with uncertainty-guided ensemble methods improves ML model performance for predicting TF coil deflection in fusion devices, reducing error by 80% compared to static models and further improving over standard online learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fusion data shows non-stationary behavior with distribution drifts due to experimental evolution and machine wear-and-tear, causing ML models to fail when assuming stationary distributions. Online learning techniques are needed to adapt to these drifting data streams.

Method: Applied online learning to adapt to drifting data for TF coil deflection prediction. Proposed uncertainty-guided online ensemble using Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA) for calibrated uncertainty estimation, which guides a meta-algorithm using an ensemble of learners trained on different historical data horizons.

Result: Online learning reduced error by 80% compared to static models. The proposed uncertainty-guided online ensemble further reduced prediction error by about 10% over standard single-model online learning, with DGPA providing uncertainty estimation for decision makers.

Conclusion: Online learning is critical for maintaining ML model performance in fusion applications with non-stationary data, and uncertainty-guided ensemble methods provide additional performance improvements while offering uncertainty quantification for decision support.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is poised to play a pivotal role in the development and
operation of next-generation fusion devices. Fusion data shows non-stationary
behavior with distribution drifts, resulted by both experimental evolution and
machine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to
maintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams.
Online learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has
been largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an
application of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream
for prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion
facility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain
ML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model.
Moreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance
degradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As
such, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further
improve the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA)
technique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the
uncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces
predictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of
historical data. The DGPA also provides uncertainty estimation along with the
predictions for decision makers. The online ensemble and the proposed
uncertainty guided online ensemble reduces predictions error by about 6%, and
10% respectively over standard single model based online learning.

*Rodrigo Mendoza-Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes geometric leverage scores as a computationally efficient alternative to Shapley data valuation, showing they satisfy key axioms and provide theoretical guarantees for model quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley data valuation is computationally infeasible at scale due to its combinatorial nature, requiring evaluation of all data subsets. There's a need for scalable alternatives that maintain theoretical guarantees.

Method: Proposes geometric leverage scores (and ridge leverage scores) that quantify each datapoint's structural influence in representation space by measuring how much it extends the dataset span and contributes to effective dimensionality.

Result: Leverage scores satisfy Shapley's dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms. Ridge leverage scores yield strictly positive marginal gains and connect to classical optimal design criteria. Training on leverage-sampled subsets produces models with parameters and predictive risk within O(ε) of full-data optimum.

Conclusion: Leverage scores provide a computationally efficient alternative to Shapley valuation with rigorous theoretical guarantees, bridging data valuation to downstream decision quality, and empirically outperform standard baselines in active learning without requiring gradients.

Abstract: Shapley data valuation provides a principled, axiomatic framework for
assigning importance to individual datapoints, and has gained traction in
dataset curation, pruning, and pricing. However, it is a combinatorial measure
that requires evaluating marginal utility across all subsets of the data,
making it computationally infeasible at scale. We propose a geometric
alternative based on statistical leverage scores, which quantify each
datapoint's structural influence in the representation space by measuring how
much it extends the span of the dataset and contributes to the effective
dimensionality of the training problem. We show that our scores satisfy the
dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms of Shapley valuation and that extending
them to \emph{ridge leverage scores} yields strictly positive marginal gains
that connect naturally to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria. We
further show that training on a leverage-sampled subset produces a model whose
parameters and predictive risk are within $O(\varepsilon)$ of the full-data
optimum, thereby providing a rigorous link between data valuation and
downstream decision quality. Finally, we conduct an active learning experiment
in which we empirically demonstrate that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms
standard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.

### [138] [Matrix Sensing with Kernel Optimal Loss: Robustness and Optimization Landscape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02122)
*Xinyuan Song,Jiaye Teng,Ziye Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies how robust loss functions affect optimization landscape in non-convex problems like matrix sensing, showing that kernel-based robust losses outperform MSE under non-Gaussian noise while maintaining performance under Gaussian noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mean squared error (MSE) loss is unreliable for non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise in regression tasks, motivating the need for robust alternatives that maintain stability across diverse noise distributions.

Method: Adopts a robust loss based on nonparametric regression using kernel-based residual density estimation to maximize log-likelihood, and analyzes how this loss reshapes optimization landscape through RIP constant analysis.

Result: The robust loss excels at handling large noise and remains stable across diverse noise distributions, coinciding with MSE under Gaussian errors but outperforming it in non-Gaussian settings.

Conclusion: Simply changing the loss function can enhance robustness in machine learning tasks, with the proposed framework offering intuitive and broadly applicable insights for improving optimization landscape in non-convex problems.

Abstract: In this paper we study how the choice of loss functions of non-convex
optimization problems affects their robustness and optimization landscape,
through the study of noisy matrix sensing. In traditional regression tasks,
mean squared error (MSE) loss is a common choice, but it can be unreliable for
non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise. To address this issue, we adopt a robust
loss based on nonparametric regression, which uses a kernel-based estimate of
the residual density and maximizes the estimated log-likelihood. This robust
formulation coincides with the MSE loss under Gaussian errors but remains
stable under more general settings. We further examine how this robust loss
reshapes the optimization landscape by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted
isometry property (RIP) constants for spurious local minima to disappear.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this new loss excels
at handling large noise and remains robust across diverse noise distributions.
This work offers initial insights into enhancing the robustness of machine
learning tasks through simply changing the loss, guided by an intuitive and
broadly applicable analytical framework.

*Xuheng Li,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FGTSVA is a variance-aware Thompson Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with general reward functions that achieves optimal regret bounds, improving upon prior variance-dependent Thompson sampling approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most variance-dependent regret bounds focus on UCB-based algorithms, while Thompson sampling approaches are understudied. The only existing variance-aware Thompson sampling (LinVDTS) is limited to linear rewards and has suboptimal dimension dependence.

Method: FGTSVA extends the decoupling coefficient technique from Feel-good Thompson sampling to handle variance-aware analysis. The algorithm works with general reward functions and achieves optimal regret bounds through this extended decoupling coefficient approach.

Result: FGTSVA achieves regret of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$, where $\mathrm{dc}$ is the new decoupling coefficient, $|\mathcal{F}|$ is model space size, and $\sigma_t^2$ is noise variance. For contextual linear bandits, it matches UCB-based algorithms using weighted linear regression.

Conclusion: FGTSVA provides the first variance-aware Thompson sampling algorithm with optimal regret bounds for general reward functions, bridging the gap between UCB-based and Thompson sampling approaches in variance-dependent contextual bandit analysis.

Abstract: Variance-dependent regret bounds have received increasing attention in recent
studies on contextual bandits. However, most of these studies are focused on
upper confidence bound (UCB)-based bandit algorithms, while sampling based
bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling are still understudied. The only
exception is the LinVDTS algorithm (Xu et al., 2023), which is limited to
linear reward function and its regret bound is not optimal with respect to the
model dimension. In this paper, we present FGTSVA, a variance-aware Thompson
Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with general reward function with
optimal regret bound. At the core of our analysis is an extension of the
decoupling coefficient, a technique commonly used in the analysis of Feel-good
Thompson sampling (FGTS) that reflects the complexity of the model space. With
the new decoupling coefficient denoted by $\mathrm{dc}$, FGTS-VA achieves the
regret of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$,
where $|\mathcal{F}|$ is the size of the model space, $T$ is the total number
of rounds, and $\sigma_t^2$ is the subgaussian norm of the noise (e.g.,
variance when the noise is Gaussian) at round $t$. In the setting of contextual
linear bandits, the regret bound of FGTSVA matches that of UCB-based algorithms
using weighted linear regression (Zhou and Gu, 2022).

Abstract: Early identification of abnormal physiological patterns is essential for the
timely detection of cardiac disease. This work introduces a hybrid
quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCNN) designed to classify S3

one-dimensional phonocardiogram (PCG) signals into compact two-dimensional

8-pixel image so that only 8 qubits are needed for the quantum stage.
Preliminary results on the HLS-CMDS dataset demonstrate 93.33% classification
accuracy on the test set and 97.14% on the train set, suggesting that quantum
models can efficiently capture temporal-spectral correlations in biomedical
signals. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a QCNN algorithm

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing drug synergy prediction methods operate as black-box predictors relying on statistical correlations, lacking interpretability and robustness to redundant features from spurious substructures.

Method: Disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious substructures, uses causal representations for prediction, employs conditional intervention mechanism conditioned on paired molecular structures, and introduces optimization objective guided by sufficiency and independence principles.

Result: Outperforms baseline models, especially in cold start and out-of-distribution settings, and effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug synergy for molecular-level insights.

Conclusion: CausalDDS shows potential as a practical tool for predicting drug synergy and facilitating drug discovery by providing interpretable molecular-level insights.

Abstract: Drug synergy prediction is a critical task in the development of effective
combination therapies for complex diseases, including cancer. Although existing
methods have shown promising results, they often operate as black-box
predictors that rely predominantly on statistical correlations between drug
characteristics and results. To address this limitation, we propose CausalDDS,
a novel framework that disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious
substructures, utilizing the causal substructure representations for predicting
drug synergy. By focusing on causal sub-structures, CausalDDS effectively
mitigates the impact of redundant features introduced by spurious
substructures, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of the model. In
addition, CausalDDS employs a conditional intervention mechanism, where
interventions are conditioned on paired molecular structures, and introduces a
novel optimization objective guided by the principles of sufficiency and
independence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
baseline models, particularly in cold start and out-of-distribution settings.
Besides, CausalDDS effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug
synergy, providing clear insights into how drug combinations work at the
molecular level. These results underscore the potential of CausalDDS as a
practical tool for predicting drug synergy and facilitating drug discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often underperform in real-world deployment due to distribution shift, which can cause catastrophic outcomes in high-risk applications. Traditional statistical methods have limitations in quantifying this shift effectively.

Method: The authors use Characteristic Function (CF) as a frequency domain approach to measure distribution shift, particularly for high-dimensional spaces and domain adaptation tasks.

Result: The paper demonstrates that CF is a powerful alternative to traditional statistical techniques like Kullback-Leibler divergence, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, and Wasserstein distance for quantifying distribution shift.

Conclusion: Characteristic Function provides an effective frequency-domain solution for measuring distribution shift in machine learning models, especially beneficial for high-dimensional spaces and domain adaptation scenarios.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are extensively used in various applications due
to their significant advantages over traditional learning methods. However, the
developed ML models often underperform when deployed in the real world due to
the well-known distribution shift problem. This problem can lead to a
catastrophic outcomes when these decision-making systems have to operate in
high-risk applications. Many researchers have previously studied this problem
in ML, known as distribution shift problem, using statistical techniques (such
as Kullback-Leibler, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, Wasserstein distance, etc.) to
quantify the distribution shift. In this letter, we show that using
Characteristic Function (CF) as a frequency domain approach is a powerful
alternative for measuring the distribution shift in high-dimensional space and
for domain adaptation.

we present ProtoTSNet, a novel approach to interpretable classification of
multivariate time series data, through substantial enhancements to the
ProtoPNet architecture. Our method is tailored to overcome the unique
challenges of time series analysis, including capturing dynamic patterns and

*Yuzhuang Pian,Taiyu Wang,Shiqi Zhang,Rui Xu,Yonghong Liu*

TL;DR: CGLUBNF is an end-to-end framework for air quality forecasting that handles incomplete spatiotemporal data using Bayesian neural networks with graph attention and channel gating mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate air quality forecasts are crucial for public health and emissions control, but observational data often has missing values due to collection and transmission issues, which impedes reliable inference and can lead to overconfident extrapolation.

Method: Proposes CGLUBNF framework using Fourier features with graph attention encoder for spatial dependencies, channel gated learning unit with learnable activations for feature filtering, and Bayesian inference for uncertainty quantification.

Result: Superior prediction accuracy and sharper confidence intervals compared to five state-of-the-art baselines across four typical missing data patterns, with validated robustness across multiple prediction horizons.

Conclusion: The research provides a foundation for reliable deep learning-based spatiotemporal forecasting with incomplete observations, applicable to emerging sensing paradigms like vehicle-borne mobile monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate air quality forecasts are vital for public health alerts, exposure
assessment, and emissions control. In practice, observational data are often
missing in varying proportions and patterns due to collection and transmission
issues. These incomplete spatiotemporal records impede reliable inference and
risk assessment and can lead to overconfident extrapolation. To address these
challenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit
based spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features
with a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and
seasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with
learnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and
amplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive
distributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and
calibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real
world datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing
against five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction
accuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate
robustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of
extraneous variables. This research lays a foundation for reliable deep
learning based spatio-temporal forecasting with incomplete observations in
emerging sensing paradigms, such as real world vehicle borne mobile monitoring.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniField is a framework for multimodal spatiotemporal learning that handles sparse, irregular, noisy data with varying modality availability by learning continuous neural fields conditioned on available modalities and using iterative cross-modal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world experimental data has sparse, irregular, noisy measurements within modalities but cross-modal correlations, and modality availability varies across space and time, requiring models that can adapt to arbitrary modality subsets.

Method: Uses a continuity-aware framework with multimodal crosstalk block architecture and iterative cross-modal refinement to align signals before decoding, enabling unified reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without preprocessing.

Result: OmniField consistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines and maintains performance close to clean-input levels under heavy simulated sensor noise.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robustness to corrupted measurements and effectively handles the challenges of multimodal spatiotemporal learning with varying modality availability.

Abstract: Multimodal spatiotemporal learning on real-world experimental data is
constrained by two challenges: within-modality measurements are sparse,
irregular, and noisy (QA/QC artifacts) but cross-modally correlated; the set of
available modalities varies across space and time, shrinking the usable record
unless models can adapt to arbitrary subsets at train and test time. We propose
OmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field
conditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context.
A multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal
refinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified
reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without
gridding or surrogate preprocessing. Extensive evaluations show that OmniField
consistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines.
Under heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains close to clean-input
levels, highlighting robustness to corrupted measurements.

*Fan Feng,Phillip Lippe,Sara Magliacane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FIOC-WM is a framework that learns structured representations of objects and their interactions in world models, improving sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most object-centric RL methods only factor state by individual objects while leaving interactions implicit, limiting robustness and transferability.

Method: Learns object-centric latents and interaction structure from pixels using pre-trained vision encoders, then decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives with hierarchical policy (high-level selects interaction types/order, low-level executes them).

Result: Improves policy-learning sample efficiency and generalization over world-model baselines on simulated robotic and embodied-AI benchmarks.

Conclusion: Explicit, modular interaction learning is crucial for robust control in object-centric reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Agents that understand objects and their interactions can learn policies that
are more robust and transferable. However, most object-centric RL methods
factor state by individual objects while leaving interactions implicit. We
introduce the Factored Interactive Object-Centric World Model (FIOC-WM), a
unified framework that learns structured representations of both objects and
their interactions within a world model. FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics
with disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, improving
sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. Concretely, FIOC-WM
first learns object-centric latents and an interaction structure directly from
pixels, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders. The learned world model then
decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical
policy is trained on top: a high level selects the type and order of
interactions, while a low level executes them. On simulated robotic and
embodied-AI benchmarks, FIOC-WM improves policy-learning sample efficiency and
generalization over world-model baselines, indicating that explicit, modular
interaction learning is crucial for robust control.

*Costin-Andrei Oncescu,Qingyang Wu,Wai Tong Chung,Robert Wu,Bryan Gopal,Junxiong Wang,Tri Dao,Ben Athiwaratkun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic routing framework for MoE models that reduces decode latency by optimizing token-to-expert mapping while maintaining model quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models suffer from memory-bound regimes during autoregressive generation where latency is governed by the number of activated experts, creating a need for latency optimization.

Method: Batch-aware routing that allows tokens to piggyback experts already loaded in memory from other tokens in the same batch, reducing the number of activated experts.

Result: 39% latency reduction for Qwen3-30B and 15% for Qwen3-235B with batch size 16, without statistically significant accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Dynamic routing effectively reduces MoE decode latency while preserving model quality, making it a practical optimization for MoE architectures.

Abstract: An increasing number of LLMs employ Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
where the feed-forward layer is replaced by a pool of experts and each token
only activates a small subset of them. During autoregressive generation, these
models often enter a memory-bound regime even for moderate batch sizes because
the average expert load grows more slowly than in an equivalent dense
feedforward layer. Consequently, MoE latency is governed by the number of
activated experts. We introduce a framework for dynamically re-routing
token-to-expert mapping to lower this number (and thus, the decode latency)
while preserving a comparable quality. Our best results use a batch-aware
routing that works by having tokens piggyback experts that have already been
loaded into memory due to being crucial to other tokens within the same batch.
Empirically, we evaluate our method on the Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-235B models with
a batch size of $16$. Without any statistically significant loss in accuracy,
our approach achieves latency reductions of $39\%$ and $15\%$ in the MoE layer
decode latency, respectively.

TL;DR: Proposes a spectral bias-aware initialization framework that adjusts SWIM algorithm scale factors to capture low-frequency components in early layers and high-frequency components in late layers, improving training performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network initialization significantly impacts learning performance, and spectral bias (learning coarse information in earlier layers) is a known phenomenon. The goal is to leverage spectral bias information to improve initialization strategies.

Method: A framework that modifies the SWIM algorithm by adjusting scale factors to specifically capture low-frequency components in early hidden layers and high-frequency components in late hidden layers, aligning with the spectral bias property.

Result: Numerical experiments on 1D regression and MNIST classification tasks show the proposed method outperforms conventional initialization algorithms.

Conclusion: The work clarifies the importance of intrinsic spectral properties in neural network learning and provides an effective parameter initialization strategy that enhances training performance by aligning with spectral bias characteristics.

Abstract: Initialization of neural network parameters, such as weights and biases, has
a crucial impact on learning performance; if chosen well, we can even avoid the
need for additional training with backpropagation. For example, algorithms
based on the ridgelet transform or the SWIM (sampling where it matters) concept
have been proposed for initialization. On the other hand, it is well-known that
neural networks tend to learn coarse information in the earlier layers. The
feature is called spectral bias. In this work, we investigate the effects of
utilizing information on the spectral bias in the initialization of neural
networks. Hence, we propose a framework that adjusts the scale factors in the
SWIM algorithm to capture low-frequency components in the early-stage hidden
layers and to represent high-frequency components in the late-stage hidden
layers. Numerical experiments on a one-dimensional regression task and the
MNIST classification task demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
conventional initialization algorithms. This work clarifies the importance of
intrinsic spectral properties in learning neural networks, and the finding
yields an effective parameter initialization strategy that enhances their
training performance.

TL;DR: This paper connects gradient-variation online learning with offline optimization, developing adaptive algorithms for Hölder smooth functions that work across smooth and non-smooth regimes without prior knowledge of smoothness parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between accelerated offline optimization and gradient-variation online learning, and to develop universal methods that work optimally across both smooth and non-smooth function regimes without requiring prior knowledge of smoothness parameters.

Method: Design gradient-variation online learning algorithms for (strongly) convex Hölder smooth functions, then use online-to-batch conversion for stochastic optimization. For offline strongly convex optimization, combine online adaptivity with a detection-based guess-and-check procedure.

Result: Developed adaptive online algorithms that interpolate between optimal guarantees in smooth and non-smooth regimes. Achieved universal stochastic convex optimization method. For offline strongly convex optimization, created first universal method with accelerated convergence in smooth regime and near-optimal in non-smooth regime.

Conclusion: The paper successfully connects online and offline optimization through gradient-variation analysis, providing adaptive algorithms that achieve optimal performance across smoothness regimes without requiring prior knowledge of smoothness parameters, with particular success in developing the first universal offline method for strongly convex optimization.

Abstract: Smoothness is known to be crucial for acceleration in offline optimization,
and for gradient-variation regret minimization in online learning.
Interestingly, these two problems are actually closely connected -- accelerated
optimization can be understood through the lens of gradient-variation online
learning. In this paper, we investigate online learning with H\"older smooth
functions, a general class encompassing both smooth and non-smooth (Lipschitz)
functions, and explore its implications for offline optimization. For
(strongly) convex online functions, we design the corresponding
gradient-variation online learning algorithm whose regret smoothly interpolates
between the optimal guarantees in smooth and non-smooth regimes. Notably, our
algorithms do not require prior knowledge of the H\"older smoothness parameter,
exhibiting strong adaptivity over existing methods. Through online-to-batch
conversion, this gradient-variation online adaptivity yields an optimal
universal method for stochastic convex optimization under H\"older smoothness.
However, achieving universality in offline strongly convex optimization is more
challenging. We address this by integrating online adaptivity with a
detection-based guess-and-check procedure, which, for the first time, yields a
universal offline method that achieves accelerated convergence in the smooth
regime while maintaining near-optimal convergence in the non-smooth one.

TL;DR: A novel method combining reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian filtering to learn state transition models directly from noisy observations without requiring true state trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data assimilation is challenging when governing equations are unknown, and existing machine learning approaches require noise-free ground-truth state sequences which are often infeasible to obtain in practice.

Method: Formulate maximum likelihood estimation of surrogate model parameters as a sequential decision-making problem using Markov decision processes, then solve it with reinforcement learning techniques to learn state transition models offline.

Result: The method achieves superior accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional settings, accommodating nonlinear and partially observed measurement models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables effective state estimation for unknown dynamics directly from noisy observations without requiring true state trajectories.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) has increasingly emerged as a critical tool for state
estimation
  across a wide range of applications. It is signiffcantly challenging when the
governing equations of the underlying dynamics are unknown. To this end,
various machine learning approaches have been employed to construct a surrogate
state transition
  model in a supervised learning framework, which relies on pre-computed
training
  datasets. However, it is often infeasible to obtain noise-free ground-truth
state sequences in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
method that integrates reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian
ffltering methods, enabling
  the learning of surrogate state transition model for unknown dynamics
directly from noisy observations, without using true state trajectories.
Speciffcally, we treat the process for computing maximum likelihood estimation
of surrogate model parameters
  as a sequential decision-making problem, which can be formulated as a
discretetime
  Markov decision process (MDP). Under this formulation, learning the surrogate
transition model is equivalent to ffnding an optimal policy of the MDP, which
can be effectively addressed using reinforcement learning techniques. Once the
model is trained offfine, state estimation can be performed in the online stage
using ffltering methods based on the learned dynamics. The proposed framework
accommodates a wide range of observation scenarios, including nonlinear and
partially observed measurement
  models. A few numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in IIoT anomaly detection including privacy concerns, scalability issues, communication efficiency, and handling highly non-linear decision boundaries with imbalanced anomaly distributions.

Method: Quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using parameterized quantum circuits, share summaries with central server which constructs global Gram matrix and trains decision function (Fed-QSVM).

Result: FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal correlations compared to classical federated baselines while significantly reducing communication overhead.

Conclusion: Demonstrates promise of quantum kernels in federated settings for scalable, robust, quantum-enhanced intelligence in next-generation IoT infrastructures.

Abstract: The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created
new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate
time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are
critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by
enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear
decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap,
we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates
quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed,
privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our
design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using
parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central
server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function
(e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate
that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal
correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly
reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum
kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and
quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FP8-Flow-MoE enables efficient FP8 training for large Mixture-of-Experts models by eliminating redundant cast operations through quantization-consistent dataflow and fused operators, achieving significant speedup and memory savings while maintaining convergence stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large MoE models is computationally prohibitive due to extreme compute and memory demands. Existing FP8 implementations suffer from frequent quantize-dequantize conversions that erode efficiency, while naive FP8-only approaches cause numerical instability from double quantization errors.

Method: Proposes FP8-Flow-MoE with quantization-consistent FP8-centric dataflow, scaling-aware transpose, and fused FP8 operators that reduce explicit cast operations from 12 to 2, eliminating redundant conversions while maintaining numerical stability.

Result: Evaluation on 671B-parameter MoE model shows 21% higher throughput and 16.5 GB lower memory usage per GPU compared to BF16 and naive FP8 baselines, while maintaining stable convergence.

Conclusion: FP8-Flow-MoE provides an effective FP8 training recipe for large MoE models that delivers substantial performance gains and memory savings, with plug-and-play compatibility for TransformerEngine and Megatron-LM frameworks.

Abstract: Training large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models remains computationally
prohibitive due to their extreme compute and memory demands. Although
low-precision training promises to accelerate computation and reduce memory
footprint, existing implementations still rely on BF16-dominated dataflows with
frequent quantize-dequantize (Q/DQ) conversions. These redundant casts erode
much of FP8's theoretical efficiency. However, naively removing these casts by
keeping dataflows entirely in FP8 introduces double quantization error: tensors
quantized along different dimensions accumulate inconsistent scaling factors,
degrading numerical stability.
  We propose FP8-Flow-MoE, an FP8 training recipe featuring a
quantization-consistent FP8-centric dataflow with a scaling-aware transpose and
fused FP8 operators that streamline computation and eliminate explicit cast
operations from 12 to 2. Evaluations on a 671B-parameter MoE model demonstrate
up to 21\% higher throughput and 16.5 GB lower memory usage per GPU compared to
BF16 and na\"ive FP8 baselines, while maintaining stable convergence. We
provide a plug-and-play FP8 recipe compatible with TransformerEngine and
Megatron-LM, which will be open-sourced soon.

### [154] [The Sequential Edge: Inverse-Entropy Voting Beats Parallel Self-Consistency at Matched Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02309)
*Aman Sharma,Paras Chopra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sequential scaling outperforms parallel self-consistency for language model reasoning at equal token/compute budget, with a novel inverse-entropy voting method further boosting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the optimal test-time scaling strategy for language model reasoning - whether multiple parallel chains or fewer sequential refinement chains perform better under equal token and compute constraints.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation across 5 state-of-the-art open source models and 3 reasoning benchmarks, comparing parallel self-consistency vs sequential refinement chains. Introduced inverse-entropy weighted voting to weigh answers based on reasoning chain entropy.

Result: Sequential scaling outperformed parallel self-consistency in 95.6% of configurations with accuracy gains up to 46.7%. Inverse-entropy voting further improved success rates over parallel majority voting.

Conclusion: Sequential refinement should replace parallel reasoning as the default test-time scaling strategy, challenging the dominant self-consistency paradigm and necessitating a paradigm shift in inference-time optimization.

Abstract: We revisit test-time scaling for language model reasoning and ask a
fundamental question: at equal token budget and compute, is it better to run
multiple independent chains in parallel, or to run fewer chains that
iteratively refine through sequential steps? Through comprehensive evaluation
across 5 state-of-the-art open source models and 3 challenging reasoning
benchmarks, we find that sequential scaling where chains explicitly build upon
previous attempts consistently outperforms the dominant parallel
self-consistency paradigm in 95.6% of configurations with gains in accuracy
upto 46.7%. Further, we introduce inverse-entropy weighted voting, a novel
training-free method to further boost the accuracy of sequential scaling. By
weighing answers in proportion to the inverse entropy of their reasoning
chains, we increase our success rate over parallel majority and establish it as
the optimal test-time scaling strategy. Our findings fundamentally challenge
the parallel reasoning orthodoxy that has dominated test-time scaling since
Wang et al.'s self-consistency decoding (Wang et al., 2022), positioning
sequential refinement as the robust default for modern LLM reasoning and
necessitating a paradigm shift in how we approach inference-time optimization.

### [155] [Large-scale automatic carbon ion treatment planning for head and neck cancers via parallel multi-agent reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02314)
*Jueye Zhang,Chao Yang,Youfang Lai,Kai-Wen Li,Wenting Yan,Yunzhou Xia,Haimei Zhang,Jingjing Zhou,Gen Yang,Chen Lin,Tian Li,Yibao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for automatically tuning 45 treatment-planning parameters in intensity-modulated carbon-ion therapy for head-and-neck cancer, achieving comparable or better plan quality than expert manual tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intensity-modulated carbon-ion therapy planning is slow and laborious due to complex relative biological effectiveness modeling and the need for manual tuning of many parameters, while existing deep learning methods face data bias and feasibility issues.

Method: Scalable multi-agent RL framework using centralized-training decentralized-execution QMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding, featuring compact DVH state inputs, linear action-to-value transform, and clinically informed piecewise rewards.

Result: The method tuned 45 parameters simultaneously and produced plans comparable to or better than expert manual ones (RL 85.93±7.85% vs Manual 85.02±6.92%), with significant improvements for five organs-at-risk.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently explores high-dimensional parameter spaces and generates clinically competitive carbon-ion therapy plans through direct treatment planning system interaction, notably improving organ-at-risk sparing.

Abstract: Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) planning is difficult because multiple critical
organs-at-risk (OARs) are close to complex targets. Intensity-modulated
carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) offers superior dose conformity and OAR sparing but
remains slow due to relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, leading
to laborious, experience-based, and often suboptimal tuning of many
treatment-planning parameters (TPPs). Recent deep learning (DL) methods are
limited by data bias and plan feasibility, while reinforcement learning (RL)
struggles to efficiently explore the exponentially large TPP search space. We
propose a scalable multi-agent RL (MARL) framework for parallel tuning of 45
TPPs in IMCT. It uses a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE)
QMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding (DRQN) for
stable learning in a high-dimensional, non-stationary environment. To enhance
efficiency, we (1) use compact historical DVH vectors as state inputs, (2)
apply a linear action-to-value transform mapping small discrete actions to
uniform parameter adjustments, and (3) design an absolute, clinically informed
piecewise reward aligned with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker
system interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and
accelerated data collection. On a head-and-neck dataset (10 training, 10
testing), the method tuned 45 parameters simultaneously and produced plans
comparable to or better than expert manual ones (relative plan score: RL
$85.93\pm7.85%$ vs Manual $85.02\pm6.92%$), with significant (p-value $<$ 0.05)
improvements for five OARs. The framework efficiently explores high-dimensional
TPP spaces and generates clinically competitive IMCT plans through direct TPS
interaction, notably improving OAR sparing.

*Tianle Pu,Zijie Geng,Haoyang Liu,Shixuan Liu,Jie Wang,Li Zeng,Chao Chen,Changjun Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RoME is a domain-robust mixture-of-experts framework that uses distributionally robust optimization to improve MILP solver generalization across domains, achieving 67.7% average improvement on unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based MILP solvers are limited to single-domain settings and struggle to generalize to unseen problem distributions, hindering the development of scalable general-purpose solvers.

Method: RoME uses a mixture-of-experts framework that dynamically routes problem instances to specialized experts based on learned task embeddings, trained with two-level distributionally robust optimization (inter-domain and intra-domain).

Result: A single RoME model trained on three domains achieves 67.7% average improvement when evaluated on five diverse domains, and shows measurable performance gains on MIPLIB in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: Cross-domain training enhances both generalization to unseen domains and performance within individual domains by capturing more general intrinsic combinatorial patterns, enabling robust learning-based MILP solvers.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental and powerful
framework for modeling complex optimization problems across diverse domains.
Recently, learning-based methods have shown great promise in accelerating MILP
solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, most existing approaches
are developed and evaluated in single-domain settings, limiting their ability
to generalize to unseen problem distributions. This limitation poses a major
obstacle to building scalable and general-purpose learning-based solvers. To
address this challenge, we introduce RoME, a domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts
framework for predicting MILP solutions across domains. RoME dynamically routes
problem instances to specialized experts based on learned task embeddings. The
model is trained using a two-level distributionally robust optimization
strategy: inter-domain to mitigate global shifts across domains, and
intra-domain to enhance local robustness by introducing perturbations on task
embeddings. We reveal that cross-domain training not only enhances the model's
generalization capability to unseen domains but also improves performance
within each individual domain by encouraging the model to capture more general
intrinsic combinatorial patterns. Specifically, a single RoME model trained on
three domains achieves an average improvement of 67.7% then evaluated on five
diverse domains. We further test the pretrained model on MIPLIB in a zero-shot
setting, demonstrating its ability to deliver measurable performance gains on
challenging real-world instances where existing learning-based approaches often
struggle to generalize.

*Fidan Karimova,Tong Chen,Yu Yang,Shazia Sadiq*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HYSTL is a hypernetwork-enhanced framework for crime prediction that handles diverse crime types across cities by dynamically generating prediction parameters through a crime knowledge graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crime prediction methods struggle with aligning knowledge across cities that have different crime type data availability, making unified prediction challenging.

Method: Uses a hypernetwork to dynamically generate prediction parameters conditioned on crime types, with a structured crime knowledge graph to bridge semantic gaps between different crime types.

Result: Extensive experiments on two cities with non-overlapping crime types show HYSTL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: HYSTL effectively trains unified crime predictors across diverse cities without requiring identical crime type records, leveraging crime associations for improved prediction.

Abstract: Predicting crimes in urban environments is crucial for public safety, yet
existing prediction methods often struggle to align the knowledge across
diverse cities that vary dramatically in data availability of specific crime
types. We propose HYpernetwork-enhanced Spatial Temporal Learning (HYSTL), a
framework that can effectively train a unified, stronger crime predictor
without assuming identical crime types in different cities' records. In HYSTL,
instead of parameterising a dedicated predictor per crime type, a hypernetwork
is designed to dynamically generate parameters for the prediction function
conditioned on the crime type of interest. To bridge the semantic gap between
different crime types, a structured crime knowledge graph is built, where the
learned representations of crimes are used as the input to the hypernetwork to
facilitate parameter generation. As such, when making predictions for each
crime type, the predictor is additionally guided by its intricate association
with other relevant crime types. Extensive experiments are performed on two
cities with non-overlapping crime types, and the results demonstrate HYSTL
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

### [158] [Reducing normalizing flow complexity for MCMC preconditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02345)
*David Nabergoj,Erik Štrumbelj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a factorized preconditioning architecture combining linear preconditioning for Gaussian dimensions with conditional normalizing flows for complex dimensions, improving MCMC sampling efficiency on geometrically challenging distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing nonlinear preconditioners using normalizing flows can degrade sampling efficiency when overparameterized and don't adapt to target distribution geometry. Linear preconditioners work well for moderately complex distributions but struggle with highly complex geometries.

Method: Factorized architecture that applies linear preconditioning to approximately Gaussian dimensions (estimated from warmup samples) and uses conditional normalizing flows for more complex dimensions, reducing overall NF complexity.

Result: Significantly better tail samples on complex synthetic distributions, consistently better performance on sparse logistic regression posteriors, and higher effective sample sizes on hierarchical Bayesian models with weak likelihoods and strong funnel geometries.

Conclusion: The factorized preconditioning approach improves adaptability to target geometry and sampling efficiency, particularly relevant for hierarchical Bayesian models with limited data, and could inform neural MCMC design.

Abstract: Preconditioning is a key component of MCMC algorithms that improves sampling
efficiency by facilitating exploration of geometrically complex target
distributions through an invertible map. While linear preconditioners are often
sufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has
explored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as
components of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical
studies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling
efficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt
their architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC
similarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or
superior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose
a factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by
combining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to
target geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are
approximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional
NF models more complex dimensions. Our method yields significantly better tail
samples on two complex synthetic distributions and consistently better
performance on a sparse logistic regression posterior across varying likelihood
and prior strengths. It also achieves higher effective sample sizes on
hierarchical Bayesian model posteriors with weak likelihoods and strong funnel
geometries. This approach is particularly relevant for hierarchical Bayesian
model analyses with limited data and could inform current theoretical and
software strides in neural MCMC design.

dancer-specific movement to sound through somatic memory and association, we
propose an alternative approach to human-machine collaboration, one that
preserves the expressive depth of the performing body while leveraging machine
learning for attentive observation and responsiveness. We demonstrate that this
human-centered design reliably supports high accuracy classification (<50 ms
latency), offering a replicable framework to integrate dance-literate machines
into creative, educational, and live performance contexts.

TL;DR: EvoOOD is a novel framework for out-of-distribution generalization on dynamic graphs using environment-aware invariant pattern recognition to address distribution shifts in non-stationary environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs exhibit poor generalization under distribution shifts in dynamic graph scenarios, which is inevitable as graphs evolve in non-stationary environments. There's a need to explore how evolving latent environments affect OOD generalization.

Method: Uses environment sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer underlying distributions. Implements environment-aware invariant pattern recognition and fine-grained causal interventions on nodes using instantiated environment samples to distinguish spatio-temporal invariant patterns.

Result: Experimental results show superiority on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: This is the first attempt to study dynamic graph OOD generalization from the environment evolution perspective, successfully addressing distribution shifts through environment-aware invariant pattern recognition.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in exploiting the spatial
and temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing GNNs exhibit poor
generalization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in
dynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent
non-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving
Graph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware
invariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment
sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer
the underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for
environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address
environmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we
conduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture
of instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish
spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in
non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority
of EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution
shifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the
dynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution
perspective.

TL;DR: LUMA-RAG is a lifelong multimodal agent architecture that addresses challenges in maintaining index freshness and cross-modal consistency for retrieval-augmented generation systems handling continuous multimodal streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI agents shift from static knowledge bases to continuous multimodal streams (text, images, video, audio), there are challenges in maintaining index freshness without high re-indexing costs and preserving cross-modal semantic consistency across different embedding spaces.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) streaming multi-tier memory system with dynamic embedding spilling from HNSW to compressed IVFPQ tiers under memory constraints; (2) streaming CLAP->CLIP alignment bridge using incremental orthogonal Procrustes updates; (3) stability-aware retrieval telemetry providing Safe@k guarantees by bounding alignment drift and quantization error.

Result: Experiments show robust text-to-image retrieval (Recall@10 = 0.94), graceful performance degradation under product quantization offloading, and provably stable audio-to-image rankings (Safe@1 = 1.0).

Conclusion: LUMA-RAG establishes itself as a practical framework for production multimodal RAG systems, effectively handling continuous multimodal streams while maintaining performance and consistency.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for
grounding large language model outputs in verifiable evidence. However, as
modern AI agents transition from static knowledge bases to continuous
multimodal streams encompassing text, images, video, and audio, two critical
challenges arise: maintaining index freshness without prohibitive re-indexing
costs, and preserving cross-modal semantic consistency across heterogeneous
embedding spaces. We present LUMA-RAG, a lifelong multimodal agent architecture
featuring three key innovations: (i) a streaming, multi-tier memory system that
dynamically spills embeddings from a hot HNSW tier to a compressed IVFPQ tier
under strict memory budgets; (ii) a streaming CLAP->CLIP alignment bridge that
maintains cross-modal consistency through incremental orthogonal Procrustes
updates; and (iii) stability-aware retrieval telemetry providing Safe@k
guarantees by jointly bounding alignment drift and quantization error.
Experiments demonstrate robust text-to-image retrieval (Recall@10 = 0.94),
graceful performance degradation under product quantization offloading, and
provably stable audio-to-image rankings (Safe@1 = 1.0), establishing LUMA-RAG
as a practical framework for production multimodal RAG systems.

TL;DR: A novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM architecture is proposed for heart arrhythmia detection from heart sound recordings, achieving 99.42% accuracy and 98.85% F1 score on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of heart arrhythmia can prevent severe complications, but manual diagnosis is subjective and current deep learning models struggle with generalization in real-world scenarios with small or noisy datasets.

Method: Proposed a CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM architecture that incorporates trainable parameters inspired by the H-Infinity filter from control theory to enhance robustness and generalization in arrhythmia detection from heart sound recordings.

Result: The model achieved stable convergence and outperformed existing benchmarks with 99.42% test accuracy and 98.85% F1 score on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset.

Conclusion: The CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM architecture successfully addresses generalization challenges in arrhythmia detection, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Early detection of heart arrhythmia can prevent severe future complications
in cardiac patients. While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical
standard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently
subjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to
automate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and
efficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network
architectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal
patterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current
models often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially
when dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in
biomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM
architecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound
recordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the
H-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization.
Extensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a
public benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed
model achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a
test accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A decentralized coverage control algorithm for unknown environments using Gaussian Processes, combining exploration and exploitation with local cost minimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous agents to efficiently cover unknown spatial environments in a fully decentralized manner without global information.

Method: Each agent minimizes a local cost function inspired by GP-UCB, combining expected locational cost with variance-based exploration, using greedy inducing point selection for scalable online GP updates.

Result: The algorithm effectively guides agents toward high-density and uncertain regions, demonstrating successful performance in simulation.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized approach enables scalable coverage control in unknown environments using local observations and neighbor communication only.

Abstract: We present a novel decentralized algorithm for coverage control in unknown
spatial environments modeled by Gaussian Processes (GPs). To trade-off between
exploration and exploitation, each agent autonomously determines its trajectory
by minimizing a local cost function. Inspired by the GP-UCB (Upper Confidence
Bound for GPs) acquisition function, the proposed cost combines the expected
locational cost with a variance-based exploration term, guiding agents toward
regions that are both high in predicted density and model uncertainty. Compared
to previous work, our algorithm operates in a fully decentralized fashion,
relying only on local observations and communication with neighboring agents.
In particular, agents periodically update their inducing points using a greedy
selection strategy, enabling scalable online GP updates. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in simulation.

TL;DR: The paper formulates machine unlearning as a constrained optimization problem and introduces feasible updates based on parameter masking to enable effective unlearning while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the machine unlearning problem by developing a unified framework that can work with existing first-order methods while ensuring model utility is not degraded during the unlearning process.

Method: Proposes feasible updates using parameter masking - carefully selecting which parameters to update. Accounts for gradient estimation noise and provides statistical guarantees for locally feasible updates. Designed as a plug-in add-on for first-order unlearning methods.

Result: Experiments with computer vision classifiers validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The technique provides a practical solution for machine unlearning that can be integrated with existing methods while maintaining model performance through careful parameter selection and statistical guarantees.

Abstract: We formulate the machine unlearning problem as a general constrained
optimization problem. It unifies the first-order methods from the approximate
machine unlearning literature. This paper then introduces the concept of
feasible updates as the model's parameter update directions that help with
unlearning while not degrading the utility of the initial model. Our design of
feasible updates is based on masking, \ie\ a careful selection of the model's
parameters worth updating. It also takes into account the estimation noise of
the gradients when processing each batch of data to offer a statistical
guarantee to derive locally feasible updates. The technique can be plugged in,
as an add-on, to any first-order approximate unlearning methods. Experiments
with computer vision classifiers validate this approach.

TL;DR: SKGE proposes spherical knowledge graph embedding by constraining entities to a hypersphere, outperforming Euclidean models like TransE through geometric regularization and inherent hard negative sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Euclidean KGE models have inherent limitations in modeling complex relations and inefficient training due to unbounded space, motivating the exploration of compact manifolds like hyperspheres.

Method: SKGE uses a learnable Spherization Layer to map entities onto a hypersphere and interprets relations as hybrid translate-then-project transformations on the spherical manifold.

Result: SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms TransE on FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M benchmarks, with particularly strong gains on large-scale datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of spherical geometric priors.

Conclusion: The choice of manifold is a fundamental design principle, not just an implementation detail, and geometric priors should be a cornerstone for designing next-generation KGE models.

Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for
representation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as
TransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent
limitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training.
In this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model
that challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a
compact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear
Spherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as
a hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate
that SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean
counterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237
and CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We
provide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing
that this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to
comprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally,
we prove that the spherical geometry creates an "inherently hard negative
sampling" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the
model to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our
findings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an
implementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for
geometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful
and stable KGE models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity PDE simulations are computationally expensive for many-query tasks, and pure data-driven surrogates are often unreliable outside their training distribution.

Method: Hybrid approach that combines neural operators with classical iterative solvers (Krylov methods like conjugate gradient and GMRES) by using learned operators to generate initial guesses.

Result: Reduces iteration counts and end-to-end runtime by up to 90%, while maintaining stability and convergence guarantees of traditional numerical algorithms.

Conclusion: NOWS provides a practical and trustworthy approach to accelerate high-fidelity PDE simulations by combining neural operator speed with traditional solver rigor.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin quantitative descriptions
across the physical sciences and engineering, yet high-fidelity simulation
remains a major computational bottleneck for many-query, real-time, and design
tasks. Data-driven surrogates can be strikingly fast but are often unreliable
when applied outside their training distribution. Here we introduce Neural
Operator Warm Starts (NOWS), a hybrid strategy that harnesses learned solution
operators to accelerate classical iterative solvers by producing high-quality
initial guesses for Krylov methods such as conjugate gradient and GMRES. NOWS
leaves existing discretizations and solver infrastructures intact, integrating
seamlessly with finite-difference, finite-element, isogeometric analysis,
finite volume method, etc. Across our benchmarks, the learned initialization
consistently reduces iteration counts and end-to-end runtime, resulting in a
reduction of the computational time of up to 90 %, while preserving the
stability and convergence guarantees of the underlying numerical algorithms. By
combining the rapid inference of neural operators with the rigor of traditional
solvers, NOWS provides a practical and trustworthy approach to accelerate
high-fidelity PDE simulations.

Method: Dual-module architecture: 1) Cognitive diagnostic module using LLMs fine-tuned on cognitive/neuroimaging data (MMSE, CDR scores, brain volumes), 2) Case retrieval module that encodes patient profiles and retrieves similar cases from knowledge base, with case fusion layer for enhanced contextual understanding.

Result: Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate effectiveness in classifying disease severity and identifying early signs of cognitive decline.

Conclusion: BRAINS shows strong potential as a scalable, explainable assistive tool for early-stage Alzheimer's detection and offers promise for future applications in the field.

Abstract: As the global burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to grow, early and
accurate detection has become increasingly critical, especially in regions with
limited access to advanced diagnostic tools. We propose BRAINS (Biomedical
Retrieval-Augmented Intelligence for Neurodegeneration Screening) to address
this challenge. This novel system harnesses the powerful reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Alzheimer's detection and monitoring.
BRAINS features a dual-module architecture: a cognitive diagnostic module and a
case-retrieval module. The Diagnostic Module utilizes LLMs fine-tuned on
cognitive and neuroimaging datasets -- including MMSE, CDR scores, and brain
volume metrics -- to perform structured assessments of Alzheimer's risk.
Meanwhile, the Case Retrieval Module encodes patient profiles into latent
representations and retrieves similar cases from a curated knowledge base.
These auxiliary cases are fused with the input profile via a Case Fusion Layer
to enhance contextual understanding. The combined representation is then
processed with clinical prompts for inference. Evaluations on real-world
datasets demonstrate BRAINS effectiveness in classifying disease severity and
identifying early signs of cognitive decline. This system not only shows strong
potential as an assistive tool for scalable, explainable, and early-stage
Alzheimer's disease detection, but also offers hope for future applications in
the field.

### [168] [Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck: Learning the Shape of Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02496)
*Ronald Katende*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes V-GIB, a framework that formalizes learning as balancing informativeness with geometric simplicity through curvature and intrinsic dimensionality regularization, showing improved generalization and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create representations that are both informative and geometrically simple (smooth, low-dimensional manifolds) for better generalization, interpretability, and data efficiency in learning systems.

Method: Introduces Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck (V-GIB) which combines mutual information compression with curvature regularization using tractable geometric proxies like Hutchinson trace, Jacobian norms, and local PCA.

Result: Experiments show robust information-geometry Pareto frontiers, stable estimators, and substantial gains in interpretive efficiency. Curvature-aware encoders maintain predictive power under data scarcity, validating the efficiency-curvature law.

Conclusion: V-GIB provides a principled framework for creating geometrically coherent, data-efficient representations aligned with human-understandable structure through measurable geometric regularization.

Abstract: We propose a unified information-geometric framework that formalizes
understanding in learning as a trade-off between informativeness and geometric
simplicity. An encoder phi is evaluated by U(phi) = I(phi(X); Y) - beta *
C(phi), where C(phi) penalizes curvature and intrinsic dimensionality,
enforcing smooth, low-complexity manifolds. Under mild manifold and regularity
assumptions, we derive non-asymptotic bounds showing that generalization error
scales with intrinsic dimension while curvature controls approximation
stability, directly linking geometry to sample efficiency. To operationalize
this theory, we introduce the Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck
(V-GIB), a variational estimator that unifies mutual-information compression
and curvature regularization through tractable geometric proxies such as the
Hutchinson trace, Jacobian norms, and local PCA. Experiments across synthetic
manifolds, few-shot settings, and real-world datasets (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10)
reveal a robust information-geometry Pareto frontier, stable estimators, and
substantial gains in interpretive efficiency. Fractional-data experiments on
CIFAR-10 confirm that curvature-aware encoders maintain predictive power under
data scarcity, validating the predicted efficiency-curvature law. Overall,
V-GIB provides a principled and measurable route to representations that are
geometrically coherent, data-efficient, and aligned with human-understandable
structure.

*Changhao Miao,Yuntian Zhang,Tongyu Wu,Fang Deng,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DRL with heterogeneous query (DRLHQ) as the first end-to-end learning approach for capacitated location-routing problems (CLRPs) and open CLRPs (OCLRPs), using encoder-decoder structure and novel attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLRPs are challenging combinatorial optimization problems with complex constraints and decision interdependencies. While deep reinforcement learning has been applied to vehicle routing problems, research on CLRPs remains underexplored.

Method: Reformulates CLRPs as Markov decision process, uses encoder-decoder structure with novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism to handle interdependency between location and routing decisions, dynamically adapting to various decision-making stages.

Result: Experimental results on synthetic and benchmark datasets show superior solution quality and better generalization performance over traditional and DRL-based baselines for both CLRP and OCLRP.

Conclusion: The proposed DRLHQ approach effectively solves CLRPs and OCLRPs with end-to-end learning, demonstrating strong performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The capacitated location-routing problems (CLRPs) are classical problems in
combinatorial optimization, which require simultaneously making location and
routing decisions. In CLRPs, the complex constraints and the intricate
relationships between various decisions make the problem challenging to solve.
With the emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), it has been
extensively applied to address the vehicle routing problem and its variants,
while the research related to CLRPs still needs to be explored. In this paper,
we propose the DRL with heterogeneous query (DRLHQ) to solve CLRP and open CLRP
(OCLRP), respectively. We are the first to propose an end-to-end learning
approach for CLRPs, following the encoder-decoder structure. In particular, we
reformulate the CLRPs as a markov decision process tailored to various
decisions, a general modeling framework that can be adapted to other DRL-based
methods. To better handle the interdependency across location and routing
decisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism
designed to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages. Experimental
results on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate superior solution
quality and better generalization performance of our proposed approach over
representative traditional and DRL-based baselines in solving both CLRP and
OCLRP.

*Munib Mesinovic,Max Buhlan,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Causal graph neural networks address healthcare AI failures by learning invariant causal mechanisms instead of spurious correlations, enabling more robust and fair clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare AI systems fail across institutions due to learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms, leading to performance drops and discrimination perpetuation.

Method: Combines graph-based biomedical data representations with causal inference principles, including structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and counterfactual reasoning on graphs.

Result: Demonstrates clinical value in psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis, cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, physiological monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting prescription bias.

Conclusion: Establishes foundations for patient-specific Causal Digital Twins but faces barriers including computational requirements, validation challenges, and risks of causal-washing; proposes tiered frameworks to distinguish causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries.

Abstract: Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed
across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of
discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in
part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms.
Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift,
discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of
biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms
rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological
foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal
representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and
counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating
clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis,
cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological
monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting
prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific
Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with
integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph
neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain,
including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment,
validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond
cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal
terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks
distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated
discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than
purely associational claims.

*Hortence Nana,Andreas Athanasopoulos,Christos Dimitrakakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses many-to-one matching problems with non-linear utility functions for diversity, showing classical stable matchings may not exist and proposing Rawlsian fairness-based alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical stable matching models fail when colleges evaluate student sets through non-linear utility functions that capture diversity, requiring new solution concepts.

Method: Proposed deterministic and stochastic algorithms that iteratively improve the outcome of the worst-off college based on Rawlsian fairness principles.

Result: Developed practical approaches for fair allocation when classical stability cannot be guaranteed in diversity-aware matching problems.

Conclusion: Rawlsian fairness provides viable alternative solution concepts for many-to-one matching with diversity considerations when traditional stability is unattainable.

Abstract: We study a many-to-one matching problem, such as the college admission
problem, where each college can admit multiple students. Unlike classical
models, colleges evaluate sets of students through non-linear utility functions
that capture diversity between them. In this setting, we show that classical
stable matchings may fail to exist. To address this, we propose alternative
solution concepts based on Rawlsian fairness, aiming to maximize the minimum
utility across colleges. We design both deterministic and stochastic algorithms
that iteratively improve the outcome of the worst-off college, offering a
practical approach to fair allocation when stability cannot be guaranteed.

### [172] [Theoretical Guarantees for Causal Discovery on Large Random Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02536)
*Mathieu Chevalley,Arash Mehrjou,Patrick Schwab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that false-negative rates (FNR) in causal discovery concentrate around their mean with increasing dimensionality, especially in scale-free networks, challenging the intuition that high dimensionality hinders accurate causal structure recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide theoretical guarantees for false-negative rates in causal discovery under single-variable interventions and address concerns about high dimensionality and network heterogeneity hindering accurate causal structure recovery.

Method: Analyzed FNR concentration for sparse Erdős-Rényi DAGs and generalized Barabási-Albert graphs using theoretical probability bounds and concentration inequalities, with simulation validation.

Result: FNR concentrates around its mean at rate O(log d/√d) for sparse Erdős-Rényi graphs, and vanishes in the limit for scale-free networks with degree exponent γ > 3, showing reduced variability in orientation error.

Conclusion: Realistic scale-free topologies intrinsically regularize causal discovery, providing dimension-adaptive, faithfulness-robust guarantees that challenge conventional wisdom about dimensionality and network heterogeneity hindering accurate discovery.

Abstract: We investigate theoretical guarantees for the false-negative rate (FNR) --
the fraction of true causal edges whose orientation is not recovered, under
single-variable random interventions and an $\epsilon$-interventional
faithfulness assumption that accommodates latent confounding. For sparse
Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi directed acyclic graphs, where the edge probability scales
as $p_e = \Theta(1/d)$, we show that the FNR concentrates around its mean at
rate $O(\frac{\log d}{\sqrt d})$, implying that large deviations above the
expected error become exponentially unlikely as dimensionality increases. This
concentration ensures that derived upper bounds hold with high probability in
large-scale settings. Extending the analysis to generalized Barab\'asi--Albert
graphs reveals an even stronger phenomenon: when the degree exponent satisfies
$\gamma > 3$, the deviation width scales as $O(d^{\beta - \frac{1}{2}})$ with
$\beta = 1/(\gamma - 1) < \frac{1}{2}$, and hence vanishes in the limit. This
demonstrates that realistic scale-free topologies intrinsically regularize
causal discovery, reducing variability in orientation error. These
finite-dimension results provide the first dimension-adaptive,
faithfulness-robust guarantees for causal structure recovery, and challenge the
intuition that high dimensionality and network heterogeneity necessarily hinder
accurate discovery. Our simulation results corroborate these theoretical
predictions, showing that the FNR indeed concentrates and often vanishes in
practice as dimensionality grows.

### [173] [Adaptive Neighborhood-Constrained Q Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02567)
*Yixiu Mao,Yun Qu,Qi Wang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a neighborhood constraint for offline RL to address extrapolation errors from OOD actions, overcoming limitations of existing constraint types (density, support, sample) by restricting actions to neighborhoods of dataset actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing offline RL constraint methods have inherent limitations: density and sample constraints are overly conservative, while support constraints struggle with accurate behavior policy modeling, leading to extrapolation errors from OOD actions.

Method: Introduces neighborhood constraint that restricts action selection to union of neighborhoods around dataset actions, with adaptive radius based on data quality. Implements ANQ algorithm using bilevel optimization for Q-learning with constrained target actions.

Result: ANQ achieves SOTA performance on standard offline RL benchmarks and shows strong robustness with noisy or limited data. The constraint bounds extrapolation errors and distribution shift while maintaining flexibility.

Conclusion: Neighborhood constraint effectively addresses offline RL limitations by providing a balanced approach between conservatism and flexibility, approximating support constraint benefits without behavior policy modeling requirements.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from extrapolation errors induced
by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, offline RL algorithms
typically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically
categorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show
that each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints
tend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint,
though least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior
policy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint
that restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of
neighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds
extrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also
approximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling.
Moreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism
by adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ
data quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood
constraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop
a simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning
(ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint.
Empirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL
benchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited
data.

*Lukas Fehring,Marcel Wever,Maximilian Spliethöver,Leona Hennig,Henning Wachsmuth,Marius Lindauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to enable user intervention in Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, allowing experts to steer the optimization process with prior distributions while detecting and rejecting misleading inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) lacks user control and acceptance due to its black-box nature. Existing approaches don't allow online steering during optimization.

Method: Generalizes πBO method to enable repeated user interventions via prior distributions, with a misleading prior detection scheme to protect against harmful inputs.

Result: The method effectively incorporates multiple priors, leveraging informative ones while reliably rejecting misleading priors, achieving competitiveness with unperturbed BO.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables expert steering of HPO while maintaining robustness against poor user inputs, making BO more accessible to machine learning experts.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO), for example, based on Bayesian
optimization (BO), supports users in designing models well-suited for a given
dataset. HPO has proven its effectiveness on several applications, ranging from
classical machine learning for tabular data to deep neural networks for
computer vision and transformers for natural language processing. However, HPO
still sometimes lacks acceptance by machine learning experts due to its
black-box nature and limited user control. Addressing this, first approaches
have been proposed to initialize BO methods with expert knowledge. However,
these approaches do not allow for online steering during the optimization
process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that enables repeated
interventions to steer BO via user input, specifying expert knowledge and user
preferences at runtime of the HPO process in the form of prior distributions.
To this end, we generalize an existing method, $\pi$BO, preserving theoretical
guarantees. We also introduce a misleading prior detection scheme, which allows
protection against harmful user inputs. In our experimental evaluation, we
demonstrate that our method can effectively incorporate multiple priors,
leveraging informative priors, whereas misleading priors are reliably rejected
or overcome. Thereby, we achieve competitiveness to unperturbed BO.

### [175] [Directional-Clamp PPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02577)
*Gilad Karpel,Ruida Zhou,Shoham Sabach,Mohammad Ghavamzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Directional-Clamp PPO (DClamp-PPO), which penalizes actions moving in the "wrong" direction during policy optimization by applying a clamp with steeper loss slope when importance ratios fall outside specified bounds relative to advantage signs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO variants mainly focus on modifying clipping in "right" direction regions, but overlook that importance ratios frequently move in "wrong" directions due to randomness in rollouts and policy optimization, which hinders PPO's improvement.

Method: Introduces directional clamping that penalizes actions where advantage is positive but importance ratio falls below 1-β, or advantage is negative but ratio rises above 1+β, using a tunable parameter β ∈ (0,1) to enforce steeper loss slope in wrong direction regions.

Result: DClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO and its variants across various MuJoCo environments with different random seeds, better avoiding wrong direction updates while keeping importance ratios closer to 1.

Conclusion: The proposed directional clamping approach effectively addresses the overlooked issue of wrong direction updates in PPO optimization, leading to improved performance while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is widely regarded as one of the most
successful deep reinforcement learning algorithms, known for its robustness and
effectiveness across a range of problems.
  The PPO objective encourages the importance ratio between the current and
behavior policies to move to the "right" direction -- starting from importance
sampling ratios equal to 1, increasing the ratios for actions with positive
advantages and decreasing those with negative advantages. A clipping function
is introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio
in these "right" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to
extend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering
the clipping in the "right" direction regions. However, due to randomness in
the rollouts and stochasticity of the policy optimization, we observe that the
ratios frequently move to the "wrong" direction during the PPO optimization.
This is a key factor hindering the improvement of PPO, but it has been largely
overlooked. To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm
(DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict "wrong"
direction regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance
ratio falls below (above) $1 - \beta$ ($1+\beta$),
  for a tunable parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$. The penalty is by enforcing a
steeper loss slope, i.e., a clamp, in those regions. We demonstrate that
DClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO, as well as its variants, by focusing
on modifying the objective's behavior in the "right" direction, across various
MuJoCo environments, using different random seeds. The proposed method is
shown, both theoretically and empirically, to better avoid "wrong" direction
updates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve predictive reliability and interpretability in corporate credit scoring by combining language-based reasoning with quantitative learning for transparent, institution-grade credit risk assessment.

Method: Integrates CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost models optimized through Bayesian search under temporal validation, using structured financial data (leverage, profitability, liquidity ratios) from 7,800 corporate credit ratings across multiple agencies.

Result: Achieved mean test AUC above 0.93 across agencies, demonstrating ability to generalize across rating systems and maintain temporal consistency.

Conclusion: Combining language-based reasoning with quantitative learning creates a transparent and institution-grade foundation for reliable corporate credit-risk assessment.

Abstract: We introduce Omega^2, a Large Language Model-driven framework for corporate
credit scoring that combines structured financial data with advanced machine
learning to improve predictive reliability and interpretability. Our study
evaluates Omega^2 on a multi-agency dataset of 7,800 corporate credit ratings
drawn from Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones, each containing
detailed firm-level financial indicators such as leverage, profitability, and
liquidity ratios. The system integrates CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost models
optimized through Bayesian search under temporal validation to ensure
forward-looking and reproducible results. Omega^2 achieved a mean test AUC
above 0.93 across agencies, confirming its ability to generalize across rating
systems and maintain temporal consistency. These results show that combining
language-based reasoning with quantitative learning creates a transparent and
institution-grade foundation for reliable corporate credit-risk assessment.

TL;DR: An automated approach for migrating neural network code between deep learning frameworks using a pivot model abstraction, validated on PyTorch and TensorFlow with successful functional equivalence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual migration of neural networks across frameworks is challenging and time-consuming due to lack of specialized migration approaches, leading to outdated implementations and compatibility issues.

Method: Uses a pivot neural network model to create an abstraction of the NN prior to migration between frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.

Result: Successfully migrated five neural networks with functional equivalence to original implementations, addressing migration challenges between the two frameworks.

Conclusion: The proposed automated migration approach effectively addresses the challenge of moving neural network implementations across different deep learning frameworks while maintaining functional equivalence.

Abstract: The development of smart systems (i.e., systems enhanced with AI components)
has thrived thanks to the rapid advancements in neural networks (NNs). A wide
range of libraries and frameworks have consequently emerged to support NN
design and implementation. The choice depends on factors such as available
functionalities, ease of use, documentation and community support. After
adopting a given NN framework, organizations might later choose to switch to
another if performance declines, requirements evolve, or new features are
introduced. Unfortunately, migrating NN implementations across libraries is
challenging due to the lack of migration approaches specifically tailored for
NNs. This leads to increased time and effort to modernize NNs, as manual
updates are necessary to avoid relying on outdated implementations and ensure
compatibility with new features. In this paper, we propose an approach to
automatically migrate neural network code across deep learning frameworks. Our
method makes use of a pivot NN model to create an abstraction of the NN prior
to migration. We validate our approach using two popular NN frameworks, namely
PyTorch and TensorFlow. We also discuss the challenges of migrating code
between the two frameworks and how they were approached in our method.
Experimental evaluation on five NNs shows that our approach successfully
migrates their code and produces NNs that are functionally equivalent to the
originals. Artefacts from our work are available online.

TL;DR: NAIGNs improve IGNs by replacing adversarial objectives with IMLE, addressing mode collapse and instability while enhancing data restoration and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IGNs suffer from mode collapse, mode dropping, and training instability due to adversarial components, limiting their ability to fully cover the data manifold.

Method: Combines reconstruction loss with non-adversarial IMLE objective, removing adversarial components from IGN framework.

Result: Improved ability to restore corrupted data and generate samples matching data distribution; implicitly learns distance field to data manifold and energy-based model.

Conclusion: NAIGNs successfully address IGN limitations through non-adversarial training, enabling better manifold coverage and additional implicit learning capabilities.

Abstract: Idempotent Generative Networks (IGNs) are deep generative models that also
function as local data manifold projectors, mapping arbitrary inputs back onto
the manifold. They are trained to act as identity operators on the data and as
idempotent operators off the data manifold. However, IGNs suffer from mode
collapse, mode dropping, and training instability due to their objectives,
which contain adversarial components and can cause the model to cover the data
manifold only partially -- an issue shared with generative adversarial
networks. We introduce Non-Adversarial Idempotent Generative Networks (NAIGNs)
to address these issues. Our loss function combines reconstruction with the
non-adversarial generative objective of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation
(IMLE). This improves on IGN's ability to restore corrupted data and generate
new samples that closely match the data distribution. We moreover demonstrate
that NAIGNs implicitly learn the distance field to the data manifold, as well
as an energy-based model.

*David Kattermann,Lothar Sebastian Krapp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies computable PAC learning and shows that the traditional VC-dimension characterization fails in this framework. It establishes connections between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable classes, revealing that effective VC-dimensions can exceed traditional ones, and provides new characterizations of learnability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how computability requirements affect PAC learning theory, particularly why the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning breaks down when learners must be computable functions, and to develop effective analogs of learning theory concepts.

Method: Investigates the relationship between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable (RER) classes, analyzes effective VC-dimensions, and establishes new characterizations of learnability through containment properties and unique identification.

Result: Shows that effective VC-dimensions can be arbitrarily larger than traditional VC-dimensions even for RER classes, establishes that CPAC learnability can be characterized via RER class containment, and proves that agnostic learnability is achievable for RER classes through nonuniform CPAC learning.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of CPAC learning, revealing that while traditional VC-dimension theory fails in the computable setting, new effective characterizations and connections with RER classes can recover analogs of fundamental learning theory results.

Abstract: We study computable probably approximately correct (CPAC) learning, where
learners are required to be computable functions. It had been previously
observed that the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning, which
characterizes PAC learnability by finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
(VC-)dimension, no longer holds in this framework. Recent works recovered
analogs of the Fundamental Theorem in the computable setting, for instance by
introducing an effective VC-dimension. Guided by this, we investigate the
connection between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable (RER)
classes, whose members can be algorithmically listed. Our results show that the
effective VC-dimensions can take arbitrary values above the traditional one,
even for RER classes, which creates a whole family of (non-)examples for
various notions of CPAC learning. Yet the two dimensions coincide for classes
satisfying sufficiently strong notions of CPAC learning. We then observe that
CPAC learnability can also be characterized via containment of RER classes that
realize the same samples. Furthermore, it is shown that CPAC learnable classes
satisfying a unique identification property are necessarily RER. Finally, we
establish that agnostic learnability can be guaranteed for RER classes, by
considering the relaxed notion of nonuniform CPAC learning.

TL;DR: GasRL is a simulator combining natural gas market modeling with deep reinforcement learning for storage management, showing SAC algorithm achieves optimal policies that match real price dynamics and improve market resilience under EU storage thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how optimal stockpile management affects equilibrium prices and market dynamics in natural gas markets, and to assess the impact of regulatory policies like EU-mandated storage thresholds.

Method: Developed GasRL simulator coupling calibrated natural gas market representation with deep reinforcement learning (RL) trained storage-operator policies, testing various RL algorithms including Soft Actor Critic (SAC).

Result: SAC exhibited superior performance, achieving multiple storage operator objectives (profitability, market clearing, price stabilization) and producing equilibrium price dynamics that closely match real-world characteristics without explicit price data calibration. EU storage thresholds improved market resilience against supply shocks.

Conclusion: The GasRL simulator effectively models natural gas market dynamics with RL-trained storage policies, demonstrating that SAC-derived optimal policies naturally replicate real price patterns and that regulatory storage thresholds enhance market stability against supply disruptions.

Abstract: We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of
the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with
deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile
management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We
test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits
superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage
operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price
stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price
dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as
volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices.
Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained
without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the
simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage
thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market
resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks.
For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more
often if a threshold is in place.

TL;DR: Hybrid LLMs combining transformer attention with State Space Models (SSMs) achieve 2x higher inference throughput with minimal reasoning performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers suffer from quadratic complexity and caching requirements that limit throughput, while SSMs offer linear complexity and constant memory footprint for more efficient deployment.

Method: Incremental distillation from pretrained transformer, progressively replacing less critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks to create hybrid SSM-Transformer models.

Result: Multiple variants with different SSM-to-MHA ratios show minimal reasoning degradation while achieving over 2x higher inference throughput in production environments.

Conclusion: Distilled hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures deliver substantial efficiency gains without substantially compromising reasoning quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable reasoning capabilities
through transformer architectures with attention mechanisms. However,
transformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention
module (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which
severely limits throughput and scalability. High inference throughput is
critical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under
high request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.
  State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with
linear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent
computation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we
introduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer
attention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size.
These models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained
reasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing
less critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.
  We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with
different SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as
more Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant
of Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces,
achieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the
production-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning
performance. This shows that distilled hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures can
deliver substantial efficiency gains over the pretrained transformer equivalent
without substantially compromising the reasoning quality.

*Cooper Simpson,Stephen Becker,Alireza Doostan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel in situ training protocol using implicit neural representations with memory buffers of full and sketched data to prevent catastrophic forgetting, achieving high compression rates and matching offline method performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning scenarios, particularly for in situ neural compression using implicit neural representation-based hypernetworks.

Method: In situ training with limited memory buffers containing both full and sketched data samples, using sketching as a regularizer based on Johnson-Lindenstrauss theory.

Result: Strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates on complex 2D/3D simulation data over long time horizons, unstructured grids, and non-Cartesian geometries.

Conclusion: Sketching enables the in situ scheme to approximately match the performance of equivalent offline methods, making it valuable for continual learning applications.

Abstract: Focusing on implicit neural representations, we present a novel in situ
training protocol that employs limited memory buffers of full and sketched data
samples, where the sketched data are leveraged to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. The theoretical motivation for our use of sketching as a
regularizer is presented via a simple Johnson-Lindenstrauss-informed result.
While our methods may be of wider interest in the field of continual learning,
we specifically target in situ neural compression using implicit neural
representation-based hypernetworks. We evaluate our method on a variety of
complex simulation data in two and three dimensions, over long time horizons,
and across unstructured grids and non-Cartesian geometries. On these tasks, we
show strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates. Most
importantly, we demonstrate that sketching enables the presented in situ scheme
to approximately match the performance of the equivalent offline method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dual challenges of communication efficiency and robustness in federated learning systems where Byzantine adversaries can exhibit arbitrary malicious behaviors.

Method: Proposes Byrd-NAFL algorithm that seamlessly integrates Nesterov's momentum into federated learning with Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules to handle gradient corruption.

Result: Establishes finite-time convergence guarantee under non-convex and smooth loss functions with relaxed gradient assumptions. Extensive experiments show superiority in convergence speed, accuracy, and resilience to various Byzantine attacks.

Conclusion: Byrd-NAFL effectively combines acceleration techniques with Byzantine resilience, providing a robust and efficient solution for federated learning in adversarial environments.

Abstract: We investigate robust federated learning, where a group of workers
collaboratively train a shared model under the orchestration of a central
server in the presence of Byzantine adversaries capable of arbitrary and
potentially malicious behaviors. To simultaneously enhance communication
efficiency and robustness against such adversaries, we propose a
Byzantine-resilient Nesterov-Accelerated Federated Learning (Byrd-NAFL)
algorithm. Byrd-NAFL seamlessly integrates Nesterov's momentum into the
federated learning process alongside Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules to
achieve fast and safeguarding convergence against gradient corruption. We
establish a finite-time convergence guarantee for Byrd-NAFL under non-convex
and smooth loss functions with relaxed assumption on the aggregated gradients.
Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of Byrd-NAFL and
demonstrate the superiority over existing benchmarks in terms of convergence
speed, accuracy, and resilience to diverse Byzantine attack strategies.

TL;DR: This paper addresses compositional generalization in machine learning by introducing a rigorous evaluation framework, extensive benchmarking of vision backbones, and Attribute Invariant Networks that achieve significant improvements with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation protocols for compositional generalization lack standardization and rigor, while existing approaches compromise scalability. Vision architectures lack necessary inductive biases for compositional reasoning.

Method: 1) A rigorous evaluation framework that unifies previous approaches with reduced computational requirements; 2) Extensive evaluation training over 5000 models; 3) Attribute Invariant Networks that establish a new Pareto frontier.

Result: Attribute Invariant Networks achieve 23.43% accuracy improvement over baselines while reducing parameter overhead from 600% to 16% compared to fully disentangled counterparts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and Attribute Invariant Networks provide a scalable solution for compositional generalization, establishing new state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Compositional generalization-a key open challenge in modern machine
learning-requires models to predict unknown combinations of known concepts.
However, assessing compositional generalization remains a fundamental challenge
due to the lack of standardized evaluation protocols and the limitations of
current benchmarks, which often favor efficiency over rigor. At the same time,
general-purpose vision architectures lack the necessary inductive biases, and
existing approaches to endow them compromise scalability. As a remedy, this
paper introduces: 1) a rigorous evaluation framework that unifies and extends
previous approaches while reducing computational requirements from
combinatorial to constant; 2) an extensive and modern evaluation on the status
of compositional generalization in supervised vision backbones, training more
than 5000 models; 3) Attribute Invariant Networks, a class of models
establishing a new Pareto frontier in compositional generalization, achieving a
23.43% accuracy improvement over baselines while reducing parameter overhead
from 600% to 16% compared to fully disentangled counterparts.

*Georgios Tzannetos,Parameswaran Kamalaruban,Adish Singla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Curriculum learning strategy that gradually tightens constraints during training to help agents master deployment requirements, validated in RL and LLM settings with theoretical analysis and empirical results showing accelerated training and inference speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training agents to operate under strict deployment constraints (like limited resources or safety requirements) is challenging when constraints make tasks complex.

Method: Curriculum learning approach that starts with simplified constraints and progressively introduces full deployment conditions, inspired by self-paced learning in unconstrained RL.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows accelerated training vs baseline; empirical validation across RL and LLM agents demonstrates effectiveness in binary-tree MDP, navigation domains, and math reasoning tasks. LLM application achieves substantial inference speedup via compressed chain-of-thought tokens.

Conclusion: Curriculum design enhances efficiency and performance of agents under complex trajectory constraints, with practical benefits for resource-constrained deployment including inference speedup on consumer hardware.

Abstract: Training agents to operate under strict constraints during deployment, such
as limited resource budgets or stringent safety requirements, presents
significant challenges, especially when these constraints render the task
complex. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually
tightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally
master the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques
in unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a
smoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on
simplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full
deployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a
binary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum
strategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes
the trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate
the effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large
language model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a
multi-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the
efficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory
constraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy
enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial
inference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for
resource-constrained deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAR-VAE is a Transformer-based variational autoencoder for molecular generation that uses SELFIES representations to ensure validity, enables conditional generation via property predictors, and supports efficient finetuning with LoRA adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vast chemical space of drug-like molecules requires generative models that can learn broad distributions, enable conditional generation based on properties, and provide fast generation, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Method: Transformer-based VAE with SELFIES encoding for validity, latent-variable formulation for conditional generation using property predictors, and LoRA adapters for efficient finetuning with limited data.

Result: Matches or exceeds baselines on GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks, shows smooth latent representations, and improves docking scores on Tartarus benchmarks for property-guided generation.

Conclusion: Modernized VAEs with principled conditioning and parameter-efficient finetuning remain competitive for molecular generation tasks.

Abstract: The chemical space of drug-like molecules is vast, motivating the development
of generative models that must learn broad chemical distributions, enable
conditional generation by capturing structure-property representations, and
provide fast molecular generation. Meeting the objectives depends on modeling
choices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional
generative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input
representation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE
(Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder),
a scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an
autoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like
molecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The
latent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property
predictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the
latent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are:
(i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on
SELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable
formulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with
low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation
with limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks,
our approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal
smooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional
exploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the
conditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted
binding. These results suggest that a modernized, scale-appropriate VAE remains
competitive for molecular generation when paired with principled conditioning
and parameter-efficient finetuning.

### [187] [Does Interpretability of Knowledge Tracing Models Support Teacher Decision Making?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02718)
*Adia Khalid,Alina Deriyeva,Benjamin Paassen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study investigates whether interpretable knowledge tracing (KT) models actually help human teachers make better pedagogical decisions, finding that while teachers prefer interpretable models, their actual decision-making performance doesn't significantly differ from using non-interpretable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine if the interpretability of KT models genuinely assists human teachers in making teaching decisions, given that KT models are typically required to be interpretable for high-stakes pedagogical decisions but no prior research has tested this assumption.

Method: Conducted two studies: 1) a simulation study comparing decisions based on interpretable vs non-interpretable KT models, and 2) a human study with N=12 teachers making teaching decisions using information from different KT models while measuring usability, trustworthiness, and task efficiency.

Result: Simulation study showed interpretable KT models achieved mastery faster, but human teacher study revealed no significant difference in number of tasks needed for mastery between model types, despite teachers rating interpretable models higher in usability and trustworthiness.

Conclusion: The relationship between model interpretability and teacher decisions is complex - teachers don't rely solely on KT models, and further research is needed to understand how learners and teachers actually use KT models in practice.

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) models are a crucial basis for pedagogical
decision-making, namely which task to select next for a learner and when to
stop teaching a particular skill. Given the high stakes of pedagogical
decisions, KT models are typically required to be interpretable, in the sense
that they should implement an explicit model of human learning and provide
explicit estimates of learners' abilities. However, to our knowledge, no study
to date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually
helps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we
perform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on
interpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a
non-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human
teachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT
models. As expected, teachers rate interpretable KT models higher in terms of
usability and trustworthiness. However, the number of tasks needed until
mastery hardly differs between KT models. This suggests that the relationship
between model interpretability and teacher decisions is not straightforward:
teachers do not solely rely on KT models to make decisions and further research
is needed to investigate how learners and teachers actually understand and use
KT models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Calibrating base machine learning models improves accuracy and robustness of mislabeled instance detection in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mislabeled data undermines ML system performance in real-world applications, and current detection methods rely on base model properties which are crucial for effectiveness.

Method: Investigating the impact of calibrating the base machine learning model used for mislabeling detection, which involves training a base model and probing it for trust scores.

Result: Empirical results show that using calibration methods improves both accuracy and robustness of mislabeled instance detection.

Conclusion: Model calibration provides a practical and effective solution for industrial applications dealing with mislabeled data.

Abstract: Mislabeled data is a pervasive issue that undermines the performance of
machine learning systems in real-world applications. An effective approach to
mitigate this problem is to detect mislabeled instances and subject them to
special treatment, such as filtering or relabeling. Automatic mislabeling
detection methods typically rely on training a base machine learning model and
then probing it for each instance to obtain a trust score that each provided
label is genuine or incorrect. The properties of this base model are thus of
paramount importance. In this paper, we investigate the impact of calibrating
this model. Our empirical results show that using calibration methods improves
the accuracy and robustness of mislabeled instance detection, providing a
practical and effective solution for industrial applications.

*Morgan Allen,Paul Savala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes MLB game predictions using machine learning models, showing a relationship between predicted win probability and actual win strength, and evaluates their use in run-line betting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend previous MLB prediction work by training comprehensive ML models on a common dataset and relate win probabilities to actual win strength measured by score differential.

Method: Trained multiple machine learning models using a common dataset, analyzed the relationship between predicted win probabilities and win strength (score differential), and tested these predictions in run-line betting scenarios.

Result: Found that common ML models demonstrate a relationship between predicted win probability and actual win strength. Positive returns were achieved with appropriate betting strategies, while naive use of ML models led to significant losses.

Conclusion: Machine learning models can effectively predict MLB game outcomes and win strength, but require careful betting strategy implementation to generate positive returns rather than naive application.

Abstract: In Major League Baseball, strategy and planning are major factors in
determining the outcome of a game. Previous studies have aided this by building
machine learning models for predicting the winning team of any given game. We
extend this work by training a comprehensive set of machine learning models
using a common dataset. In addition, we relate the win probabilities produced
by these models to win strength as measured by score differential. In doing so
we show that the most common machine learning models do indeed demonstrate a
relationship between predicted win probability and the strength of the win.
Finally, we analyze the results of using predicted win probabilities as a
decision making mechanism on run-line betting. We demonstrate positive returns
when utilizing appropriate betting strategies, and show that naive use of
machine learning models for betting lead to significant loses.

*Lejs Deen Behric,Liang Zhang,Bingcong Li,Kiran Koshy Thekumparampil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConMeZO is a novel zeroth-order optimizer that accelerates convergence for LLM finetuning by using adaptive directional sampling within a cone centered around momentum, achieving 2X speedup over MeZO while maintaining low memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) is attractive for finetuning LLMs due to low memory overhead, but suffers from slow convergence in high-dimensional parameter spaces.

Method: ConMeZO restricts directional sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate instead of uniform random sampling, concentrating search in directions where the true gradient is more likely to lie.

Result: ConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO theoretically, and empirically shows up to 2X faster convergence when finetuning LLMs on natural language tasks.

Conclusion: ConMeZO successfully accelerates zeroth-order optimization for LLM finetuning while preserving the memory efficiency advantages of derivative-free methods.

Abstract: Zeroth-order or derivative-free optimization (MeZO) is an attractive strategy
for finetuning large language models (LLMs) because it eliminates the memory
overhead of backpropagation. However, it converges slowly due to the inherent
curse of dimensionality when searching for descent directions in the
high-dimensional parameter space of billion-scale LLMs. We propose ConMeZO, a
novel zeroth-order optimizer that accelerates convergence by adaptive
directional sampling. Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random,
ConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate.
This concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more
likely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that
ConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO. Empirically,
when finetuning LLMs on natural language tasks, ConMeZO is up to 2X faster than
MeZO while retaining the low-memory footprint of zeroth-order methods.

TL;DR: SoCo is a framework that transfers solo knowledge into cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, using pretrained solo policies and policy fusion to boost training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training multi-agent systems from scratch is inefficient, and existing methods still rely on costly multi-agent data. Solo experiences are easier to obtain in many scenarios like collaborative coding and search-and-rescue.

Method: Pretrains a shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation through policy fusion with MoE-like gating selector and action editor.

Result: Significantly boosts training efficiency and performance across diverse cooperative tasks compared to backbone algorithms.

Conclusion: Solo demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data, making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.

Abstract: Training a team of agents from scratch in multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) is highly inefficient, much like asking beginners to play a symphony
together without first practicing solo. Existing methods, such as offline or
transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly
multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo
experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g.,
collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock
their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that
transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a
shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation
during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an
MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse
cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency
and performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo
demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data,
making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.

*Xinghan Li,Haodong Wen,Kaifeng Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adam optimizer implicitly reduces a unique sharpness measure shaped by its adaptive updates, leading to qualitatively different solutions from SGD. While SGD minimizes trace of Hessian (tr(H)), Adam minimizes tr(Diag(H)^(1/2)), enabling better sparsity and generalization in certain settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite Adam's popularity, most theoretical analyses study SGD as a proxy, and little is known about how Adam's solutions differ from SGD's. The paper aims to understand the fundamental differences between Adam and SGD optimization behaviors.

Method: The authors use continuous-time approximation with stochastic differential equations to rigorously characterize Adam's behavior. They analyze how Adam wanders around minimizer manifolds and takes semi-gradients to minimize sharpness adaptively.

Result: In overparameterized models with label noise, SGD minimizes tr(H) while Adam minimizes tr(Diag(H)^(1/2)). In sparse linear regression with diagonal linear networks, Adam achieves better sparsity and generalization than SGD.

Conclusion: The analysis framework extends to various adaptive gradient methods (RMSProp, Adam-mini, Adalayer, Shampoo) and provides a unified perspective on how adaptive optimizers reduce sharpness, offering insights for future optimizer design.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the Adam optimizer in practice, most theoretical
analyses study Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as a proxy for Adam, and
little is known about how the solutions found by Adam differ. In this paper, we
show that Adam implicitly reduces a unique form of sharpness measure shaped by
its adaptive updates, leading to qualitatively different solutions from SGD.
More specifically, when the training loss is small, Adam wanders around the
manifold of minimizers and takes semi-gradients to minimize this sharpness
measure in an adaptive manner, a behavior we rigorously characterize through a
continuous-time approximation using stochastic differential equations. We
further demonstrate how this behavior differs from that of SGD in a
well-studied setting: when training overparameterized models with label noise,
SGD has been shown to minimize the trace of the Hessian matrix, $\tr(\mH)$,
whereas we prove that Adam minimizes $\tr(\Diag(\mH)^{1/2})$ instead. In
solving sparse linear regression with diagonal linear networks, this
distinction enables Adam to achieve better sparsity and generalization than
SGD. Finally, our analysis framework extends beyond Adam to a broad class of
adaptive gradient methods, including RMSProp, Adam-mini, Adalayer and Shampoo,
and provides a unified perspective on how these adaptive optimizers reduce
sharpness, which we hope will offer insights for future optimizer design.

*Andras Ferenczi,Sutapa Samanta,Dagen Wang,Todd Hodges*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a QUBO-based client selection method for federated learning that significantly reduces privacy exposure while maintaining model accuracy by selecting only the most relevant client updates each round.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate privacy risks in federated learning where multiple training iterations increase cumulative exposure to membership inference, property inference, and model inversion attacks.

Method: Uses quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation to select a small subset of most relevant client updates for each training round, assuming a trusted central server with access to validation data.

Result: Experiments on MNIST with 300 clients showed 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with 147 clients never used while maintaining full-aggregation accuracy. CINIC-10 experiments showed 82% per-round and 33% cumulative privacy improvement.

Conclusion: The QUBO-based client selection method effectively reduces privacy exposure in federated learning while preserving model performance, proving efficient across different scales and model complexities.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning
(ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without
centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing
sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a
client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can
launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client
participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a
client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs),
thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing
inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client
exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates
most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat
vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii)
adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted
central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes
that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data
distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds
showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with
147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in
general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be
efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10
dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy
improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs perform poorly on subtraction compared to addition, especially when results should be negative. While models internally encode negative sign information, they often omit it in outputs. Instruction-tuning significantly improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subtraction has received little attention in LLM benchmarks despite being structurally distinct as a non-commutative operation, unlike addition and multiplication.

Method: Evaluated eight pretrained LLMs from four families on addition and subtraction problems. Analyzed error patterns and tested few-shot learning and instruction-tuning techniques.

Result: Subtraction accuracy lags significantly behind addition. Errors are concentrated in cases where a<b, with LLMs producing correct magnitude but omitting negative sign. Instruction-tuned models achieve near-perfect accuracy for negative signs.

Conclusion: LLMs have limitations in subtraction arithmetic, particularly with negative signs, but these issues are recoverable through instruction-tuning, providing clearer characterization of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs).
While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has
received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as
a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four
families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that
subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the
errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs
frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing
analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative,
yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further
test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to
see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while
few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve
near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these
findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and
recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.

Motivation: Federated Learning ensures data privacy but makes it challenging to protect against attackers who want to compromise the training outcome through model poisoning attacks.

Method: FPP uses participants' assessments to evaluate rounds, enables training recovery after attacks, and employs a reputation-based mechanism to mitigate attacker participation. It was validated in a dockerized environment against FedAvg, Power-of-Choice, and aggregation via Trimmed Mean and Median.

Result: Experiments show FPP achieves rapid convergence rate and can converge even with malicious participants performing model poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: FPP successfully safeguards federated training while maintaining data privacy through its security mechanisms and reputation system.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training paradigm wherein
participants collaborate to build a global model while ensuring the privacy of
the involved data, which remains stored on participant devices. However,
proposals aiming to ensure such privacy also make it challenging to protect
against potential attackers seeking to compromise the training outcome. In this
context, we present Fast, Private, and Protected (FPP), a novel approach that
aims to safeguard federated training while enabling secure aggregation to
preserve data privacy. This is accomplished by evaluating rounds using
participants' assessments and enabling training recovery after an attack. FPP
also employs a reputation-based mechanism to mitigate the participation of
attackers. We created a dockerized environment to validate the performance of
FPP compared to other approaches in the literature (FedAvg, Power-of-Choice,
and aggregation via Trimmed Mean and Median). Our experiments demonstrate that
FPP achieves a rapid convergence rate and can converge even in the presence of
malicious participants performing model poisoning attacks.

*Hakob Tamazyan,Ani Vanyan,Alvard Barseghyan,Anna Khosrovyan,Evan Shelhamer,Hrant Khachatrian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeoCrossBench extends GeoBench with cross-satellite evaluation protocol, showing foundation models underperform DINOv3 in-distribution but proposed ChiViT excels at generalization to satellites with no band overlap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing satellites are diversifying while labeled data comes from older satellites, making cross-satellite generalization crucial as foundation models scale up.

Method: Developed GeoCrossBench benchmark with new evaluation protocol and ChiViT (self-supervised extension of ChannelViT) to improve cross-satellite performance.

Result: Foundation models underperform DINOv3 in-distribution; all models suffer 2-4x performance drop with no band overlap (ChiViT outperforms); performance drops 5-25% with additional bands; fine-tuning last layer achieves consistent performance across satellites.

Conclusion: Benchmark is far from saturated, highlighting need for more future-proof remote sensing models with stronger cross-satellite generalization.

Abstract: The number and diversity of remote sensing satellites grows over time, while
the vast majority of labeled data comes from older satellites. As the
foundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to
support new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the
models towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we
introduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a
new evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance;
generalization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to
satellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also
develop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its
cross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation
models for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose
models like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to
new satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in
performance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third,
the performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\% when given
additional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the
last linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get
relatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the
benchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the
datasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing
models with stronger cross-satellite generalization.

*Abhishek Panigrahi,Bingbin Liu,Sadhika Malladi,Sham Kakade,Surbhi Goel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRACE is a lightweight score that quantifies teacher effectiveness for knowledge distillation without needing verifiers, teacher logits, or test data, achieving up to 86% correlation with distilled student performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge distillation methods require expensive trial-and-error to select optimal teachers for specific student-task combinations, creating inefficiency in the distillation process.

Method: GRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients from an information-theoretic perspective, connecting to leave-one-out stability of gradient-based algorithms to predict generalization performance.

Result: GRACE achieves up to 86% Spearman correlation with distilled student performance on GSM8K and MATH, improving performance by up to 7.4% over naive teacher selection. It also provides guidance on distillation design choices like temperature settings and teacher selection.

Conclusion: GRACE efficiently identifies compatible teachers for knowledge distillation and provides fine-grained guidance for distillation optimization, making the process more effective and less resource-intensive.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an efficient strategy to use data generated by
large "teacher" language models to train smaller capable "student" models, but
selecting the optimal teacher for a specific student-task combination requires
expensive trial-and-error. We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to
quantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model.
GRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients without
access to a verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. From an
information-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of
gradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the
distilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86%
Spearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo
students. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher
can improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the
best-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design
choices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when
generating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size
constraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively
identify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide
fine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation.

TL;DR: Two-stage optimization strategy for opto-electronic CNNs that first trains electronic CNN then optimizes optical metasurface front-end, achieving better accuracy and efficiency than end-to-end training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of conventional end-to-end optimization for opto-electronic neural networks, which suffers from costly simulations and large parameter spaces.

Method: Two-stage design: 1) Train standard electronic CNN, 2) Realize optical front-end (metasurface array) through direct kernel optimization of first convolutional layer.

Result: Reduces computational and memory demands by hundreds of times, improves training stability, and achieves twice the accuracy of end-to-end training on monocular depth estimation under same constraints.

Conclusion: The two-stage optimization strategy is more efficient and effective for designing opto-electronic CNNs compared to end-to-end approaches.

Abstract: Opto-electronic neural networks integrate optical front-ends with electronic
back-ends to enable fast and energy-efficient vision. However, conventional
end-to-end optimization of both the optical and electronic modules is limited
by costly simulations and large parameter spaces. We introduce a two-stage
strategy for designing opto-electronic convolutional neural networks (CNNs):
first, train a standard electronic CNN, then realize the optical front-end
implemented as a metasurface array through direct kernel optimization of its
first convolutional layer. This approach reduces computational and memory
demands by hundreds of times and improves training stability compared to
end-to-end optimization. On monocular depth estimation, the proposed two-stage
design achieves twice the accuracy of end-to-end training under the same
training time and resource constraints.

TL;DR: MammoClean is a framework for standardizing mammography datasets and quantifying bias to improve AI model generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneity in mammography datasets causes dataset-specific biases that compromise AI model generalizability, hindering clinical deployment.

Method: MammoClean standardizes case selection, image processing (laterality and intensity correction), and unifies metadata into consistent multi-view structure. It systematically identifies bias sources through comprehensive review of breast anatomy and imaging characteristics.

Result: Applied to three datasets (CBIS-DDSM, TOMPEI-CMMD, VinDr-Mammo), MammoClean quantified substantial distributional shifts in breast density and abnormality prevalence. AI models trained on corrupted datasets showed significant performance degradation compared to curated counterparts.

Conclusion: MammoClean enables construction of unified multi-dataset training corpora for developing robust AI models with superior cross-domain generalization, providing a reproducible pipeline for bias-aware AI development in mammography.

Abstract: The development of clinically reliable artificial intelligence (AI) systems
for mammography is hindered by profound heterogeneity in data quality, metadata
standards, and population distributions across public datasets. This
heterogeneity introduces dataset-specific biases that severely compromise the
generalizability of the model, a fundamental barrier to clinical deployment. We
present MammoClean, a public framework for standardization and bias
quantification in mammography datasets. MammoClean standardizes case selection,
image processing (including laterality and intensity correction), and unifies
metadata into a consistent multi-view structure. We provide a comprehensive
review of breast anatomy, imaging characteristics, and public mammography
datasets to systematically identify key sources of bias. Applying MammoClean to
three heterogeneous datasets (CBIS-DDSM, TOMPEI-CMMD, VinDr-Mammo), we quantify
substantial distributional shifts in breast density and abnormality prevalence.
Critically, we demonstrate the direct impact of data corruption: AI models
trained on corrupted datasets exhibit significant performance degradation
compared to their curated counterparts. By using MammoClean to identify and
mitigate bias sources, researchers can construct unified multi-dataset training
corpora that enable development of robust models with superior cross-domain
generalization. MammoClean provides an essential, reproducible pipeline for
bias-aware AI development in mammography, facilitating fairer comparisons and
advancing the creation of safe, effective systems that perform equitably across
diverse patient populations and clinical settings. The open-source code is
publicly available from: https://github.com/Minds-R-Lab/MammoClean.

*Alix de Langlais,Benjamin Billot,Théo Aguilar Vidal,Marc-Olivier Gauci,Hervé Delingette*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SCORE is a weakly supervised framework that refines medical image segmentation predictions using only light feedback during training, eliminating the need for dense annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual medical image segmentation is labor-intensive and variable, while current automated approaches often lack clinical accuracy and refinement methods require heavy supervision.

Method: SCORE introduces a novel loss function that leverages region-wise quality scores and over/under-segmentation error labels instead of dense training annotations.

Result: SCORE significantly improves initial predictions from TotalSegmentator on humerus CT scans, achieving performance comparable to existing refinement methods while greatly reducing supervision requirements.

Conclusion: SCORE provides an effective weakly supervised approach for medical image segmentation refinement that reduces annotation burden while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Delineating anatomical regions is a key task in medical image analysis.
Manual segmentation achieves high accuracy but is labor-intensive and prone to
variability, thus prompting the development of automated approaches. Recently,
a breadth of foundation models has enabled automated segmentations across
diverse anatomies and imaging modalities, but these may not always meet the
clinical accuracy standards. While segmentation refinement strategies can
improve performance, current methods depend on heavy user interactions or
require fully supervised segmentations for training. Here, we present SCORE
(Segmentation COrrection from Regional Evaluations), a weakly supervised
framework that learns to refine mask predictions only using light feedback
during training. Specifically, instead of relying on dense training image
annotations, SCORE introduces a novel loss that leverages region-wise quality
scores and over/under-segmentation error labels. We demonstrate SCORE on
humerus CT scans, where it considerably improves initial predictions from
TotalSegmentator, and achieves performance on par with existing refinement
methods, while greatly reducing their supervision requirements and annotation
time. Our code is available at: https://gitlab.inria.fr/adelangl/SCORE.

TL;DR: Diffusion models provide a low-cost path to adversarial robustness for image classification and object detection without full adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks challenge standard models by perturbing inputs to force incorrect predictions, and existing approaches using adversarial training increase training costs significantly.

Method: Build models on top of off-the-shelf diffusion models to extract robust representations, then train lightweight heads on frozen features without adversarial training.

Result: Diffusion-based classifiers and detectors achieve meaningful adversarial robustness with minimal compute on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and PASCAL VOC, though clean and adversarial accuracies remain below state-of-the-art adversarially trained models.

Conclusion: Diffusion pretraining offers a favorable tradeoff between efficiency and robustness, opening a promising avenue for integrating diffusion models into resource-constrained robust deployments.

Abstract: Diffusion models have gained significant attention for high-fidelity image
generation. Our work investigates the potential of exploiting diffusion models
for adversarial robustness in image classification and object detection.
Adversarial attacks challenge standard models in these tasks by perturbing
inputs to force incorrect predictions. To address this issue, many approaches
use training schemes for forcing the robustness of the models, which increase
training costs. In this work, we study models built on top of off-the-shelf
diffusion models and demonstrate their practical significance: they provide a
low-cost path to robust representations, allowing lightweight heads to be
trained on frozen features without full adversarial training. Our empirical
evaluations on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and PASCAL VOC show that diffusion-based
classifiers and detectors achieve meaningful adversarial robustness with
minimal compute. While clean and adversarial accuracies remain below
state-of-the-art adversarially trained CNNs or ViTs, diffusion pretraining
offers a favorable tradeoff between efficiency and robustness. This work opens
a promising avenue for integrating diffusion models into resource-constrained
robust deployments.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper proposes optimization strategies for neural receivers using quantization and compression to reduce computational cost and memory footprint while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural receivers have high computational costs that challenge deployment on hardware-constrained devices, requiring optimization strategies to reduce complexity.

Method: Introduces uniform and non-uniform quantization (including Fibonacci Code word Quantization), proposes fine-grained Incremental Network Quantization to compensate losses, and develops two novel lossless compression algorithms for quantized parameters.

Result: Quantization saves 45% in multiplier power and 44% in area; combined with compression achieves 63.4% memory footprint reduction while outperforming conventional receivers.

Conclusion: The proposed quantization and compression techniques effectively optimize neural receivers for hardware-constrained deployment while maintaining superior performance over conventional approaches.

Abstract: Neural receivers have shown outstanding performance compared to the
conventional ones but this comes with a high network complexity leading to a
heavy computational cost. This poses significant challenges in their deployment
on hardware-constrained devices. To address the issue, this paper explores two
optimization strategies: quantization and compression. We introduce both
uniform and non-uniform quantization such as the Fibonacci Code word
Quantization (FCQ). A novel fine-grained approach to the Incremental Network
Quantization (INQ) strategy is then proposed to compensate for the losses
introduced by the above mentioned quantization techniques. Additionally, we
introduce two novel lossless compression algorithms that effectively reduce the
memory size by compressing sequences of Fibonacci quantized parameters
characterized by a huge redundancy. The quantization technique provides a
saving of 45\% and 44\% in the multiplier's power and area, respectively, and
its combination with the compression determines a 63.4\% reduction in memory
footprint, while still providing higher performances than a conventional
receiver.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSO communication is promising for ISLs but sensitive to beam misalignment. PAA compensation requires precise orbital knowledge and advanced hardware that aren't always feasible, creating a practical challenge for reliable FSO systems.

Method: Derived closed-form CDF for FSO channel under joint jitter and misalignment errors, introduced truncated CDF formulation with bisection algorithm for efficient outage probability computation, and quantified displacement using orbital dynamics.

Result: Numerical results show the proposed model closely matches Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating high accuracy and practical utility for designing inter-satellite FSO systems.

Conclusion: The proposed model provides an efficient and accurate method for analyzing beam misalignment effects in inter-satellite FSO communication, making it highly useful for practical system design with guaranteed convergence and minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Free-space optical (FSO) communication has emerged as a promising technology
for inter-satellite links (ISLs) due to its high data rate, low power
consumption, and reduced interference. However, the performance of
inter-satellite FSO systems is highly sensitive to beam misalignment. While
pointing-ahead angle (PAA) compensation is commonly employed, the effectiveness
of PAA compensation depends on precise orbital knowledge and advanced alignment
hardware, which are not always feasible in practice. To address this challenge,
this paper investigates the impact of beam misalignment on inter-satellite FSO
communication. We derive a closed-form expression for the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of the FSO channel under the joint jitter and
misalignment-induced pointing error, and introduce a truncated CDF formulation
with a bisection algorithm to efficiently compute outage probabilities with
guaranteed convergence and minimal computational overhead. To make the analysis
more practical, we quantify displacement based on orbital dynamics. Numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed model closely matches Monte Carlo
simulations, making the proposed model highly useful to design inter-satellite
FSO systems in practice.

Motivation: Next-generation wireless systems need ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) for mission-critical applications, which is challenging for two-hop cooperative communication due to stringent latency and reliability requirements.

Method: Develops adaptive transmission design where each hop configures parameters separately (numerology, mini-slot size, MCS). Formulates as Markov decision process and proposes dual-agent reinforcement learning algorithm (DRL-CoLA) for distributed learning of latency-aware policies.

Result: Simulation results show the algorithm achieves near-optimal reliability while satisfying strict latency requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL-CoLA algorithm effectively addresses URLLC challenges in two-hop relaying systems through adaptive parameter configuration and distributed reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Next-generation wireless communication systems must support ultra-reliable

Meeting stringent URLLC requirements is challenging, especially for two-hop

design for a two-hop relaying communication system. Each hop transmission
adaptively configures its transmission parameters separately, including
numerology, mini-slot size, and modulation and coding scheme, for reliable
packet transmission within a strict latency constraint. We formulate the
hop-specific transceiver configuration as a Markov decision process (MDP) and
propose a dual-agent reinforcement learning-based cooperative latency-aware

in a distributed manner. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm
achieves the near-optimal reliability while satisfying strict latency
requirements.

Used variable-substitution to transform the non-convex problem into convex form, then solved using Lagrangian duality and alternating optimization. Derived closed-form solutions for three fairness regimes.

Result: Numerical results show the CER-enabled framework achieves significant throughput gains and adaptability over benchmark schemes. The tunable alpha fairness mechanism provides flexible control over performance-fairness trade-offs across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: Cooperative energy recycling effectively enhances wireless-powered mobile edge computing systems, offering substantial performance improvements while maintaining flexible fairness control through the alpha-fairness mechanism.

Abstract: In this paper, cooperative energy recycling (CER) is investigated in
wireless-powered mobile edge computing systems. Unlike conventional
architectures that rely solely on a dedicated power source, wireless sensors
are additionally enabled to recycle energy from peer transmissions. To evaluate
system performance, a joint computation optimization problem is formulated that
integrates local computing and computation offloading, under an alpha-fairness
objective that balances total computable data and user fairness while
satisfying energy, latency, and task size constraints. Due to the inherent
non-convexity introduced by coupled resource variables and fairness
regularization, a variable-substitution technique is employed to transform the
problem into a convex structure, which is then efficiently solved using
Lagrangian duality and alternating optimization. To characterize the
fairness-efficiency tradeoff, closed-form solutions are derived for three
representative regimes: zero fairness, common fairness, and max-min fairness,
each offering distinct system-level insights. Numerical results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed CER-enabled framework, demonstrating significant
gains in throughput and adaptability over benchmark schemes. The tunable alpha
fairness mechanism provides flexible control over performance-fairness
trade-offs across diverse scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Impulsive interference in mmWave MIMO systems, caused by hardware issues or external disruptions, poses significant challenges for channel estimation due to its sporadic and high-power nature.

Method: Developed a Bayesian channel estimation technique based on variational inference that uses mean-field approximation and integrates VI into the sparse Bayesian learning framework, exploiting mmWave channel sparsity and impulsive interference characteristics.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed technique achieves superior channel estimation accuracy compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The variational inference-based Bayesian approach effectively addresses impulsive interference in mmWave MIMO channel estimation by leveraging sparsity and intermittent interference properties.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a channel estimation problem in a downlink
millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, which
suffers from impulsive interference caused by hardware non-idealities or
external disruptions. Specifically, impulsive interference presents a
significant challenge to channel estimation due to its sporadic, unpredictable,
and high-power nature. To tackle this issue, we develop a Bayesian channel
estimation technique based on variational inference (VI) that leverages the
sparsity of the mmWave channel in the angular domain and the intermittent
nature of impulsive interference to minimize channel estimation errors. The
proposed technique employs mean-field approximation to approximate posterior
inference and integrates VI into the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are no universally accepted definitions of Rényi conditional entropy and mutual information, with multiple definitions existing in literature for different applications. The authors aim to provide a unified framework that encompasses existing definitions.

Method: The authors consider a family of two-parameter Rényi conditional entropy and mutual information. They perform a change of variables to align with existing definitions and establish fundamental properties through mathematical proofs.

Result: The paper establishes several fundamental properties including monotonicity with respect to parameters, variational expressions, non-negativity, additivity, data processing inequality, and convexity/concavity. The new two-parameter Rényi mutual information unifies three commonly used variants.

Conclusion: The two-parameter Rényi information quantities provide a comprehensive framework that characterizes strong converse exponents in privacy amplification and soft covering problems under Rényi divergence for order α ∈ (0, ∞).

Abstract: There are no universally accepted definitions of R\'enyi conditional entropy
and R\'enyi mutual information, although motivated by different applications,
several definitions have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we
consider a family of two-parameter R\'enyi conditional entropy and a family of
two-parameter R\'enyi mutual information. By performing a change of variables
for the parameters, the two-parameter R\'enyi conditional entropy we study
coincides precisely with the definition introduced by Hayashi and Tan [IEEE
Trans. Inf. Theory, 2016], and it also emerges naturally as the classical
specialization of the three-parameter quantum R\'enyi conditional entropy
recently put forward by Rubboli, Goodarzi, and Tomamichel [arXiv:2410.21976
(2024)]. We establish several fundamental properties of the two-parameter
R\'enyi conditional entropy, including monotonicity with respect to the
parameters and variational expression. The associated two-parameter R\'enyi
mutual information considered in this paper is new and it unifies three
commonly used variants of R\'enyi mutual information. For this quantity, we
prove several important properties, including the non-negativity, additivity,
data processing inequality, monotonicity with respect to the parameters,
variational expression, as well as convexity and concavity. Finally, we
demonstrate that these two-parameter R\'enyi information quantities can be used
to characterize the strong converse exponents in privacy amplification and soft
covering problems under R\'enyi divergence of order $\alpha \in (0, \infty)$.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme effectively suppresses inter-cell interference and improves system performance in multi-cell environments with spectral reuse.

Abstract: The increasing spectral reuse can cause significant performance degradation

to mitigate ICI. The proposed scheme, named Z-refined deep support vector data
description, exploits a one-class classification-based anomaly detection
technique. Numerical results verify that the proposed scheme outperforms
various baselines in terms of interference detection performance with limited

based on an ideal genie-aided interference suppression scheme. Furthermore, we
demonstrate through test equipment experiments using a commercial
fifth-generation modem chipset that the proposed scheme shows performance
improvements across various 3rd generation partnership project standard channel
environments, including tapped delay line-A, -B, and -C models.

Conclusion: Additive cyclic codes over FqFq^2 provide a framework for constructing optimal codes including linear codes over F3 and ternary LCD codes, demonstrating their practical utility in coding theory.

Abstract: We investigate additive cyclic codes over the alphabet
$\mathbb{F}_{q}\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, where $q$ is a prime power. First, its
generator polynomials and minimal spanning set are determined. Then, examples
of $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-additive cyclic codes that satisfy the well-known
Singleton bound are constructed. Using a Gray map, we produce certain optimal
linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_{3}$. Finally, we obtain a few optimal ternary
linear complementary dual (LCD) codes from
$\mathbb{F}_{3}\mathbb{F}_{9}$-additive codes.

*Razvan Gabriel Iagar,David Puertas-Centeno*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces a biparametric family of transformations extending up and down transformations, leading to new informational functionals called down-moments and cumulative upper-moments that interpolate between p-th moments and Rényi entropies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the theory of up and down transformations and develop new informational functionals that bridge classical statistical measures like moments and entropies.

Method: Introduces biparametric transformations to define down-moments and cumulative upper-moments, establishes inequalities relating these to classical measures, and defines new complexity measures as quotients of these functionals.

Result: Establishes sharp inequalities between new functionals and classical informational measures, provides optimal bounds and minimizing densities (some expressed via generalized trigonometric functions), and demonstrates monotonicity properties through algebraic conjugation.

Conclusion: The new transformations and functionals reveal an intricate structure of functional inequalities and provide interpolation between moments and Rényi entropies, with applications in statistical complexity measures.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a biparametric family of transformations which can
be seen as an extension of the so-called up and down transformations. This new
class of transformations allows to us to introduce new informational
functionals, which we have called \textit{down-moments} and \textit{cumulative
upper-moments}. A remarkable fact is that the down-moments provide, in some
cases, an interpolation between the $p$-th moments and the power R\'enyi
entropies of a probability density. We establish new and sharp inequalities
relating these new functionals to the classical informational measures such as
moments, R\'enyi and Shannon entropies and Fisher information measures. We also
give the optimal bounds as well as the minimizing densities, which are in some
cases expressed in terms of the generalized trigonometric functions. We
furthermore define new classes of measures of statistical complexity obtained
as quotients of the new functionals, and establish monotonicity properties for
them through an algebraic conjugation of up and down transformations. All of
these properties highlight an intricate structure of functional inequalities.

### [213] [Improved AntiGriesmer Bounds for Linear Anticodes and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02519)
*Guanghui Zhang,Bocong Chen,Liren Lin,Hongwei Liu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper improves the antiGriesmer bound for linear anticodes by removing length restrictions and relaxing dual distance requirements from ≥3 to ≥2, providing a more general inequality that broadens applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize and improve the antiGriesmer bound established by Chen and Xie, which had restrictive conditions on code length and dual distance, making the bound more widely applicable.

Method: Proving that for any [n,k]_q linear anticode with diameter δ and d(C^⊥) ≥ 2, the inequality n ≤ ∑_{i=0}^{k-1} ⌊δ/q^i⌋ holds, without length restrictions.

Result: Successfully established a more general antiGriesmer bound that applies to broader cases, derived corollaries on diameter bounds, code length constraints, and dimension limitations, with examples showing sharper bounds than previous results.

Conclusion: The work unifies and extends earlier findings, providing a comprehensive framework for studying linear anticodes and their properties, with applications to constructing and classifying linear codes with few weights.

Abstract: This paper improves the antiGriesmer bound for linear anticodes previously
established by Chen and Xie (Journal of Algebra, 673 (2025) 304-320). While the
original bound required the code length to satisfy $n < q^{k-1}$ and the dual
code to have minimum distance at least 3, our main result removes the length
restriction and relaxes the dual distance condition to at least 2.
Specifically, we prove that for any $[n,k]_q$ linear anticode $\mathcal{C}$
over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with diameter $\delta$ and $d(\mathcal{C}^\perp) \geq 2$,
the inequality \[ n \leq \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left\lfloor \frac{\delta}{q^i}
\right\rfloor \] holds. This generalization significantly broadens the
applicability of the antiGriesmer bound. We derive several corollaries,
including lower bounds on the diameter $\delta$ in terms of $n$ and $k$, upper
bounds on the code length $n$, and constraints on the dimension $k$.
Applications to the construction and classification of linear codes with few
weights are also discussed, along with examples demonstrating that our new
bound can be sharper than previous ones. Our work unifies and extends earlier
findings, providing a more comprehensive framework for studying linear
anticodes and their properties.

*Rui Xu,Yinghui Ye,Xiaoli Chu,Guangyue Lu,Kai-Kit Wong,Chan-Byoung Chae*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper develops a performance evaluation framework for fluid antenna systems (FAS) using extreme value distributions to model fully correlated Rayleigh fading channels, providing closed-form expressions for outage probability and ergodic capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of accurate yet tractable performance expressions for FAS under fully correlated fading due to the absence of closed-form distribution for FAS channels.

Method: Model FAS channel through extreme value distributions (Gumbel and generalized extreme value distributions) with parameters derived via maximum likelihood criterion, then derive closed-form expressions for outage probability and ergodic capacity.

Result: Both EVD-based approaches offer computationally efficient tools, with the GEV-based framework achieving superior accuracy over the Gumbel-based model, especially in extreme-probability regions.

Conclusion: The proposed EVD-based frameworks provide accurate and analytically tractable performance evaluation tools for FAS under realistic correlated fading conditions.

Abstract: In single-antenna fluid antenna systems (FASs), the transceiver dynamically
selects the antenna port with the strongest instantaneous channel to enhance
link reliability. However, deriving accurate yet tractable performance
expressions under fully correlated fading remains challenging, primarily due to
the absence of a closed-form distribution for the FAS channel. To address this
gap, this paper develops a novel performance evaluation framework for FAS
operating under fully correlated Rayleigh fading, by modeling the FAS channel
through extreme value distributions (EVDs). We first justify the suitability of
EVD modeling and approximate the FAS channel through the Gumbel distribution,
with parameters expressed as functions of the number of ports and the antenna
aperture size via the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. Closed-form
expressions for the outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC) are then
derived. While the Gumbel model provides an excellent fit, minor deviations
arise in the extreme-probability regions. To further improve accuracy, we
extend the framework using the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution and
obtain closed-form OP and EC approximations based on ML-derived parameters.
Simulation results confirm that the proposed GEV-based framework achieves
superior accuracy over the Gumbel-based model, while both EVD-based approaches
offer computationally efficient and analytically tractable tools for evaluating
the performance of FAS under realistic correlated fading conditions.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper uses Partial Information Decomposition to analyze Hopfield networks, finds high redundancy between inputs below capacity, and achieves 10x+ memory capacity improvement by optimizing redundancy as a learning goal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the local computational principles that enable associative memory in Hopfield networks, which remain incompletely understood.

Method: Applied Partial Information Decomposition (PID) framework to analyze information processing in individual neurons of Hopfield networks, then used redundancy maximization as an information-theoretic learning goal for optimization.

Result: Achieved memory capacity of 1.59, a more than tenfold improvement over classical Hopfield networks (0.14) and outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations.

Conclusion: Establishes redundancy maximization as a new design principle for associative memories and opens pathways for new associative memory models based on information-theoretic goals.

Abstract: Associative memory, traditionally modeled by Hopfield networks, enables the
retrieval of previously stored patterns from partial or noisy cues. Yet, the
local computational principles which are required to enable this function
remain incompletely understood. To formally characterize the local information
processing in such systems, we employ a recent extension of information theory
- Partial Information Decomposition (PID). PID decomposes the contribution of
different inputs to an output into unique information from each input,
redundant information across inputs, and synergistic information that emerges
from combining different inputs. Applying this framework to individual neurons
in classical Hopfield networks we find that below the memory capacity, the
information in a neuron's activity is characterized by high redundancy between
the external pattern input and the internal recurrent input, while synergy and
unique information are close to zero until the memory capacity is surpassed and
performance drops steeply. Inspired by this observation, we use redundancy as
an information-theoretic learning goal, which is directly optimized for each
neuron, dramatically increasing the network's memory capacity to 1.59, a more
than tenfold improvement over the 0.14 capacity of classical Hopfield networks
and even outperforming recent state-of-the-art implementations of Hopfield
networks. Ultimately, this work establishes redundancy maximization as a new
design principle for associative memories and opens pathways for new
associative memory models based on information-theoretic goals.

### [216] [Optimal Source Coding of Markov Chains for Real-Time Remote Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02803)
*Ismail Cosandal,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Optimal source coding for Markov chains where transmission time and state transitions occur simultaneously, minimizing average transmission duration using an MDP-based policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address source coding when transmission time and Markov chain state transitions happen at the same time-scale, where codeword length affects both transmission duration and next symbol probability.

Method: Formulate as Markov decision process (MDP) by augmenting symbols with transmission duration, propose optimal policy based on last transmitted symbol and its transmission time.

Result: Proposed optimal policy reduces average transmission duration compared to Huffman-based benchmarks, with performance gain depending on Markov process parameters.

Conclusion: MDP-based optimal source coding policy effectively minimizes transmission duration in Markov chains with simultaneous transmission and state transitions.

Abstract: We revisit the source coding problem for a Markov chain under the assumption
that the transmission times and how fast the Markov chain transitions its state
happen at the same time-scale. Specifically, we assume that the transmission of
each bit takes a single time slot, and the Markov chain updates its state in
the same time slot. Thus, the length of the codeword assigned to a symbol
determines the number of non-transmitted symbols, as well as, the probability
of the realization of the next symbol to be transmitted. We aim to minimize the
average transmission duration over an infinite horizon by proposing an optimal
source coding policy based on the last transmitted symbol and its transmission
duration. To find the optimal policy, we formulate the problem with a Markov
decision process (MDP) by augmenting the symbols alongside the transmission
duration of the symbols. Finally, we analyze two Huffman-based benchmark
policies and compare their performances with the proposed optimal policy. We
observe that, in randomly generated processes, our proposed optimal policy
decreases the average transmission duration compared to benchmark policies. The
performance gain varies based on the parameters of the Markov process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop quasi-cyclic codes for quantum error-correcting codes, leveraging their self-orthogonal properties under Euclidean and Hermitian inner products.

Method: Propose construction of infinite families of quasi-cyclic codes using constituent codes over field extensions, compute dimension and minimum distance bounds, and apply CSS construction.

Result: Lower bound for minimum distance satisfies square-root-like bound, self-dual quasi-cyclic codes can be derived, and quantum error-correcting codes with good parameters are obtained.

Conclusion: The construction provides effective quasi-cyclic codes for quantum error correction, demonstrating practical utility through the CSS framework.

Abstract: Quasi-cyclic codes have been recently employed in the constructions of
quantum error-correcting codes. In this paper, we propose a construction of
infinite families of quasi-cyclic codes which are self-orthogonal with respect
to the Euclidean and Hermitian inner products. In particular, their dimension
and a lower bound for their minimum distance are computed using their
constituent codes defined over field extensions of $\mathbb{F}_q$. We also show
that the lower bound for the minimum distance satisfies the square-root-like
lower bound and also show how self-dual quasi-cyclic codes can arise from our
construction. Using the CSS construction, we show the existence of quantum
error-correcting codes with good parameters.

*Zhengdong Hu,Chong Han,Wolfgang Gerstacker,Robert Schober*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: DiffPace is a diffusion-based plug-and-play method for channel estimation in mmWave/THz UM-MIMO systems that achieves high accuracy with 90% fewer inference steps than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of accurate channel estimation in mmWave and THz UM-MIMO systems, which suffer from high channel dimensionality, compressed observations, and hybrid near-far-field radiation patterns that conventional compressive sensing methods cannot effectively capture.

Method: Uses a diffusion model to capture channel distribution based on the hybrid spherical and planar-wave model, applying plug-and-play approach to leverage DM as prior knowledge, and performs inference by solving ordinary differential equations to minimize required steps.

Result: Achieves -15 dB normalized mean square error at 10 dB SNR with 90% fewer inference steps compared to state-of-the-art schemes, providing both high estimation precision and enhanced computational efficiency.

Conclusion: DiffPace offers an effective solution for channel estimation in mmWave/THz UM-MIMO systems by combining diffusion models with plug-and-play approach, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced computational complexity.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz)-band communications hold great
promise in meeting the growing data-rate demands of next-generation wireless
networks, offering abundant bandwidth. To mitigate the severe path loss
inherent to these high frequencies and reduce hardware costs, ultra-massive
multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems with hybrid beamforming
architectures can deliver substantial beamforming gains and enhanced spectral
efficiency. However, accurate channel estimation (CE) in mmWave and THz UM-MIMO
systems is challenging due to high channel dimensionality and compressed
observations from a limited number of RF chains, while the hybrid near- and
far-field radiation patterns, arising from large array apertures and high
carrier frequencies, further complicate CE. Conventional compressive sensing
based frameworks rely on predefined sparsifying matrices, which cannot
faithfully capture the hybrid near-field and far-field channel structures,
leading to degraded estimation performance. This paper introduces DiffPace, a
diffusion-based plug-and-play method for channel estimation. DiffPace uses a
diffusion model (DM) to capture the channel distribution based on the hybrid
spherical and planar-wave (HPSM) model. By applying the plug-and-play approach,
it leverages the DM as prior knowledge, improving CE accuracy. Moreover, DM
performs inference by solving an ordinary differential equation, minimizing the
number of required inference steps compared with stochastic sampling method.
Experimental results show that DiffPace achieves competitive CE performance,
attaining -15 dB normalized mean square error (NMSE) at a signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of 10 dB, with 90\% fewer inference steps compared to state-of-the-art
schemes, simultaneously providing high estimation precision and enhanced
computational efficiency.

*Tingting Huang,Jundong Chen,Huanqiang Zeng,Guofa Cai,Haoyu Zhou*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A novel CSK system using combined chaotic sequences eliminates chaotic synchronization needs and employs deep learning for symbol recovery, showing superior performance in noisy and fading channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CSK systems require costly chaotic synchronization that's impractical in noisy environments, creating a need for synchronization-free alternatives.

Method: Combines two chaotic segments from different systems at transmitter, uses only one segment for modulation, and implements deep learning binary classification at receiver for symbol recovery.

Result: Achieves better SER performance over AWGN and multipath Rayleigh fading channels, with significant advantages over existing CSK systems in fading conditions.

Conclusion: CCS-M-CSK is a promising synchronization-free solution suitable for applications like V2X communications due to its robust performance in challenging channel conditions.

Abstract: In traditional chaos shift keying (CSK) communication systems, implementing
chaotic synchronization techniques is costly but practically unattainable in a
noisy environment. This paper proposes a combined chaotic sequences-based
$M$-ary CSK (CCS-$M$-CSK) system that eliminates the need for chaotic
synchronization. At the transmitter, the chaotic sequence is constructed by
combining two chaotic segments of different lengths, where each is generated
from distinct chaotic systems and only one kind of chaotic segment modulates
the information signal. At the receiver, a deep learning unit with binary
classification is meticulously designed to recover information symbols. The
symbol error rate (SER) performance of the proposed system is evaluated over
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading channels.
Specifically, the impact of varying misalignment lengths on the SER performance
of the system is analyzed when the received sequence is misaligned.
Furthermore, the proposed system demonstrates significant performance
advantages over existing CSK-based systems in multipath Rayleigh fading
channels. These features establish CCS-$M$-CSK as a promising candidate for
various applications, including Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X).

### [221] [A Comparison of Road Grade Preview Signals from Lidar and Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02006)
*Logan Schexnaydre,Aman Poovalappil,Darrell Robinette,Jeremy Bos*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper presents a lidar-based real-time road grade estimation system that provides accurate grade measurements comparable to map-based systems, enabling better autonomous vehicle control without relying on pre-made maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current road grade compensation systems either rely on proprioceptive measurements (no preview) or pre-made maps (potentially outdated/missing data), both limiting control system performance. Real-time lidar-based estimation can overcome these limitations.

Method: Uses on-board lidar point returns accumulated during travel to estimate grade at each waypoint by calculating height difference between front and rear wheelbase. Applies Kalman filtering to mitigate odometry and motion uncertainty effects.

Result: Lidar-based estimator produces unbiased error with 0.6 degrees standard deviation at 52.7 meters average range, showing similar precision to GNSS/INS map-based systems.

Conclusion: Lidar-based grade estimation is a valid alternative to map-based systems, providing autonomous vehicles with higher redundancy and independence for grade-based control tasks when maps are unavailable or inaccurate.

Abstract: Road grade can impact the energy efficiency, safety, and comfort associated
with automated vehicle control systems. Currently, control systems that attempt
to compensate for road grade are designed with one of two assumptions. Either
the grade is only known once the vehicle is driving over the road segment
through proprioception, or complete knowledge of the oncoming road grade is
known from a pre-made map. Both assumptions limit the performance of a control
system, as not having a preview signal prevents proactive grade compensation,
whereas relying only on map data potentially subjects the control system to
missing or outdated information. These limits can be avoided by measuring the
oncoming grade in real-time using on-board lidar sensors. In this work, we use
point returns accumulated during travel to estimate the grade at each waypoint
along a path. The estimated grade is defined as the difference in height
between the front and rear wheelbase at a given waypoint. Kalman filtering
techniques are used to mitigate the effects of odometry and motion uncertainty
on the grade estimates. This estimator's performance is compared to the
measurements of a map created with a GNSS/INS system via a field experiment.
When compared to the map-based system, the lidar-based estimator produces an
unbiased error with a standard deviation of 0.6 degrees at an average range of
52.7 meters. By having similar precision to map-based systems, automotive
lidar-based grade estimation systems are shown to be a valid approach for
measuring road grade when a map is unavailable or inaccurate. In using lidar as
an input signal for grade-based control system tasks, autonomous vehicles
achieve higher redundancy and independence in contrast to existing methods.

Motivation: Traditional routing methods fail to address the complexity of heterogeneous wireless networks with multiple communication technologies, frequency-dependent fading, and dynamic topology changes.

Method: Deep reinforcement learning framework using deep Q-networks (DQN) that enables each node to jointly select communication technology, subband, and next hop relay, incorporating channel and interference-aware neighbor selection.

Result: The DRL-based routing framework significantly enhances scalability, adaptability, and end-to-end throughput in complex HWN scenarios under varying network dynamics.

Conclusion: The proposed DRL-based approach effectively addresses the limitations of traditional routing methods in heterogeneous wireless networks by providing adaptive and efficient multi-hop routing with multiple data flows.

Abstract: Due to the rapid growth of heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs), where
devices with diverse communication technologies coexist, there is increasing
demand for efficient and adaptive multi-hop routing with multiple data flows.
Traditional routing methods, designed for homogeneous environments, fail to
address the complexity introduced by links consisting of multiple technologies,
frequency-dependent fading, and dynamic topology changes. In this paper, we
propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based routing framework using deep
Q-networks (DQN) to establish routes between multiple source-destination pairs
in HWNs by enabling each node to jointly select a communication technology, a
subband, and a next hop relay that maximizes the rate of the route. Our
approach incorporates channel and interference-aware neighbor selection
approaches to improve decision-making beyond conventional distance-based
heuristics. We further evaluate the robustness and generalizability of the
proposed method under varying network dynamics, including node mobility,
changes in node density, and the number of data flows. Simulation results
demonstrate that our DRL-based routing framework significantly enhances
scalability, adaptability, and end-to-end throughput in complex HWN scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional relays struggle to protect transmission lines connected to converter-based energy sources due to power electronics' influence on fault characteristics, requiring more intelligent protection schemes.

Method: Uses Recurrence Matrix and InceptionTime system with mean change in quantiles of 3-phase currents, ReliefF feature selection for optimal quantile features, and integrates semi-supervised learning (label spreading, propagation, self-training) to handle limited labeled data.

Result: Effective protection under various conditions including different fault types, system configurations, noise, CT saturation, and varying PV capacity. Achieves near-supervised performance with limited annotated data through semi-supervised learning.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully protects transmission lines connected to large PV plants across different system configurations and challenging conditions, addressing the limitations of conventional relays.

Abstract: Conventional relays encounter difficulties in protecting transmission lines
(TLs) connected to converter-based energy sources (CBESs) due to the influence
of power electronics on fault characteristics. This article proposes a
single-ended intelligent protection method for the TL segment between the grid
and a Photovoltaic (PV) plant. The approach utilizes a Recurrence Matrix and an
InceptionTime-based system to identify faults by using the mean change in
quantiles of 3-phase currents. It determines the fault position and identifies
the faulty phase. ReliefF feature selection is applied to extract the optimal
quantile features. The scheme's performance is assessed under abnormal
conditions, including faults and capacitor and load-switching events, simulated
in Power Systems Computer Aided Design / Electromagnetic Transients Program
(PSCAD/EMTDC) on the Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) 9-bus system,
with various fault and switching parameters. The scheme is also validated on
the New England IEEE 39-bus system and in presence of partially rated
converters. Additionally, the validation of the proposed strategy takes into
account various conditions, including double-circuit line configuration, noise,
series compensation, high-impedance faults, current transformer (CT)
saturation, evolving and cross-country faults, remote and local faults, as well
as variations in PV capacity, sampling frequency, and data window size. To
address label scarcity and improve generalization, semi-supervised learning
paradigms including label spreading, label propagation, and self-training are
integrated with the InceptionTime framework, enabling near-supervised
performance with limited annotated fault data. The results demonstrate that the
approach is effective in handling different system configurations and
conditions, ensuring the protection of TLs connected to large PV plants.

absorbance spectra measured at a receiver. Our model is trained by both
experimental and simulated datasets, with the latter enhanced by noise modeling
to mimic real-world measurements. We demonstrate that a noiseaugmented
simulated dataset can effectively be a substitute for experimental data,
achieving similar decoding accuracy. Our approach successfully detects bit
sequences in both binary and quadruple concentration shift keying (BCSK and
QCSK) scenarios, even when transmitters are desynchronized, highlighting the
potential of machine learning for robust MC signal detection.

*Ailton Oliveira,Amir Khatibi,Daniel Suzuki,Ilan Correa,José Rezende,Aldebaro Klautau*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Deep learning-based beam tracking framework using position-aware pre-selection and RNNs for robust millimeter wave communications in dynamic scenarios including challenging NLOS conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millimeter wave communications suffer from severe path loss requiring precise beam alignment, which is particularly challenging in dynamic scenarios like vehicle-to-infrastructure. Existing methods often focus on LOS conditions, lacking robustness in NLOS scenarios.

Method: Proposed a deep learning-based beam tracking framework combining position-aware beam pre-selection with sequential prediction using recurrent neural networks, supporting both classification and regression models. Explicitly tested in challenging NLOS scenarios (up to 50% NLOS incidence).

Result: Maintains high top-K accuracy under adverse conditions while reducing beam measurement overhead by up to 50%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates robust beam tracking performance in challenging NLOS scenarios while significantly reducing measurement overhead, making it suitable for dynamic millimeter wave communication environments.

Abstract: Millimeter wave communications are essential for modern wireless networks. It
supports high data rates but suffers from severe path loss, which requires
precise beam alignment to maintain reliable links. This beam management is
particularly challenging in highly dynamic scenarios such as
vehicle-to-infrastructure, and several methods have been presented. In this
work, we propose a deep learning-based beam tracking framework that combines a
position-aware beam pre-selection strategy with sequential prediction using
recurrent neural networks. The proposed architecture can support deep learning
models trained for both classification and regression. In contrast to many
existing studies that evaluate beam tracking under predominantly line-of-sight
(LOS) conditions, our work explicitly includes highly challenging non-LOS
scenarios - with up to 50% non-LOS incidence in certain datasets - to
rigorously assess model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach maintains high top-K accuracy, even under adverse conditions, while
reducing the beam measurement overhead by up to 50%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for accurate pathloss map generation in 6G communication systems by exploring the mapping between sensing images and pathloss maps through cross-modal learning.

Conclusion: LLM4PG demonstrates superior performance in pathloss map generation and strong generalization capabilities, making it promising for 6G AI-native communication systems.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel large language model (LLM)-based pathloss map
generation model, termed LLM4PG, is proposed for sixth-generation (6G)
AI-native communication systems via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). To explore
the mapping mechanism between sensing images and pathloss maps, a new synthetic
intelligent multi-modal sensing-communication dataset, SynthSoM-U2G, is
constructed, covering multiple scenarios, frequency bands, and flight
altitudes. By adapting the LLM for cross-modal pathloss map generation for the
first time, LLM4PG establishes an effective cross-domain alignment between the
multi-modal sensing-communication and natural language domains. A task-specific
fine-tuning strategy with a tailored layer selection and activation scheme is
designed to meet the demands of massive-scale, high-quality generation.
Compared with conventional deep learning artificial intelligence generated
content (AIGC) models, LLM4PG achieves more accurate pathloss map generation
and stronger generalization across diverse conditions. Results show that LLM4PG
attains an NMSE of 0.0454, outperforming the conventional AIGC model by over
2.90 dB, while its cross-condition generalization achieves an NMSE of 0.0492,
exceeding the baseline by 4.52 dB.

*Marios Impraimakis*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A Kullback-Leibler divergence method is used within Kalman filter framework to select the most plausible input-parameter-state estimation by comparing posterior distributions to prior distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty in obtaining different results from different initial parameter set guesses in system identification, and use information gained from data to select the most plausible estimation.

Method: 1) Perform Kalman filter for multiple initial parameter sets; 2) Compare posterior distributions to prior distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence; 3) Select identification with least divergence as most plausible.

Result: The method successfully selects the better performed identification in linear, nonlinear, and limited information applications.

Conclusion: The approach provides a powerful tool for system monitoring by reliably identifying the most plausible estimation results.

Abstract: The capability of a novel Kullback-Leibler divergence method is examined
herein within the Kalman filter framework to select the input-parameter-state
estimation execution with the most plausible results. This identification
suffers from the uncertainty related to obtaining different results from
different initial parameter set guesses, and the examined approach uses the
information gained from the data in going from the prior to the posterior
distribution to address the issue. Firstly, the Kalman filter is performed for
a number of different initial parameter sets providing the system
input-parameter-state estimation. Secondly, the resulting posterior
distributions are compared simultaneously to the initial prior distributions
using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Finally, the identification with the
least Kullback-Leibler divergence is selected as the one with the most
plausible results. Importantly, the method is shown to select the better
performed identification in linear, nonlinear, and limited information
applications, providing a powerful tool for system monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more power-efficient asynchronous sampler that reduces both sampling rate and bit usage by combining the advantages of adaptive and compressed IF-TEM approaches.

Method: Proposed Adaptive Compressed IF-TEM (ACIF-TEM) that integrates compression within a clockless time-to-digital converter, combining adaptive signal processing with analog compression before quantization.

Result: ACIF-TEM achieves compression gains of at least 3-bit out of 9-bits over AIF-TEM and 60% compression over IF-TEM for fixed recovery MSE with real audio signals, demonstrating lower MSE with fewer bits.

Conclusion: The combined ACIF-TEM sampler successfully leverages both adaptive and compression techniques, where each reinforces the other's effectiveness, resulting in superior performance compared to individual IF-TEM variants.

Abstract: Integrate-and-Fire Time Encoding Machine (IF-TEM) is a power-efficient
asynchronous sampler that converts analog signals into non-uniform time-domain
samples. Adaptive IF-TEM (AIF-TEM) improves this machine by adapting its

analog compression before quantization. In this paper, we introduce a combined
Adaptive Compressed IF-TEM (ACIF-TEM) -- a new sampler that leverages the two
machines, AIF-TEM and CIF-TEM, where each reinforces the effectiveness of the
other. We propose an efficient adaptive clockless time-to-digital converter
(TDC) architecture for the novel sampler that integrates the compression stage
within the TDC, facilitating the realization of the intended integrated system.
\ifconf \else We analyze the total bit usage, and contrast its performance with

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate brain connectivity and information flow during mental workload by integrating EEG and fNIRS signals to understand neurovascular coupling mechanisms.

Method: Used N-back task with 26 participants, analyzed functional connectivity (PCC, PLV, MSC) and effective connectivity (dDTF, gPDC) across 25 cortical regions from combined EEG-fNIRS signals.

Result: Increased functional connectivity in frontal regions during high MWL; significant directional information flow from EEG to fNIRS; statistical confirmation of connectivity differences between low and high MWL states.

Conclusion: EEG-fNIRS integration effectively characterizes brain network dynamics under cognitive demands and provides insights into neurovascular coupling during mental workload.

Abstract: This study investigates brain connectivity and information flow during mental
workload (MWL) by integrating electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals. Utilizing the N-back task to induce
varying levels of MWL in 26 participants, we analyzed both functional and
effective connectivity across 25 cortical regions derived from combined EEG and
fNIRS signals. Functional connectivity was assessed using Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC), Phase Locking Value (PLV), and Magnitude Squared Coherence
(MSC), while effective connectivity was evaluated using directed Directed
Transfer Function (dDTF) and generalized Partial Directed Coherence (gPDC). Our
findings reveal increased functional connectivity in frontal regions during
higher MWL conditions (3-back compared to 0-back). Furthermore, effective
connectivity analysis demonstrates a significant directional information flow
from EEG to fNIRS, indicating a dominant influence of neural activity on
hemodynamic responses. Statistical tests confirm significant differences in
connectivity patterns between low and high MWL states. These results underscore
the utility of EEG-fNIRS integration for characterizing brain network dynamics
under varying cognitive demands and provide insights into neurovascular
coupling mechanisms during mental workload.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of optical sensing (occlusion, low light) by using RF waves that penetrate materials and encode geometric/compositional information, enhanced by controllable propagation through RIS.

Method: Combines RIS-enabled field synthesis with Detection Transformer (DETR) that infers spatial and material parameters from RF features using material-aware spherical primitives.

Result: Achieved 79.35% overall accuracy in approximating object geometries and classifying material composition in simulations.

Conclusion: This marks an initial step toward programmable and physically grounded RF-based 3D object composition visualization.

Abstract: The pursuit of immersive and structurally aware multimedia experiences has
intensified interest in sensing modalities that reconstruct objects beyond the
limits of visible light. Conventional optical pipelines degrade under occlusion
or low illumination, motivating the use of radio-frequency (RF) sensing, whose
electromagnetic waves penetrate materials and encode both geometric and
compositional information. Yet, uncontrolled multipath propagation restricts
reconstruction accuracy. Recent advances in Programmable Wireless Environments
(PWEs) mitigate this limitation by enabling software-defined manipulation of
propagation through Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), thereby
providing controllable illumination diversity. Building on this capability,
this work introduces a PWE-driven RF framework for three-dimensional object
reconstruction using material-aware spherical primitives. The proposed approach
combines RIS-enabled field synthesis with a Detection Transformer (DETR) that
infers spatial and material parameters directly from extracted RF features.
Simulation results confirm the framework's ability to approximate object
geometries and classify material composition with an overall accuracy of
79.35%, marking an initial step toward programmable and physically grounded
RF-based 3D object composition visualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve radar sensing performance in integrated sensing and communication systems operating in unknown and dynamic disturbance environments, addressing the challenge of non-Gaussian clutter and the need for adaptive target detection without prior environmental knowledge.

Method: Combines a Wald-type detector for robust target detection under non-Gaussian clutter with a SARSA-based RL algorithm for adaptive target position estimation, followed by joint waveform optimization to balance radar sensing accuracy and communication throughput.

Result: Monte Carlo simulations show significantly improved detection probability compared to orthogonal and non-learning adaptive baselines, while maintaining competitive communication performance through an analytically derived closed-form solution.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-assisted cognitive framework demonstrates potential for robust and spectrum-efficient integrated sensing and communication in next-generation wireless networks, achieving adaptive trade-offs between detection performance and communication sum rate.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-aided cognitive framework
for massive MIMO-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems
employing a uniform planar array (UPA). The focus is on enhancing radar sensing
performance in environments with unknown and dynamic disturbance
characteristics. A Wald-type detector is employed for robust target detection
under non-Gaussian clutter, while a SARSA-based RL algorithm enables adaptive
estimation of target positions without prior environmental knowledge. Based on
the RL-derived sensing information, a joint waveform optimization strategy is
formulated to balance radar sensing accuracy and downlink communication
throughput. The resulting design provides an adaptive trade-off between
detection performance and achievable sum rate through an analytically derived
closed-form solution. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed
cognitive ISAC framework achieves significantly improved detection probability
compared to orthogonal and non-learning adaptive baselines, while maintaining
competitive communication performance. These results underline the potential of

*Adam Umra,Kevin Weinberger,Aymen Khaleel,Aydin Sezgin*

TL;DR: This paper studies RIS-assisted full-duplex ISAC systems addressing self-interference and finite blocklength constraints, developing an optimization framework to balance communication throughput and sensing reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical ISAC realization faces challenges with residual self-interference in full-duplex systems and performance degradation of short-packet transmissions under finite blocklength constraints, requiring solutions for simultaneous connectivity and environmental awareness in 6G networks.

Method: Developed an optimization framework using alternating optimization and successive convex approximation to minimize service adaptation gaps while ensuring sensing reliability in RIS-assisted full-duplex ISAC systems serving multiple downlink users while tracking moving targets.

Result: Found that short blocklengths enable fast adaptation but increase radar outage due to fewer pulses and motion sensitivity, while longer blocklengths improve SINR but allow motion to degrade sensing. Identified a 'sweet spot' where blocklength and beamformer allocation optimize throughput and sensing.

Conclusion: RIS-assisted optimization successfully identifies the optimal balance between communication and sensing performance, achieving reliable joint communication and radar sensing by finding the local minimum in radar SINR variance.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a cornerstone for future
sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling simultaneous connectivity and
environmental awareness. However, practical realization faces significant
challenges, including residual self-interference (SI) in full-duplex systems
and performance degradation of short-packet transmissions under finite
blocklength (FBL) constraints. This work studies a reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS)-assisted full-duplex ISAC system serving multiple downlink users
while tracking a moving target, explicitly accounting for SI and FBL effects in
both communication and sensing. We formulate an optimization framework to
minimize service adaptation gaps while ensuring sensing reliability, solved via
alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Numerical results
show that short blocklengths enable fast adaptation but raise radar outage from
fewer pulses and motion sensitivity. Longer blocklengths improve
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and reduce outages but allow
motion to degrade sensing. A "sweet spot" arises where blocklength and
beamformer allocation optimize throughput and sensing, seen as a local minimum
in radar SINR variance. RIS-assisted optimization identifies this balance,
achieving reliable communication and radar sensing jointly.

*Smilja Stokanović,Jaka Sodnik,Nadica Miljković*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This study analyzes eye movement behavior during simulated driving under normal and reduced visibility conditions, finding significant differences in gaze stability and blinking behavior between baseline and driving conditions, with reduced visibility particularly affecting BCEA and blink features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how visual attention and gaze stability are affected by different driving conditions, especially reduced visibility, by analyzing comprehensive eye movement parameters.

Method: Used eye tracking data with 31 parameters organized into three groups: saccade features (13), BCEA (13), and blinking features (5). Compared three conditions: Baseline, Ride (normal visibility), and Fog (reduced visibility). Introduced Guzik's Index (GI) to quantify fixation asymmetry.

Result: Significant differences found between Baseline and driving conditions. Between Ride and Fog, saccade features showed minimal changes (1/13), while BCEA (9/13) and blink features (4/5) exhibited pronounced differences. Reduced visibility caused largest deviations in number of saccades (Cliff's δ = 0.96), BCEA (Cohen's d = 0.89), and blink duration SD (Cliff's δ = 0.80).

Conclusion: Combining BCEA with saccade and blink parameters provides comprehensive understanding of visual attention and gaze stability. GI offers additional insights into fixation asymmetry under varying visibility conditions, highlighting the strong impact of reduced visibility on gaze stability and blinking behavior.

Abstract: This study investigates eye movement behaviour during three conditions:
Baseline, Ride (simulated drive under normal visibility), and Fog (simulated
drive under reduced visibility). Eye tracking data are analyzed using 31
parameters, organized into three groups: (1) saccade features, (2) Bivariate
Contour Ellipse Area (BCEA), and (3) blinking features. Specifically, the
analysis includes 13 saccade, 13 BCEA, and 5 blinking variables. Across all
feature groups, numerous statistically significant differences emerge between
Baseline and the driving conditions, particularly between Baseline and Ride or
Fog. Between Ride and Fog, saccade features show minimal changes (one out of
13), whereas BCEA (9 of 13) and blink features (four of 5) exhibit pronounced
differences, highlighting the strong impact of reduced visibility on gaze
stability and blinking behaviour. In addition to conventional measures such as
Mean Squared Error (MSE) and entropy metrics, a new parameter, Guzik's Index
(GI), is introduced to quantify fixation asymmetry along the major axis of the
BCEA. This index utilizes eye tracking data to enhance the understanding of eye
movement dynamics during driving conditions. Separately from GI, other
parameters elicit the largest deviations compared to Ride (e.g., number of
saccades: Cliff's $\delta$ = 0.96, BCEA: Cohen's $\textit{d}$ = 0.89, and
standard deviation of blink duration: Cliff's $\delta$ = 0.80), underscoring
the influence of reduced visibility on visual attention. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that combining BCEA with saccade and blink parameters
provides a comprehensive understanding of visual attention and gaze stability,
while GI offers additional insights into fixation asymmetry under varying
visibility conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve system understanding compared to classical output-only parameter identification strategies by enabling joint real-time estimation of all dynamic states, parameters, and inputs.

Method: Two-stage unscented Kalman filter: first stage uses predicted states and parameters to estimate input, second stage uses measurement-corrected states and parameters for final estimation. Perturbation analysis shows systems with known inputs can be uniquely identified.

Result: The method successfully estimates unknown inputs, dynamic states, and parameters jointly in real-time for both linear and nonlinear systems.

Conclusion: This output-only methodology provides superior system understanding compared to classical approaches by enabling comprehensive joint estimation of states, parameters, and inputs in real-time.

Abstract: The input-parameter-state estimation capabilities of a novel unscented Kalman
filter is examined herein on both linear and nonlinear systems. The unknown
input is estimated in two stages within each time step. Firstly, the predicted
dynamic states and the system parameters provide an estimation of the input.
Secondly, the corrected with measurements states and parameters provide a final
estimation. Importantly, it is demonstrated using the perturbation analysis
that, a system with at least a zero or a non-zero known input can potentially
be uniquely identified. This output-only methodology allows for a better
understanding of the system compared to classical output-only parameter
identification strategies, given that all the dynamic states, the parameters,
and the input are estimated jointly and in real-time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work used uniform quantization for TEM firing intervals, but these intervals are inherently non-uniformly distributed, suggesting that non-uniform quantization could be more efficient.

Method: Derived probability distribution of firing intervals for bandlimited signals, designed power-law-based non-uniform quantization scheme tailored to this distribution, and compared with uniform quantization and non-uniform sampling.

Result: NUQ significantly outperforms UQ under same bit budget. TEM-NUQ achieves lower error at half the transmission cost compared to NUS.

Conclusion: Distribution-aware quantization provides advantages, establishing TEM-NUQ as an efficient alternative to conventional UQ and NUS schemes.

Abstract: Time encoding machines (TEMs) provide an event-driven alternative to
classical uniform sampling, enabling power-efficient representations without a
global clock. While prior work analyzed uniform quantization (UQ) of firing
intervals, we show that these intervals are inherently non-uniformly
distributed, motivating the use of non-uniform quantization (NUQ). We derive
the probability distribution of firing intervals for a class of bandlimited
signals and design a power-law-based NUQ scheme tailored to this distribution.
Simulations demonstrate that NUQ significantly outperforms UQ under the same
bit budget. We also compare TEMs with non-uniform sampling (NUS), where both
amplitudes and timings require quantization, and show that TEM--NUQ achieves
lower error at half the transmission cost. These results highlight the
advantages of distribution-aware quantization and establish TEM--NUQ as an
efficient alternative to conventional UQ and NUS schemes.
