Vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^k$ are encoded into codewords of a linear $[n,k,d]$ code $C$ over $\\mathbb{R}$. For prescribed positive reals $\u03b4< \u0394$, additive errors of magnitude at most $\u03b4$ are tolerable and need no handling, yet outlying errors of magnitude greater than $\u0394$ are to be located or detected. The trade-off between the ratio $\u0394/\u03b4$ and the number of outlying errors that can be handled is determined by the height profile of $C$; as such, the height profile provides a finer description of the error handling capability of $C$, compared to the minimum distance $d$, which only determines the number of correctable errors. This work contains a further study of the notion of the height profile. Several characterizations of the height profile are presented, thereby yielding methods for computing it. The starting point is formulating this computation as an optimization problem that is solved by a set of linear programs. This, in turn, leads to a combinatorial characterization of the height profile as a maximum (or max--min) over a certain finite set of codewords of $C$.

In contrast to the mostly studied belief propagation-type model-driven methods, which incur high computational complexity, Soft Interference Cancellation (SIC) strikes a good balance between performance and complexity. To further address CSI mismatch and nonlinear effects, the recently proposed data-driven deep neural receivers, such as DeepSIC, leverage the advantages of deep neural networks for interference cancellation and symbol detection, demonstrating strong empirical performance. However, there is still a lack of theoretical underpinning for why and to what extent DeepSIC could generalize with the number of training samples. This paper proposes inspecting the fully data-driven DeepSIC detection within a Network-of-MLPs architecture, which is composed of multiple interconnected MLPs via outer and inner Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Within such an architecture, DeepSIC can be upgraded as a graph-based message-passing process using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), termed GNNSIC, with shared model parameters across users and iterations. Notably, GNNSIC achieves excellent expressivity comparable to DeepSIC with substantially fewer trainable parameters, resulting in improved sample efficiency and enhanced user generalization. By conducting a norm-based generalization analysis using Rademacher complexity, we reveal that an exponential dependence on the number of iterations for DeepSIC can be eliminated in GNNSIC due to parameter sharing.

Under the control of a central processing unit (CPU), multiple access points (APs) collaboratively perform multistatic sensing while providing communication service in a cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Achieving high sensing accuracy requires the collection of global sensing information at the CPU, which can lead to significant fronthaul signaling overhead due to the feedback of the sensing signals from each AP. To tackle this issue, we propose a collaborative processing scheme in which the APs locally compress and quantize the received sensing signals before forwarding them to the CPU. The CPU then aggregates the information from all APs to estimate the location and velocity of the targets. We develop a distributed vector-quantized variational autoencoder (D-VQVAE) to enable an end-to-end implementation of this scheme. D-VQVAE consists of distributed encoders at the APs to locally encode the received sensing signals, codebooks for quantizing the encoded results, and a decoder at the CPU for location and velocity estimation. It effectively reduces the amount of data transmitted from each AP to the CPU while maintaining a high sensing accuracy. We employ a collaborative learning-assisted scheme to train D-VQVAE in an end-to-end manner.

To address this challenge, this paper investigates a wireless-fed pinching-antenna architecture that employs highly directional horn antennas to enable efficient coverage extension. Specifically, a full-duplex amplify-and-forward relay equipped with horn antennas is introduced between the base station and the waveguide input, which significantly improves the link budget in high-frequency bands while effectively eliminating self-interference.

This model completely separates between the predictive and algorithmic components, thus offering a single well-defined analysis framework that relies solely on the considered problem.

The goal is to develop OAG algorithms that admit good competitiveness when $\u03b2= 0$ (a.k.a. consistency) as well as when $\u03b2= 1$ (a.k.a. robustness); the appealing notion of smoothness, that in most prior work required a dedicated loss function, now arises naturally as $\u03b2$ shifts from $0$ to $1$.\n  We then describe a systematic method, called the drop or trust blindly (DTB) compiler, which transforms any online algorithm into a learning-augmented online algorithm in the OAG model.

One fundamental challenge in this area involves accurately parsing hands and active objects. While transformer-based architectures have demonstrated considerable potential for such tasks, several key limitations remain unaddressed: 1) existing query initialization mechanisms rely primarily on semantic cues or learnable parameters, demonstrating limited adaptability to changing active objects across varying input scenes; 2) previous transformer-based methods utilize pixel-level semantic features to iteratively refine queries during mask generation, which may introduce interaction-irrelevant content into the final embeddings; and 3) prevailing models are susceptible to \"interaction illusion\", producing physically inconsistent predictions. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Interaction-aware Transformer (InterFormer), which integrates three key components, i.e., a Dynamic Query Generator (DQG), a Dual-context Feature Selector (DFS), and the Conditional Co-occurrence (CoCo) loss. The DQG explicitly grounds query initialization in the spatial dynamics of hand-object contact, enabling targeted generation of interaction-aware queries for hands and various active objects. The DFS fuses coarse interactive cues with semantic features, thereby suppressing interaction-irrelevant noise and emphasizing the learning of interactive relationships. The CoCo loss incorporates hand-object relationship constraints to enhance physical consistency in prediction.

In response, a common proactive defense leverages fragile watermarks to detect, localize, or even recover manipulated regions. However, these methods always assume an adversary unaware of the embedded watermark, overlooking their inherent vulnerability to watermark removal attacks. Furthermore, this fragility is exacerbated in the commonly used dual-watermark strategy that adds a robust watermark for image ownership verification, where mutual interference and limited embedding capacity reduce the fragile watermark's effectiveness. To address the gap, we propose RecoverMark, a watermarking framework that achieves robust manipulation localization, content recovery, and ownership verification simultaneously. Our key insight is twofold. First, we exploit a critical real-world constraint: an adversary must preserve the background's semantic consistency to avoid visual detection, even if they apply global, imperceptible watermark removal attacks. Second, using the image's own content (face, in this paper) as the watermark enhances extraction robustness. Based on these insights, RecoverMark treats the protected face content itself as the watermark and embeds it into the surrounding background. By designing a robust two-stage training paradigm with carefully crafted distortion layers that simulate comprehensive potential attacks and a progressive training strategy, RecoverMark achieves a robust watermark embedding in no fragile manner for image manipulation localization, recovery, and image IP protection simultaneously.

Considering the widespread technique of Shapley values, we find that purely data-driven operationalization of multivariate feature importance is unsuitable for such purposes. Even for simple problems with two features, spurious associations due to collider bias and suppression arise from considering one feature only in the observational context of the other, which can lead to misinterpretations. Causal knowledge about the data-generating process is required to identify and correct such misleading feature attributions.

Such tight entanglement induces the challenging issues of insufficient utilization and overfitting to uniform training data. To mitigate this, we propose an online object-scene-camera decomposition and recomposition data manipulation scheme to more efficiently exploit the training data. We first fully decompose training images into textured 3D object point models and background scenes in an efficient computation and storage manner. We then continuously recompose new training images in each epoch by inserting the 3D objects into the freespace of the background scenes, and rendering them with perturbed camera poses from textured 3D point representation.

For instance, a missing diagnosis code in an EHR could signify either that the patient has not been diagnosed with the condition or that a diagnosis was made, but not shared by a provider. Such situations fall into the paradigm of unknown unknowns. To address this challenge, we develop a general purpose algorithm for denoising data to recover unknown missing values in binary EHRs.

Pruning techniques affirmed themselves as valid tools to extract sparse representations of neural networks parameters, carefully balancing between compression and preservation of information. However, a fundamental assumption behind pruning is that expendable weights should have small impact on the error of the network, while highly important weights should tend to have a larger influence on the inference. We argue that this idea could be generalized; what if a weight is not simply removed but also compensated with a perturbation of the adjacent bias, which does not contribute to the network sparsity? Our work introduces a novel pruning method in which the importance measure of each weight is computed considering the output behavior after an optimal perturbation of its adjacent bias, efficiently computable by automatic differentiation. These perturbations can be then applied directly after the removal of each weight, independently of each other.

Although it is known for the privacy-preserving capabilities, VFL still faces significant privacy and security threats from backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks typically involve an attacker implanting a trigger into the model during the training phase and executing the attack by adding the trigger to the samples during the inference phase. However, in this paper, we find that triggers are not essential for backdoor attacks in VFL. In light of this, we disclose a new backdoor attack pathway in VFL by introducing a feature-based triggerless backdoor attack. This attack operates under a more stringent security assumption, where the attacker is honest-but-curious rather than malicious during the training phase. It comprises three modules: label inference for the targeted backdoor attack, poison generation with amplification and perturbation mechanisms, and backdoor execution to implement the attack. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our attack outperforms three baseline backdoor attacks by 2 to 50 times while minimally impacting the main task. Even in VFL scenarios with 32 passive parties and only one set of auxiliary data, our attack maintains high performance. Moreover, when confronted with distinct defense strategies, our attack remains largely unaffected and exhibits strong robustness.

While AI for Science has witnessed the transformative power of foundation models in disciplines like genomics and meteorology, urban computing remains fragmented due to \"scenario-specific\" models, which are overfitted to specific regions or tasks, hindering their generalizability. To bridge this gap and advance spatio-temporal foundation models for urban systems, we adopt scaling as the central perspective and systematically investigate two key questions: what to scale and how to scale. Grounded in first-principles analysis, we identify three critical dimensions: heterogeneity, correlation, and dynamics, aligning these principles with the fundamental scientific properties of urban spatio-temporal data. Specifically, to address heterogeneity through data scaling, we construct WorldST. This billion-scale corpus standardizes diverse physical signals, such as traffic flow and speed, from over 100 global cities into a unified data format. To enable computation scaling for modeling correlations, we introduce the MiniST unit, a novel split mechanism that discretizes continuous spatio-temporal fields into learnable computational units to unify representations of grid-based and sensor-based observations.

Recent vision-language methods incorporate textual semantics generated by large language models, but treat these descriptions as static class-level priors that are shared across all samples and lack sample-wise refinement. This limits both the diversity and precision of visual-semantic alignment, hindering generalization under limited supervision. To overcome this, we propose the stochastic MUlti-view Semantic Enhancement (MUSE), a framework that first refines semantic precision via sample-wise adaptation and then enhances semantic richness through retrieval-augmented multi-view generation. Specifically, MUSE introduces Sample-wise Fine-grained Semantic Enhancement (SFSE), which yields a fine-grained semantic prior for each sample through MoE-based adaptive visual-semantic interaction. Guided by this prior, Stochastic Multi-view Model Optimization (SMMO) constructs an LLM-generated knowledge base of diverse pathological descriptions per class, then retrieves and stochastically integrates multiple matched textual views during training.

The resulting bounds are of order $O(1/\\sqrt{S})$ with respect to the number of training samples $S$, and include a structure-dependent negative term, yielding depth-uniform and asymptotic generalization bounds under milder assumptions.

Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that direct vertex position prediction via neural network heatmap regression is fundamentally not viable for this task: the heatmap decoder consistently fails to converge (loss plateau at 0.061) while the segmentation decoder trains normally under identical conditions.

The dominant approaches in this family of methods, such as Ring Attention or DeepSpeed Ulysses, enable scaling over the context dimension but do not focus on memory efficiency, which limits the sequence lengths they can support. More advanced techniques, such as Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer or activation offloading, can further extend the possible context length at the cost of training throughput. In this paper, we present UPipe, a simple yet effective context parallelism technique that performs fine-grained chunking at the attention head level. This technique significantly reduces the activation memory usage of self-attention, breaking the activation memory barrier and unlocking much longer context lengths. Our approach reduces intermediate tensor memory usage in the attention layer by as much as 87.5$\\%$ for 32B Transformers, while matching previous context parallelism techniques in terms of training speed.

Current methodologies attempt to bridge this domain gap either by relying on explicit 3D modalities or by augmenting VLMs with partial, view-conditioned geometric priors. However, such approaches hinder scalability and ultimately burden the language model with the ill-posed task of implicitly reconstructing holistic 3D geometry from sparse cues. In this paper, we argue that spatial intelligence can emerge inherently from 2D vision alone, rather than being imposed via explicit spatial instruction tuning. To this end, we introduce Spa3R, a self-supervised framework that learns a unified, view-invariant spatial representation directly from unposed multi-view images. Spa3R is built upon the proposed Predictive Spatial Field Modeling (PSFM) paradigm, where Spa3R learns to synthesize feature fields for arbitrary unseen views conditioned on a compact latent representation, thereby internalizing a holistic and coherent understanding of the underlying 3D scene. We further integrate the pre-trained Spa3R Encoder into existing VLMs via a lightweight adapter to form Spa3-VLM, effectively grounding language reasoning in a global spatial context. Experiments on the challenging VSI-Bench demonstrate that Spa3-VLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 58.6% on 3D VQA, significantly outperforming prior methods.

Identification of regions of interest (ROIs) is central to scientific imaging, as it enables isolation and quantitative analysis of specific structural features within complex datasets. In practice, however, ROIs are typically derived indirectly through full structure segmentation followed by post hoc analysis. This limitation is especially apparent for continuous and geometrically complex structures such as membranes, which are segmented as single entities. Here, we developed TomoROIS-SurfORA, a two step framework for direct, shape-agnostic ROI segmentation and morphological surface analysis. TomoROIS performs deep learning-based ROI segmentation and can be trained from scratch using small annotated datasets, enabling practical application across diverse imaging data. SurfORA processes segmented structures as point clouds and surface meshes to extract quantitative morphological features, including inter-membrane distances, curvature, and surface roughness. It supports both closed and open surfaces, with specific considerations for open surfaces, which are common in cryo-ET due to the missing wedge effect.
