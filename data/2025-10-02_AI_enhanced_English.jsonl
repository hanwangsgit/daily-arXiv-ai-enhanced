Prior work generally assumes\nthat process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning\nstep, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final\nanswer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent\ndomains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants,\ndiscriminative ORM and PRM (\\DisORM, \\DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM\n(\\GenORM, \\GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,\nwe find that (i) \\DisORM performs on par with \\DisPRM, (ii) \\GenPRM is not\ncompetitive, and (iii) overall, \\GenORM is the most robust, yielding\nsignificant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this\nto PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM\nauto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories,\nincluding those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis\nshows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows,\nand our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge\nthe prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and\nsupport generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment.

However, recent findings reveal that unlearning\neffects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight\nquantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.\nPrior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives\nby explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take\na different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent\nof unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We\nshow that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it\nexploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order\n(gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the\nresilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,\nsuch as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,\ngradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While\nthese optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage\nconvergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby\nresisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with\nrandomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust\nunlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that\ncombines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy\nwhile enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP\nbenchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our\napproach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning\nquality.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM unlearning often lacks robustness against post-training manipulations.

To reduce vulnerability to\nverifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\\{0,1\\}$ during\ntraining. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \\textit{false negatives}\n(rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \\textit{false positives} (accepting\nincorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct\nfraction $\\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical\n$\\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large\nlanguage model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single\nadversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We\nformalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic\nreward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive\ntwo correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \\textit{backward}\ncorrection that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an\n\\textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a\n\\textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the\nexpected update direction aligns with the \\textit{clean gradient}; notably, it\nrequires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group\nrelative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on\nmath-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both\ncorrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges\nfaster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical\nappeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate\nonline by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared\nwith other state-of-the-art contenders.", "AI": {"tldr": "RLVR trains policies using automated verifiers instead of human labeling.

Many past studies leveraged multiple critics\nto enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the\noverestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered\nthe architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This\nstudy proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic\nreinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features,\nincluding selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration\nwith respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics\nusing a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill\nfactor. Theoretical analysis proves the learning stability and bounded\nestimation bias for the MAMC. The present study examines the performance on a\nwell-known reinforcement learning benchmark MuJoCo. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic\nbased reinforcement learning methods. Experimental analysis also indicates the\nproposed components are effective. Empirical analysis further investigates the\nvalidity of the proposed method, and shows its benefit on complicated problems.\nThe source code can be found at https://github.com/AndyWu101/MAMC.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic reinforcement learning method that uses multiple actors and critics with non-dominated sorting for actor selection, quantile-based ensemble strategy for evaluation, and exploits actors with best skill factor.", "motivation": "Address the limitation that few studies have considered architectures with multiple actors together with multiple critics in actor-critic reinforcement learning, despite past studies leveraging multiple critics to enhance policy evaluation accuracy.", "method": "MAMC method with three main features: 1) actor selection using non-dominated sorting based on skill and creativity factors, 2) evaluation using quantile-based ensemble strategy for both actors and critics, 3) exploitation of actors with best skill factor.", "result": "Outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic based reinforcement learning methods on MuJoCo benchmark, with experimental analysis showing proposed components are effective and empirical analysis validating benefits on complicated problems.", "conclusion": "The MAMC method provides stable learning with bounded estimation bias, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and effectiveness for complex reinforcement learning problems."}}

When\nno ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data\ntaken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus\ninferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal\ngeneralisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow\nmatching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal\ntrajectory inference algorithms.

The resulting\ninterpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild\nassumptions.
