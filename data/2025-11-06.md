*Ivan Zvonkov,Gabriel Tseng,Inbal Becker-Reshef,Hannah Kerner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geospatial embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth enable efficient and accurate cropland mapping in Togo, simplifying workflows and supporting land use change assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate land cover maps are essential for understanding land use change as a climate change driver, but current methods using geospatial embeddings remain underexplored in real-world applications.

Method: Produced cropland maps using geospatial embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth models for classification in Togo.

Result: Geospatial embeddings achieved high-accuracy cropland classification and simplified mapping workflows.

Conclusion: Geospatial embeddings offer an efficient approach for cropland mapping that can better support assessments of land use change and climate impacts.

Abstract: Accurate and up-to-date land cover maps are essential for understanding land
use change, a key driver of climate change. Geospatial embeddings offer a more
efficient and accessible way to map landscape features, yet their use in
real-world mapping applications remains underexplored. In this work, we
evaluated the utility of geospatial embeddings for cropland mapping in Togo. We
produced cropland maps using embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth. Our
findings show that geospatial embeddings can simplify workflows, achieve
high-accuracy cropland classification and ultimately support better assessments
of land use change and its climate impacts.

### [2] [Generative Hints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02933)
*Andy Dimnaku,Abdullah Yusuf Kavranoğlu,Yaser Abu-Mostafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative hints is a training method that uses generative models to create virtual examples for enforcing known invariances across the entire input space, outperforming standard data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data augmentation alone doesn't fully capture invariant properties since it only learns from transformations of training data, failing to enforce invariances across the entire input space.

Method: Leverage generative models trained on the training set to create unlabeled virtual examples, then train models in a semi-supervised manner using both classification and hint objectives on these virtual examples to enforce functional properties.

Result: Consistently outperforms standard data augmentation across datasets, architectures, and loss functions. Achieved up to 1.78% top-1 accuracy improvement on fine-grained visual classification benchmarks and 1.286% average boost on CheXpert X-ray dataset.

Conclusion: Generative hints effectively enforce known invariances across the entire input space, providing superior performance compared to standard data augmentation methods.

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used in vision to introduce variation and
mitigate overfitting, through enabling models to learn invariant properties,
such as spatial invariance. However, these properties are not fully captured by
data augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on
transformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a
training methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire
input space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training
set to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which
we refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce
functional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the
training dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised
manner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled
virtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across
datasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently
outperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On
popular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78%
top-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data
augmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray
dataset.

*Srikumar Sastry,Subash Khanal,Aayush Dhakal,Jiayu Lin,Dan Cher,Phoenix Jarosz,Nathan Jacobs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProM3E is a probabilistic masked multimodal embedding model for ecology that learns to infer missing modalities from context modalities, supports modality inversion, and enables cross-modal retrieval with mixed similarity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a multimodal model for ecology that can handle any-to-any generation of representations, learn what modalities to fuse for downstream tasks, and improve cross-modal retrieval performance.

Method: Uses masked modality reconstruction in embedding space, probabilistic modeling to analyze fusion feasibility, and combines inter-modal and intra-modal similarities for cross-modal retrieval.

Result: Achieves superior performance across all retrieval tasks and demonstrates strong representation learning capability through linear probing tasks.

Conclusion: ProM3E provides an effective probabilistic framework for multimodal representation learning in ecology with practical applications in cross-modal retrieval and downstream tasks.

Abstract: We introduce ProM3E, a probabilistic masked multimodal embedding model for
any-to-any generation of multimodal representations for ecology. ProM3E is
based on masked modality reconstruction in the embedding space, learning to
infer missing modalities given a few context modalities. By design, our model
supports modality inversion in the embedding space. The probabilistic nature of
our model allows us to analyse the feasibility of fusing various modalities for
given downstream tasks, essentially learning what to fuse. Using these features
of our model, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval approach that mixes
inter-modal and intra-modal similarities to achieve superior performance across
all retrieval tasks. We further leverage the hidden representation from our
model to perform linear probing tasks and demonstrate the superior
representation learning capability of our model. All our code, datasets and
model will be released at https://vishu26.github.io/prom3e.

### [4] [EvtSlowTV - A Large and Diverse Dataset for Event-Based Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02953)
*Sadiq Layi Macaulay,Nimet Kaygusuz,Simon Hadfield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvtSlowTV is a large-scale event camera dataset from YouTube footage with 13B+ events, enabling self-supervised depth estimation without frame annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based depth estimation methods are limited by small annotated datasets, restricting their real-world generalization.

Method: Curated large-scale dataset from YouTube footage (EvtSlowTV) and used self-supervised learning framework that preserves event data's asynchronous nature.

Result: EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing datasets and enhances model generalization to complex scenes and motions.

Conclusion: EvtSlowTV enables robust event-based depth estimation in challenging environments without frame-based annotations, leveraging event cameras' HDR and low latency advantages.

Abstract: Event cameras, with their high dynamic range (HDR) and low latency, offer a
promising alternative for robust depth estimation in challenging environments.
However, many event-based depth estimation approaches are constrained by
small-scale annotated datasets, limiting their generalizability to real-world
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce EvtSlowTV, a large-scale event
camera dataset curated from publicly available YouTube footage, which contains
more than 13B events across various environmental conditions and motions,
including seasonal hiking, flying, scenic driving, and underwater exploration.
EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets,
providing an unconstrained, naturalistic setting for event-based depth
learning. This work shows the suitability of EvtSlowTV for a self-supervised
learning framework to capitalise on the HDR potential of raw event streams. We
further demonstrate that training with EvtSlowTV enhances the model's ability
to generalise to complex scenes and motions. Our approach removes the need for
frame-based annotations and preserves the asynchronous nature of event data.

### [5] [Hybrid Convolution and Vision Transformer NAS Search Space for TinyML Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02992)
*Mikhael Djajapermana,Moritz Reiber,Daniel Mueller-Gritschneder,Ulf Schlichtmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new hybrid CNN-ViT neural architecture search space for efficient image classification models suitable for tinyML deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid CNN-ViT architectures are too large and computationally expensive for tinyML applications, requiring more efficient designs.

Method: Created a NAS search space with hybrid CNN-ViT blocks for local/global feature learning and novel searchable pooling layers for efficient feature reduction.

Result: On CIFAR10, the search space produced hybrid architectures that outperformed ResNet-based tinyML models in both accuracy and inference speed under size constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid CNN-ViT NAS search space enables finding efficient architectures that balance performance and computational cost for tinyML deployment.

Abstract: Hybrids of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT)
have outperformed pure CNN or ViT architecture. However, since these
architectures require large parameters and incur large computational costs,
they are unsuitable for tinyML deployment. This paper introduces a new hybrid
CNN-ViT search space for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find efficient
hybrid architectures for image classification. The search space covers hybrid
CNN and ViT blocks to learn local and global information, as well as the novel
Pooling block of searchable pooling layers for efficient feature map reduction.
Experimental results on the CIFAR10 dataset show that our proposed search space
can produce hybrid CNN-ViT architectures with superior accuracy and inference
speed to ResNet-based tinyML models under tight model size constraints.

### [6] [SCALE-VLP: Soft-Weighted Contrastive Volumetric Vision-Language Pre-training with Spatial-Knowledge Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02996)
*Ailar Mahdizadeh,Puria Azadi Moghadam,Xiangteng He,Shahriar Mirabbasi,Panos Nasiopoulos,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCALE-VLP is a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework for volumetric medical imaging that integrates volumetric spatial semantics and domain-aware knowledge to improve cross-modal alignment and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most vision-language models are limited to 2D data and binary supervision, overlooking continuous dependencies in volumetric data like CT scans. Existing approaches treat volumetric scans as independent 2D slices, compromising spatial coherence and underutilizing clinical semantics.

Method: Proposes SCALE-VLP framework that integrates (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical structure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g., radiological ontologies) to guide alignment using soft-weighted contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval, improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Shows consistent gains in zero-shot evaluation on out-of-domain external datasets.

Conclusion: SCALE-VLP demonstrates strong cross-task transferability (retrieval, report generation, classification) and cross-domain generalizability without further fine-tuning, indicating robust generalization ability for volumetric medical imaging.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong cross-modal
capabilities, yet most work remains limited to 2D data and assumes binary
supervision (i.e., positive vs. negative pairs), overlooking the continuous and
structured dependencies present in volumetric data such as CT. Existing
approaches often treat volumetric scans as independent 2D slices, compromising
spatial coherence and underutilizing rich clinical semantics. We propose
SCALE-VLP, a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework
that integrates (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical
structure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g.,
radiological ontologies) to guide alignment. This yields structurally
consistent and semantically grounded representations under limited supervision,
demonstrating strong cross-task transferability (retrieval, report generation,
and classification), and cross-domain generalizability with consistent gains
without further fine-tuning. In particular, compared to the previous state of
the art, SCALE-VLP achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval,
improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and
BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Further, in zero-shot evaluation on an
out-of-domain external dataset, we observe consistent gains, indicating the
cross-task and cross-domain generalization ability of SCALE-VLP.

### [7] [Learning with less: label-efficient land cover classification at very high spatial resolution using self-supervised deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03004)
*Dakota Hester,Vitor S. Martins,Lucas B. Ferreira,Thainara M. A. Lima*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A label-efficient approach for statewide 1-m land cover classification using only 1,000 annotated patches with self-supervised learning, achieving 87.14% accuracy for mapping Mississippi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of collecting large training datasets for deep learning semantic segmentation in land cover classification, enabling widespread adoption for meter-scale mapping over large areas.

Method: Used Bootstrap Your Own Latent pre-training with 377,921 unlabeled color-infrared aerial patches to pre-train ResNet-101, then transferred weights to multiple segmentation architectures (FCN, U-Net, etc.) and fine-tuned with small datasets (250-750 patches).

Result: Achieved 87.14% overall accuracy and 75.58% macro F1 score using ensemble of best U-Net models, mapping over 123 billion pixels across Mississippi with accurate water and forest mapping, though challenges remained for cropland/herbaceous/barren distinctions.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning effectively reduces the need for large manually annotated datasets, addressing a major limitation in high-resolution land cover mapping at scale.

Abstract: Deep learning semantic segmentation methods have shown promising performance
for very high 1-m resolution land cover classification, but the challenge of
collecting large volumes of representative training data creates a significant
barrier to widespread adoption of such models for meter-scale land cover
mapping over large areas. In this study, we present a novel label-efficient
approach for statewide 1-m land cover classification using only 1,000 annotated
reference image patches with self-supervised deep learning. We use the
"Bootstrap Your Own Latent" pre-training strategy with a large amount of
unlabeled color-infrared aerial images (377,921 256x256 1-m pixel patches) to
pre-train a ResNet-101 convolutional encoder. The learned encoder weights were
subsequently transferred into multiple deep semantic segmentation architectures
(FCN, U-Net, Attention U-Net, DeepLabV3+, UPerNet, PAN), which were then
fine-tuned using very small training dataset sizes with cross-validation (250,
500, 750 patches). Among the fine-tuned models, we obtained the 87.14% overall
accuracy and 75.58% macro F1 score using an ensemble of the best performing
U-Net models for comprehensive 1-m, 8-class land cover mapping, covering more
than 123 billion pixels over the state of Mississippi, USA. Detailed
qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed accurate mapping of open water
and forested areas, while highlighting challenges in accurate delineation
between cropland, herbaceous, and barren land cover types. These results show
that self-supervised learning is an effective strategy for reducing the need
for large volumes of manually annotated data, directly addressing a major
limitation to high spatial resolution land cover mapping at scale.

### [8] [A Foundation Model for Brain MRI with Dynamic Modality Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03014)
*Minh Sao Khue Luu,Bair N. Tuchinov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A foundation model for brain MRI that handles different combinations of imaging sequences using a single encoder with modality embeddings and masked autoencoding, trained on 60,000 multi-center MRIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified model that works with various MRI sequences without needing separate models for each modality, and handles missing or unseen sequences.

Method: Uses one encoder with learnable modality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, masked autoencoding objective with variance-covariance regularizer, and self-supervised reconstruction with modality imputation.

Result: Preliminary results show feasible performance; planned evaluation on brain tumor/MS segmentation and lesion classification under various modality settings.

Conclusion: The model successfully learns flexible representations for brain MRI across different modality combinations and handles missing data, with code and pretrained models publicly available.

Abstract: We present a foundation model for brain MRI that can work with different
combinations of imaging sequences. The model uses one encoder with learnable
modality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, and a masked autoencoding
objective that accounts for missing modalities. A variance-covariance
regularizer is applied to stabilize feature learning and improve representation
diversity. This design removes the need for separate models for each modality
and allows the network to adapt when some sequences are missing or unseen. It
is trained on about 60,000 multi-center MRIs using self-supervised
reconstruction and modality imputation to learn flexible representations. A
learnable modality embedding guides feature extraction so the encoder can
adjust to different inputs. We describe our planned evaluation on brain tumor
and multiple sclerosis segmentation, as well as lesion classification, under
various modality settings. Preliminary results show that the method works
feasibly, and further experiments are planned to study its performance in more
detail. All code and pretrained models are available at

### [9] [ISC-Perception: A Hybrid Computer Vision Dataset for Object Detection in Novel Steel Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03098)
*Miftahur Rahman,Samuel Adebayo,Dorian A. Acevedo-Mejia,David Hester,Daniel McPolin,Karen Rafferty,Debra F. Laefer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISC-Perception is the first hybrid dataset for Intermeshed Steel Connection component detection, combining synthetic CAD images, photorealistic game-engine scenes, and curated real photos to overcome data collection challenges on construction sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable dependable perception for ISC-aware robots by addressing the absence of dedicated image corpora due to logistical difficulties, safety concerns, and privacy issues on active construction sites.

Method: Created a hybrid dataset blending procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine photorealistic scenes, and curated real photographs with automatic labeling of synthetic portions, explicitly accounting for all human effort in dataset generation.

Result: Achieved 81.7% reduction in human time (30.5h vs 166.7h for 10,000 images), detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieved mAP@0.50 of 0.756, substantially outperforming synthetic-only or photorealistic-only models, with bench test results of 0.943/0.823 mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95].

Conclusion: ISC-Perception bridges the data gap for construction-robotics perception, enabling rapid development of custom object detectors and is available for research and industrial use.

Abstract: The Intermeshed Steel Connection (ISC) system, when paired with robotic
manipulators, can accelerate steel-frame assembly and improve worker safety by
eliminating manual assembly. Dependable perception is one of the initial stages
for ISC-aware robots. However, this is hampered by the absence of a dedicated
image corpus, as collecting photographs on active construction sites is
logistically difficult and raises safety and privacy concerns. In response, we
introduce ISC-Perception, the first hybrid dataset expressly designed for ISC
component detection. It blends procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine
photorealistic scenes, and a limited, curated set of real photographs, enabling
fully automatic labelling of the synthetic portion. We explicitly account for
all human effort to produce the dataset, including simulation engine and scene
setup, asset preparation, post-processing scripts and quality checks; our total
human time to generate a 10,000-image dataset was 30.5,h versus 166.7,h for
manual labelling at 60,s per image (-81.7%). A manual pilot on a representative
image with five instances of ISC members took 60,s (maximum 80,s), anchoring
the manual baseline. Detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieved a mean
Average Precision at IoU 0.50 of 0.756, substantially surpassing models trained
on synthetic-only or photorealistic-only data. On a 1,200-frame bench test, we
report mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95] of 0.943/0.823. By bridging the data gap for
construction-robotics perception, ISC-Perception facilitates rapid development
of custom object detectors and is freely available for research and industrial
use upon request.

### [10] [SLIP: Structural-aware Language-Image Pretraining for Vision-Language Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03019)
*Wenbo Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLIP introduces structural contrastive learning to VLP by modeling relationships between neighboring entities in graphs, outperforming CLIP on cross-modal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLP methods treat image-text pairs in isolation, ignoring rich relational structures present in real-world domains like e-commerce and social networks.

Method: Integrates structural contrastive loss to align modalities while modeling relationships between neighboring entities in structured graphs, using a large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset.

Result: Consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Relational supervision provides significant value for cross-modal alignment in vision-language pretraining.

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has achieved remarkable success across
various downstream tasks, but such gains are largely driven by scaling up on
training data. Yet, literature methods treat image-text pairs as isolated
training examples; this neglects the rich relational structure naturally
present in many domains, such as e-commerce product co-purchase graphs and
social recommendation networks. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that human
encodes knowledge as relationship cognitive maps, we introduce Structure-aware
Language-Image Pretraining (SLIP). SLIP integrates a structural contrastive
loss to align modalities while also modeling relationships between neighboring
entities in a structured graph. To support this paradigm, we construct a
large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset, enabling
structured cross-modality supervision at scale. Experiment results show that
SLIP consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification
tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, showing the value of relational
supervision for cross-modal alignment.

### [11] [From Propagation to Prediction: Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of MLS Point Clouds under Limited Ground Truth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03053)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learning-based framework for Mobile Laser Scanning point clouds that predicts point-level uncertainty using geometric features, eliminating the need for ground truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground truth acquisition for uncertainty evaluation in MLS point clouds is costly and often infeasible in real-world applications, creating a need for alternative evaluation methods.

Method: Integration of optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction using machine learning models (XGBoost and Random Forest) to predict point-level uncertainty quantified by C2C distance.

Result: The framework is feasible and XGBoost achieves comparable accuracy to Random Forest while being 3 times faster, demonstrating that geometric features can effectively predict uncertainty.

Conclusion: MLS point clouds' uncertainty is learnable, providing a novel learning-based approach to uncertainty evaluation that doesn't rely on ground truth data.

Abstract: Evaluating uncertainty is critical for reliable use of Mobile Laser Scanning
(MLS) point clouds in many high-precision applications such as Scan-to-BIM,
deformation analysis, and 3D modeling. However, obtaining the ground truth (GT)
for evaluation is often costly and infeasible in many real-world applications.
To reduce this long-standing reliance on GT in uncertainty evaluation research,
this study presents a learning-based framework for MLS point clouds that
integrates optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction.
Experiments on a real-world dataset show that the proposed framework is
feasible and the XGBoost model delivers fully comparable accuracy to Random
Forest while achieving substantially higher efficiency (about 3 times faster),
providing initial evidence that geometric features can be used to predict
point-level uncertainty quantified by the C2C distance. In summary, this study
shows that MLS point clouds' uncertainty is learnable, offering a novel
learning-based viewpoint towards uncertainty evaluation research.

### [12] [A Plug-and-Play Framework for Volumetric Light-Sheet Image Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03093)
*Yi Gong,Xinyuan Zhang,Jichen Chai,Yichen Ding,Yifei Lou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computational imaging framework combining Compressive Sensing with Light-Sheet Microscopy for high-speed, low-phototoxic cardiac imaging using DMD-based compressed acquisition and PnP-ADMM reconstruction with temporal regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optical imaging struggles with the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution needed to capture dynamic cellular structure in beating hearts on millisecond timescales.

Method: Uses DMD-based compressed acquisition with random binary masks, then applies Plug-and-Play ADMM framework with advanced denoisers (Tikhonov, TV, BM3D) and temporal regularization for smoothness between z-slices.

Result: Successfully reconstructs cellular structures in zebrafish heart imaging under high compression ratios with excellent denoising performance and image clarity.

Conclusion: The method effectively overcomes limitations of traditional imaging for high-speed, low-light biological scenarios, demonstrating robust performance in real-world cardiac imaging applications.

Abstract: Cardiac contraction is a rapid, coordinated process that unfolds across
three-dimensional tissue on millisecond timescales. Traditional optical imaging
is often inadequate for capturing dynamic cellular structure in the beating
heart because of a fundamental trade-off between spatial and temporal
resolution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-performance
computational imaging framework that integrates Compressive Sensing (CS) with
Light-Sheet Microscopy (LSM) for efficient, low-phototoxic cardiac imaging. The
system performs compressed acquisition of fluorescence signals via random
binary mask coding using a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD). We propose a
Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, solved using the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM), which flexibly incorporates advanced denoisers, including
Tikhonov, Total Variation (TV), and BM3D. To preserve structural continuity in
dynamic imaging, we further introduce temporal regularization enforcing
smoothness between adjacent z-slices. Experimental results on zebrafish heart
imaging under high compression ratios demonstrate that the proposed method
successfully reconstructs cellular structures with excellent denoising
performance and image clarity, validating the effectiveness and robustness of
our algorithm in real-world high-speed, low-light biological imaging scenarios.

### [13] [DentalSplat: Dental Occlusion Novel View Synthesis from Sparse Intra-Oral Photographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03099)
*Yiyi Miao,Taoyu Wu,Tong Chen,Sihao Li,Ji Jiang,Youpeng Yang,Angelos Stefanidis,Limin Yu,Jionglong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DentalSplat: A 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for dental occlusion reconstruction from sparse orthodontic images (3 views) that addresses pose uncertainty and view sparsity through prior-guided initialization, scale-adaptive pruning, and geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Orthodontic telemedicine requires 3D dental occlusion visualization from sparse clinical images, but conventional 3DGS methods need dense multi-view inputs and precise camera poses, which are unavailable in typical orthodontic cases with only anterior and bilateral buccal views.

Method: Uses prior-guided dense stereo reconstruction for point cloud initialization, scale-adaptive pruning for efficiency, and incorporates optical flow geometric constraints with gradient regularization for sparse view scenarios.

Result: Validated on 950 clinical cases and 195 video-based test cases, achieving superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DentalSplat effectively handles sparse orthodontic imagery and pose uncertainty, enabling practical 3D reconstruction for telemedicine applications.

Abstract: In orthodontic treatment, particularly within telemedicine contexts,
observing patients' dental occlusion from multiple viewpoints facilitates
timely clinical decision-making. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view
synthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely
captured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting
their practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three
sparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views,
rendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity
of input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of
camera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these
limitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D
reconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a
prior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud,
followed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training
efficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS. In scenarios with extremely
sparse viewpoints, we further incorporate optical flow as a geometric
constraint, coupled with gradient regularization, to enhance rendering
fidelity. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset comprising 950
clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases designed to
simulate real-world remote orthodontic imaging conditions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method effectively handles sparse input scenarios and
achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion
visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

### [14] [Image-Intrinsic Priors for Integrated Circuit Defect Detection and Novel Class Discovery via Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03120)
*Botong. Zhao,Xubin. Wang,Shujing. Lyu,Yue. Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IC DefectNCD is a support set free framework for IC defect detection and novel class discovery that leverages image intrinsic priors in SEM images, achieving robust performance without extensive human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised methods require extensive human annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare defects, while clustering-based unsupervised methods exhibit unstable performance due to missing priors.

Method: Uses Self Normal Information Guided defect detection with learnable normal feature extractor, adaptive binarization for saliency variations, and Self Defect Information Guided classification with soft mask guided attention mechanism in teacher-student model.

Result: Validated on real-world dataset spanning three fabrication stages and 15 defect types, demonstrating robust performance on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by leveraging image intrinsic priors, enabling reliable defect detection and classification of unseen defects without extensive human supervision.

Abstract: Integrated circuit manufacturing is highly complex, comprising hundreds of
process steps. Defects can arise at any stage, causing yield loss and
ultimately degrading product reliability. Supervised methods require extensive
human annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare, data scarce
defects. Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable
performance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free
framework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect
detection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information
Guided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a
learnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to
coarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects,
we introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages
focused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information
Guided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided
attention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student
model. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background
interference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We
validate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication
stages and covering 15 defect types. Experiments demonstrate robust performance
on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.

Motivation: To enable augmented visual cognition by minimizing run-time latency in physical property reasoning pipelines for real-world applications like smart glasses.

Method: Combines algorithmic and systematic optimizations including rapid geometric 3D reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding.

Result: Achieves 62.9×-287.2× speedup while maintaining or slightly improving object-level physical property estimation accuracy, with superior performance in material segmentation and voxel-level inference compared to SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: \sysname provides robust physical property estimations in real-world scenarios, demonstrated through successful case studies with Meta Aria Glasses in cluttered environments like IKEA stores.

Abstract: This paper introduces \sysname, a system that accelerates vision-guided
physical property reasoning to enable augmented visual cognition. \sysname
minimizes the run-time latency of this reasoning pipeline through a combination
of both algorithmic and systematic optimizations, including rapid geometric 3D
reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding.
Through these simple yet effective optimizations, \sysname reduces the
end-to-end latency of this reasoning pipeline from 10--20 minutes to less than
6 seconds. A head-to-head comparison on the ABO dataset shows that \sysname
achieves this 62.9$\times$--287.2$\times$ speedup while not only reaching
on-par (and sometimes slightly better) object-level physical property
estimation accuracy(e.g. mass), but also demonstrating superior performance in
material segmentation and voxel-level inference than two SOTA baselines. We
further combine gaze-tracking with \sysname to localize the object of interest
in cluttered, real-world environments, streamlining the physical property
reasoning on smart glasses. The case study with Meta Aria Glasses conducted at
an IKEA furniture store demonstrates that \sysname achives consistently high
performance compared to controlled captures, providing robust property
estimations even with fewer views in real-world scenarios.

### [16] [Deploying Rapid Damage Assessments from sUAS Imagery for Disaster Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03132)
*Thomas Manzini,Priyankari Perali,Robin R. Murphy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First operational AI/ML system for automated building damage assessment using sUAS imagery deployed during Hurricanes Debby and Helene, processing 415 buildings in 18 minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the data avalanche problem where sUAS teams deliver 47GB-369GB of imagery per day during disasters, overwhelming human analysis capabilities and delaying response efforts.

Method: Developed models trained on largest known post-disaster sUAS dataset (21,716 building damage labels) and operationally trained 91 disaster practitioners. Deployed best performing model during actual disaster responses.

Result: Successfully deployed during Hurricanes Debby and Helene, assessing 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes, establishing the state of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems.

Conclusion: This work contributes the first documented operational use of AI/ML for damage assessment during disasters and provides lessons learned for both AI/ML research and user communities.

Abstract: This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage
assessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed
operationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and
Helene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect
imagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters,
teams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day,
representing more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by
subject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts.
To alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and
machine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed
to automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state
of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has
been confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice
via the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment
with sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known
dataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage
labels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best
performing model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and
Helene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes.
This work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage
assessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML
research and user communities.

*Sagar Shrestha,Gopal Sharma,Luowei Zhou,Suren Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fine-tuning-free personalization method using Hypernetworks that predict LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images, eliminating per-subject optimization while maintaining subject fidelity and prompt alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional subject-specific fine-tuning methods like DreamBooth are computationally expensive and slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods still require additional fine-tuning or large backbone models for satisfactory results.

Method: Uses Hypernetworks to predict LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images with end-to-end training objective stabilized by output regularization. Introduces Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG) to combine base diffusion model's compositional strengths with personalized model's subject fidelity during sampling.

Result: Achieves strong personalization performance on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench benchmarks. Removes need for per-subject optimization at test time while preserving subject fidelity and prompt alignment.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the promise of hypernetworks as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models has traditionally relied on
subject-specific fine-tuning approaches such as
DreamBooth~\cite{ruiz2023dreambooth}, which are computationally expensive and
slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods attempt to reduce
this overhead but still depend on additional fine-tuning or large backbone
models for satisfactory results. In this work, we revisit an orthogonal
direction: fine-tuning-free personalization via Hypernetworks that predict
LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images. Prior hypernetwork-based
approaches, however, suffer from costly data generation or unstable attempts to
mimic base model optimization trajectories. We address these limitations with
an end-to-end training objective, stabilized by a simple output regularization,
yielding reliable and effective hypernetworks. Our method removes the need for
per-subject optimization at test time while preserving both subject fidelity
and prompt alignment. To further enhance compositional generalization at
inference time, we introduce Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG),
which combines the compositional strengths of the base diffusion model with the
subject fidelity of personalized models during sampling. Extensive experiments
on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench demonstrate that our approach achieves
strong personalization performance and highlights the promise of hypernetworks
as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization.

### [18] [Subsampled Randomized Fourier GaLore for Adapting Foundation Models in Depth-Driven Liver Landmark Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03163)
*Yun-Chen Lin,Jiayuan Huang,Hanyuan Zhang,Sergi Kavtaradze,Matthew J. Clarkson,Mobarak I. Hoque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A depth-guided liver landmark segmentation framework using SAM2 and Depth Anything V2 encoders with SRFT-GaLore for efficient fine-tuning, achieving improved segmentation accuracy and cross-dataset generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of anatomical structures in laparoscopic liver surgery is challenging due to limited depth perception in 2D video streams, requiring better fusion of RGB and depth features and efficient adaptation of large vision models.

Method: Uses SAM2 encoder for RGB features and Depth Anything V2 encoder for depth features, with SRFT-GaLore (Subsampled Randomized Fourier Transform) for efficient fine-tuning and cross-attention fusion module to integrate RGB and depth cues.

Result: Achieves 4.85% improvement in Dice Similarity Coefficient and 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface Distance on L3D dataset, with competitive performance on new LLSD dataset demonstrating strong cross-dataset robustness.

Conclusion: The SRFT-GaLore-enhanced dual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation under real-time surgical settings with strong adaptability to unseen surgical environments.

Abstract: Accurate detection and delineation of anatomical structures in medical
imaging are critical for computer-assisted interventions, particularly in
laparoscopic liver surgery where 2D video streams limit depth perception and
complicate landmark localization. While recent works have leveraged monocular
depth cues for enhanced landmark detection, challenges remain in fusing RGB and
depth features and in efficiently adapting large-scale vision models to
surgical domains. We propose a depth-guided liver landmark segmentation
framework integrating semantic and geometric cues via vision foundation
encoders. We employ Segment Anything Model V2 (SAM2) encoder to extract RGB
features and Depth Anything V2 (DA2) encoder to extract depth-aware features.
To efficiently adapt SAM2, we introduce SRFT-GaLore, a novel low-rank gradient
projection method that replaces the computationally expensive SVD with a
Subsampled Randomized Fourier Transform (SRFT). This enables efficient
fine-tuning of high-dimensional attention layers without sacrificing
representational power. A cross-attention fusion module further integrates RGB
and depth cues. To assess cross-dataset generalization, we also construct a new
Laparoscopic Liver Surgical Dataset (LLSD) as an external validation benchmark.
On the public L3D dataset, our method achieves a 4.85% improvement in Dice
Similarity Coefficient and a 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface
Distance compared to the D2GPLand. To further assess generalization capability,
we evaluate our model on LLSD dataset. Our model maintains competitive
performance and significantly outperforms SAM-based baselines, demonstrating
strong cross-dataset robustness and adaptability to unseen surgical
environments. These results demonstrate that our SRFT-GaLore-enhanced
dual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation under
real-time, depth-constrained surgical settings.

*Shreyas C. Dhake,Jiayuan Huang,Runlong He,Danyal Z. Khan,Evangelos B. Mazomenos,Sophia Bano,Hani J. Marcus,Danail Stoyanov,Matthew J. Clarkson,Mobarak I. Hoque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PitVQA-Anticipation is the first VQA dataset for surgical anticipation, featuring 33.5 hours of video and 734K QA pairs. SurgAnt-ViVQA model uses GRU-based temporal encoding and gated cross-attention to outperform baselines on future prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical VQA systems focus on static frame analysis and lack anticipation capabilities needed for real-time assistance in endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery where visibility is limited and workflow changes rapidly.

Method: Proposed SurgAnt-ViVQA model adapts a large language model with GRU Gated Temporal Cross-Attention module. Uses bidirectional GRU for frame dynamics and adaptive gate for visual context injection. Parameter efficient fine-tuning customizes to surgical domain.

Result: SurgAnt-ViVQA surpasses strong image and video baselines on PitVQA-Anticipation and EndoVis datasets. 8 frames maximize fluency, while 32 frames slightly reduce BLEU but improve numeric time estimation. Temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most performance gains.

Conclusion: The model advances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation. PitVQA-Anticipation provides a benchmark highlighting the importance of targeted temporal modeling for future-aware surgical assistance.

Abstract: Anticipating forthcoming surgical events is vital for real-time assistance in
endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, where visibility is limited and
workflow changes rapidly. Most visual question answering (VQA) systems reason
on isolated frames with static vision language alignment, providing little
support for forecasting next steps or instrument needs. Existing surgical VQA
datasets likewise center on the current scene rather than the near future. We
introduce PitVQA-Anticipation, the first VQA dataset designed for forward
looking surgical reasoning. It comprises 33.5 hours of operative video and
734,769 question answer pairs built from temporally grouped clips and expert
annotations across four tasks: predicting the future phase, next step, upcoming
instrument, and remaining duration. We further propose SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video
language model that adapts a large language model using a GRU Gated Temporal
Cross-Attention module. A bidirectional GRU encodes frame to frame dynamics,
while an adaptive gate injects visual context into the language stream at the
token level. Parameter efficient fine tuning customizes the language backbone
to the surgical domain. SurgAnt-ViVQA tested upon on PitVQA-Anticipation and
EndoVis datasets, surpassing strong image and video based baselines. Ablations
show that temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most of the gains. A frame
budget study indicates a trade-off: 8 frames maximize fluency, whereas 32
frames slightly reduce BLEU but improve numeric time estimation. By pairing a
temporally aware encoder with fine grained gated cross-attention, SurgAnt-ViVQA
advances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation.
PitVQA-Anticipation offers a comprehensive benchmark for this setting and
highlights the importance of targeted temporal modeling for reliable, future
aware surgical assistance.

*Kuei-Chun Kao,Hsu Tzu-Yin,Yunqi Hong,Ruochen Wang,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes QG-CoC, a zero-shot prompting method that improves multimodal LLMs' ability to handle multi-image reasoning tasks by addressing fine-grained perception and information synthesis issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with fine-grained perception across multiple images and effective reasoning over multiple visual inputs, creating a gap in handling complex multi-image tasks.

Method: QG-CoC (Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions) - a zero-shot prompting approach that generates captions guided by questions to handle arbitrary numbers of images.

Result: Competitive performance across multi-image and single-image benchmarks, with robust improvements in challenging scenarios where existing methods fail.

Conclusion: QG-CoC effectively addresses multi-image reasoning limitations in MLLMs and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across various tasks and models.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues
in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate
images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and
synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various
prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus
primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This
leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more
general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively
investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details
and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings
reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues
and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings,
we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions
(QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems
with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various
open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image
benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive
performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging
scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MvBody, a multi-view Transformer network using 3D body scans and self-reported data for cesarean section risk prediction, achieving 84.62% accuracy with explainable AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for early CS risk assessment in resource-limited settings where traditional hospital-based models are unavailable, requiring affordable general devices.

Method: Multi-view Transformer network (MvBody) using 3D optical body scans (31-38 weeks gestation) and self-reported medical data, enhanced with metric learning for data-scarce environments.

Result: Achieved 84.62% accuracy and 0.724 AUC-ROC, outperforming existing ML models and 3D analysis methods on independent test set.

Conclusion: 3D body shape analysis combined with medical data enables effective CS risk prediction, with key factors being pre-pregnancy weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS, and head/shoulder body shape.

Abstract: Accurately assessing the risk of cesarean section (CS) delivery is critical,
especially in settings with limited medical resources, where access to
healthcare is often restricted. Early and reliable risk prediction allows
better-informed prenatal care decisions and can improve maternal and neonatal
outcomes. However, most existing predictive models are tailored for in-hospital
use during labor and rely on parameters that are often unavailable in
resource-limited or home-based settings. In this study, we conduct a pilot
investigation to examine the feasibility of using 3D body shape for CS risk
assessment for future applications with more affordable general devices. We
propose a novel multi-view-based Transformer network, MvBody, which predicts CS
risk using only self-reported medical data and 3D optical body scans obtained
between the 31st and 38th weeks of gestation. To enhance training efficiency
and model generalizability in data-scarce environments, we incorporate a metric
learning loss into the network. Compared to widely used machine learning models
and the latest advanced 3D analysis methods, our method demonstrates superior
performance, achieving an accuracy of 84.62% and an Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.724 on the independent test set.
To improve transparency and trust in the model's predictions, we apply the
Integrated Gradients algorithm to provide theoretically grounded explanations
of the model's decision-making process. Our results indicate that pre-pregnancy
weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS history, and body shape,
particularly around the head and shoulders, are key contributors to CS risk
prediction.

*Pengyu Jie,Wanquan Liu,Rui He,Yihui Wen,Deyu Meng,Chenqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MCPMix and RLA for endoscopic segmentation, combining diffusion-guided synthesis with mask-consistent mixing and adaptive re-anchoring to real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing augmentation methods: mixing causes soft label ambiguity, while diffusion synthesis introduces domain shift and overlooks mask conditioning benefits.

Method: Generates synthetic counterparts for real images under same masks, then uses Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix) to mix appearances while preserving original hard masks. Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts mixing strength and loss weights.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance across multiple datasets including Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC 2017.

Conclusion: Combining label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity and adaptive re-anchoring yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.

Abstract: Augmentation for dense prediction typically relies on either sample mixing or
generative synthesis. Mixing improves robustness but misaligned masks yield
soft label ambiguity. Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but,
when trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask
conditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired,
diffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real
image, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is
used as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which
mixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard
mask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly
bridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging
diversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned
with real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the
mixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually
re-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias.
Across Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC
2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and
consistent gains over baselines. The results show that combining
label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity, together with adaptive
re-anchoring, yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.

TL;DR: T-PMambaSR is a lightweight super-resolution framework that combines window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba to enable fine-grained multi-scale modeling with linear complexity, outperforming recent Transformer and Mamba methods with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based super-resolution methods lack fine-grained transitions across different modeling scales, limiting feature representation efficiency. The paper aims to address this limitation while maintaining linear complexity.

Method: Proposed T-PMambaSR integrates window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba to enable interactions among receptive fields of different scales. Also introduced an Adaptive High-Frequency Refinement Module (AHFRM) to recover lost high-frequency details.

Result: Extensive experiments show T-PMambaSR progressively enhances the model's receptive field and expressiveness, achieving better performance than recent Transformer- or Mamba-based methods with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed T-PMambaSR framework successfully establishes a fine-grained modeling paradigm that progressively enhances feature representation with linear complexity, making it an efficient and effective solution for super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based super-resolution (SR) methods have demonstrated the
ability to capture global receptive fields with linear complexity, addressing
the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based SR approaches. However,
existing Mamba-based methods lack fine-grained transitions across different
modeling scales, which limits the efficiency of feature representation. In this
paper, we propose T-PMambaSR, a lightweight SR framework that integrates
window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba. By enabling interactions
among receptive fields of different scales, our method establishes a
fine-grained modeling paradigm that progressively enhances feature
representation with linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive
High-Frequency Refinement Module (AHFRM) to recover high-frequency details lost
during Transformer and Mamba processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
T-PMambaSR progressively enhances the model's receptive field and
expressiveness, yielding better performance than recent Transformer- or
Mamba-based methods while incurring lower computational cost. Our codes will be
released after acceptance.

TL;DR: DMPO method decouples low-level representative and high-level discriminative abilities in early stages of multi-stage predictors through architectural modifications and decoupled optimization, improving inference efficiency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of early stages providing both low-level fundamental features to deep stages and high-level discriminative features to early-stage predictors simultaneously, which is crucial for inference efficiency in large-scale pre-trained models.

Method: Proposes Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization (DMPO) with: 1) lightweight bypass module for functional decomposition of shallow features, 2) high-order statistics-based predictor for early stages, and 3) two-phase decoupled optimization with weighted losses that first prioritizes deep stage discriminative ability then pushes discriminative ability to earlier stages.

Result: Experiments across various datasets and pre-trained backbones demonstrate that DMPO clearly outperforms counterparts when reducing computational cost.

Conclusion: DMPO effectively decouples representative and discriminative abilities in early stages through both architecture design and model optimization, achieving better inference efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in large-scale pre-trained model
tuning, and inference efficiency is becoming more crucial for practical
deployment. Early exiting in conjunction with multi-stage predictors, when
cooperated with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, offers a
straightforward way to achieve an inference-efficient model. However, a key
challenge remains unresolved: How can early stages provide low-level
fundamental features to deep stages while simultaneously supplying high-level
discriminative features to early-stage predictors? To address this problem, we
propose a Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization (DMPO) method to effectively
decouple the low-level representative ability and high-level discriminative
ability in early stages. First, in terms of architecture, we introduce a
lightweight bypass module into multi-stage predictors for functional
decomposition of shallow features from early stages, while a high-order
statistics-based predictor is developed for early stages to effectively enhance
their discriminative ability. To reasonably train our multi-predictor
architecture, a decoupled optimization is proposed to allocate two-phase loss
weights for multi-stage predictors during model tuning, where the initial
training phase enables the model to prioritize the acquisition of
discriminative ability of deep stages via emphasizing representative ability of
early stages, and the latter training phase drives discriminative ability
towards earlier stages as much as possible. As such, our DMPO can effectively
decouple representative and discriminative abilities in early stages in terms
of architecture design and model optimization. Experiments across various
datasets and pre-trained backbones demonstrate that DMPO clearly outperforms
its counterparts when reducing computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative method for translating between color flow doppler and greyscale ultrasound videos achieves realistic results (SSIM 0.91) and performs indistinguishably from real videos in clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data imbalance in ultrasound studies where different sub-modalities like greyscale and color flow doppler are often imbalanced, which limits deep learning applications in medical imaging.

Method: Used a generative approach with pixel-wise, adversarial, and perceptual losses, employing two networks: one for reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising to create realistic ultrasound imaging.

Result: Achieved average SSIM of 0.91±0.04 between synthetic and real videos. Synthetic videos performed similarly to real ones in classification (F1: 0.89 vs 0.9) and segmentation (Dice: 0.97). Clinicians could only distinguish real vs synthetic videos with 54±6% accuracy.

Conclusion: The method successfully creates realistic synthetic ultrasound videos that expand utility of retrospective imaging and augment dataset design for medical imaging, demonstrating foundational capabilities across clinical domains despite being trained only on heart videos.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has the potential to revolutionize image acquisition and
interpretation across medicine, however, attention to data imbalance and
missingness is required. Ultrasound data presents a particular challenge
because in addition to different views and structures, it includes several
sub-modalities-such as greyscale and color flow doppler (CFD)-that are often
imbalanced in clinical studies. Image translation can help balance datasets but
is challenging for ultrasound sub-modalities to date. Here, we present a
generative method for ultrasound CFD-greyscale video translation, trained on
54,975 videos and tested on 8,368. The method developed leveraged pixel-wise,
adversarial, and perceptual loses and utilized two networks: one for
reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising to achieve realistic
ultrasound imaging. Average pairwise SSIM between synthetic videos and ground
truth was 0.91+/-0.04. Synthetic videos performed indistinguishably from real
ones in DL classification and segmentation tasks and when evaluated by blinded
clinical experts: F1 score was 0.9 for real and 0.89 for synthetic videos; Dice
score between real and synthetic segmentation was 0.97. Overall clinician
accuracy in distinguishing real vs synthetic videos was 54+/-6% (42-61%),
indicating realistic synthetic videos. Although trained only on heart videos,
the model worked well on ultrasound spanning several clinical domains (average
SSIM 0.91+/-0.05), demonstrating foundational abilities. Together, these data
expand the utility of retrospectively collected imaging and augment the dataset
design toolbox for medical imaging.

### [28] [IEC3D-AD: A 3D Dataset of Industrial Equipment Components for Unsupervised Point Cloud Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03267)
*Bingyang Guo,Hongjie Li,Ruiyun Yu,Hanzhe Liang,Jinbao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IEC3D-AD, a new industrial equipment component anomaly detection dataset with higher resolution and better defect annotations than existing datasets, and proposes GMANet, a 3D anomaly detection method using geometric morphological analysis and spatial discrepancy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D anomaly detection datasets lack the complexity and subtle defects found in real industrial environments, limiting precise anomaly detection research for industrial equipment components like bearings, rings, and bolts.

Method: Developed IEC3D-AD dataset collected from actual production lines, and proposed GMANet method that generates synthetic point cloud samples using geometric morphological analysis and optimizes spatial discrepancy to reduce margin and increase overlap between normal and abnormal features.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on both IEC3D-AD and other datasets, showing improved performance in 3D anomaly detection for industrial equipment components.

Conclusion: The IEC3D-AD dataset addresses limitations of existing datasets and the GMANet method provides an effective 3D anomaly detection paradigm for real industrial scenarios, enabling more precise detection of subtle defects in industrial equipment components.

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection (3D-AD) plays a critical role in industrial
manufacturing, particularly in ensuring the reliability and safety of core
equipment components. Although existing 3D datasets like Real3D-AD and MVTec
3D-AD offer broad application support, they fall short in capturing the
complexities and subtle defects found in real industrial environments. This
limitation hampers precise anomaly detection research, especially for
industrial equipment components (IEC) such as bearings, rings, and bolts. To
address this challenge, we have developed a point cloud anomaly detection
dataset (IEC3D-AD) specific to real industrial scenarios. This dataset is
directly collected from actual production lines, ensuring high fidelity and
relevance. Compared to existing datasets, IEC3D-AD features significantly
improved point cloud resolution and defect annotation granularity, facilitating
more demanding anomaly detection tasks. Furthermore, inspired by generative
2D-AD methods, we introduce a novel 3D-AD paradigm (GMANet) on IEC3D-AD. This
paradigm generates synthetic point cloud samples based on geometric
morphological analysis, then reduces the margin and increases the overlap
between normal and abnormal point-level features through spatial discrepancy
optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on both IEC3D-AD and other datasets.

*Shuangquan Lyu,Steven Mao,Yue Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting using text-to-video diffusion models with LoRA fine-tuning and temporal co-denoising for seamless, high-fidelity long video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of generating long videos with high controllability in video inpainting and outpainting, which current methods struggle with due to fixed-length clips and stitching artifacts.

Method: Extends text-to-video diffusion models using LoRA to efficiently fine-tune pre-trained models like Wan 2.1 for masked region synthesis, with overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising strategy and high-order solvers for consistency.

Result: Enables arbitrarily long video generation without noticeable seams or drift, outperforming baseline methods (Wan 2.1, VACE) in quality metrics (PSNR/SSIM) and perceptual realism (LPIPS).

Conclusion: Achieves practical long-range video editing with minimal overhead, balancing parameter efficiency and superior performance for controllable video inpainting/outpainting.

Abstract: Generating long videos remains a fundamental challenge, and achieving high
controllability in video inpainting and outpainting is particularly demanding.
To address both of these challenges simultaneously and achieve controllable
video inpainting and outpainting for long video clips, we introduce a novel and
unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting that extends
text-to-video diffusion models to generate arbitrarily long, spatially edited
videos with high fidelity. Our method leverages LoRA to efficiently fine-tune a
large pre-trained video diffusion model like Alibaba's Wan 2.1 for masked
region video synthesis, and employs an overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising
strategy with high-order solvers to maintain consistency across long sequences.
In contrast to prior work that struggles with fixed-length clips or exhibits
stitching artifacts, our system enables arbitrarily long video generation and
editing without noticeable seams or drift. We validate our approach on
challenging inpainting/outpainting tasks including editing or adding objects
over hundreds of frames and demonstrate superior performance to baseline
methods like Wan 2.1 model and VACE in terms of quality (PSNR/SSIM), and
perceptual realism (LPIPS). Our method enables practical long-range video
editing with minimal overhead, achieved a balance between parameter efficient
and superior performance.

### [30] [Diffusion-SDPO: Safeguarded Direct Preference Optimization for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03317)
*Minghao Fu,Guo-Hua Wang,Tianyu Cui,Qing-Guo Chen,Zhao Xu,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-SDPO addresses limitations in diffusion-based DPO by introducing a safeguarded update rule that prevents degradation of preferred outputs during preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Diffusion-DPO can increase reconstruction errors for both preferred and less-preferred outputs, limiting alignment quality despite growing preference margins.

Method: Introduces Diffusion-SDPO with adaptive gradient scaling for the loser branch based on its alignment with the winner gradient, ensuring non-increasing error for preferred outputs.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods on text-to-image benchmarks across preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Diffusion-SDPO provides a simple, effective solution for stable preference learning in diffusion models while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models deliver high-quality images, yet aligning them
with human preferences remains challenging. We revisit diffusion-based Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) for these models and identify a critical
pathology: enlarging the preference margin does not necessarily improve
generation quality. In particular, the standard Diffusion-DPO objective can
increase the reconstruction error of both winner and loser branches.
Consequently, degradation of the less-preferred outputs can become sufficiently
severe that the preferred branch is also adversely affected even as the margin
grows. To address this, we introduce Diffusion-SDPO, a safeguarded update rule
that preserves the winner by adaptively scaling the loser gradient according to
its alignment with the winner gradient. A first-order analysis yields a
closed-form scaling coefficient that guarantees the error of the preferred
output is non-increasing at each optimization step. Our method is simple,
model-agnostic, broadly compatible with existing DPO-style alignment frameworks
and adds only marginal computational overhead. Across standard text-to-image
benchmarks, Diffusion-SDPO delivers consistent gains over preference-learning
baselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgViVQA is a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from static images to dynamic surgical scenes using temporal cues, outperforming existing methods on colonoscopic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical VideoQA approaches are limited to static image features and lack temporal annotations, ignoring critical dynamics for accurate procedural interpretation.

Method: Uses a Masked Video-Text Encoder to fuse video and question features capturing temporal cues, with a fine-tuned LLM decoding answers. Evaluated on REAL-Colon-VQA and EndoVis18-VQA datasets.

Result: Outperforms existing image-based VQA models, improving keyword accuracy by +11% on REAL-Colon-VQA and +9% on EndoVis18-VQA. Shows improved generalizability to question variations.

Conclusion: SurgViVQA provides a framework for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling better interpretation of dynamic procedural contexts.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) in the surgical domain aims to enhance
intraoperative understanding by enabling AI models to reason over temporally
coherent events rather than isolated frames. Current approaches are limited to
static image features, and available datasets often lack temporal annotations,
ignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation. We
propose SurgViVQA, a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from
static images to dynamic surgical scenes. It uses a Masked Video--Text Encoder
to fuse video and question features, capturing temporal cues such as motion and
tool--tissue interactions, which a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) then
decodes into coherent answers. To evaluate its performance, we curated
REAL-Colon-VQA, a colonoscopic video dataset that includes motion-related
questions and diagnostic attributes, as well as out-of-template questions with
rephrased or semantically altered formulations to assess model robustness.
Experimental validation on REAL-Colon-VQA and the public EndoVis18-VQA dataset
shows that SurgViVQA outperforms existing image-based VQA benchmark models,
particularly in keyword accuracy, improving over PitVQA by +11\% on
REAL-Colon-VQA and +9\% on EndoVis18-VQA. A perturbation study on the questions
further confirms improved generalizability and robustness to variations in
question phrasing. SurgViVQA and the REAL-Colon-VQA dataset provide a framework
for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to
interpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively. Code and dataset

Grounding (MOT25-StAG) Challenge. The aim of this challenge is to accurately
localize and track multiple objects that match specific and free-form language
queries, using video data of complex real-world scenes as input. We model the
underlying task as a video retrieval problem and present a two-stage, zero-shot
approach, combining the advantages of the SOTA tracking model FastTracker and
Multi-modal Large Language Model LLaVA-Video. On the MOT25-StAG test set, our
method achieves m-HIoU and HOTA scores of 20.68 and 10.73 respectively, which
won second place in the challenge.

*Guozhen Zhang,Zixiang Zhou,Teng Hu,Ziqiao Peng,Youliang Zhang,Yi Chen,Yuan Zhou,Qinglin Lu,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniAVGen is a unified framework for joint audio-video generation that addresses lip synchronization and semantic consistency issues through dual-branch diffusion transformers with cross-modal interaction mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source audio-video generation methods suffer from compromised lip synchronization and insufficient semantic consistency due to lack of effective cross-modal modeling.

Method: Uses dual-branch joint synthesis with parallel Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism for bidirectional cross-attention, Face-Aware Modulation for prioritizing salient regions, and Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance for enhanced cross-modal correlation.

Result: Achieves superior audio-video synchronization, timbre consistency, and emotion consistency with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs 30.1M) compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: UniAVGen provides a robust joint synthesis framework that unifies multiple audio-video tasks in a single model while delivering improved performance with reduced training data requirements.

Abstract: Due to the lack of effective cross-modal modeling, existing open-source
audio-video generation methods often exhibit compromised lip synchronization
and insufficient semantic consistency. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose
UniAVGen, a unified framework for joint audio and video generation. UniAVGen is
anchored in a dual-branch joint synthesis architecture, incorporating two
parallel Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to build a cohesive cross-modal latent
space. At its heart lies an Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism, which
enables bidirectional, temporally aligned cross-attention, thus ensuring
precise spatiotemporal synchronization and semantic consistency. Furthermore,
this cross-modal interaction is augmented by a Face-Aware Modulation module,
which dynamically prioritizes salient regions in the interaction process. To
enhance generative fidelity during inference, we additionally introduce
Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance, a novel strategy that explicitly
amplifies cross-modal correlation signals. Notably, UniAVGen's robust joint
synthesis design enables seamless unification of pivotal audio-video tasks
within a single model, such as joint audio-video generation and continuation,
video-to-audio dubbing, and audio-driven video synthesis. Comprehensive
experiments validate that, with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs. 30.1M),
UniAVGen delivers overall advantages in audio-video synchronization, timbre
consistency, and emotion consistency.

*Gahyeon Kim,Sohee Kim,Seokju Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AAPL improves prompt learning by using image augmentations with adversarial token embeddings to focus on class-relevant visual features, outperforming existing methods across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods struggle with generalization to unseen categories and lack guidance for learning semantically meaningful visual features, while image-based augmentation potential remains unexplored.

Method: AAPL introduces adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations from class-relevant semantic representations, enabling prompts to focus on visually discriminative features.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show AAPL consistently outperforms existing methods in few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and domain generalization settings.

Conclusion: Image-level augmentations with adversarial token embeddings effectively enhance prompt learning by focusing on semantically meaningful visual features, achieving superior generalization performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to
significant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and
CoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,
known as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these
models often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While
traditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data
augmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based
modifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely
unexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,
particularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support
and enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between
these augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to
improve generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such
as CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that
focus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose
Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces
adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations
introduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This
decoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually
discriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently
outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and
domain generalization settings. Our source code is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated method for standardizing embryo alignment in 3D ultrasound images using PCA to extract principal axes and multiple selection strategies to identify standard orientation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardized alignment facilitates prenatal growth monitoring, standard plane detection, and improves visualization of landmarks while accentuating differences between scans.

Method: PCA applied to embryo segmentation mask to extract principal axes, generating four candidate orientations. Three selection strategies: Pearson correlation heuristic, atlas-based image matching with normalized cross-correlation, and Random Forest classifier.

Result: Tested on 2166 3D ultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies (7+0 to 12+6 weeks). PCA correctly extracted principal axes in 99.0% of images. Selection accuracy: Pearson Heuristic 97.4%, Atlas-based 95.8%, Random Forest 98.4%, Majority Vote 98.5%.

Conclusion: High accuracy pipeline enables consistent embryonic alignment in first trimester, supporting scalable analysis in clinical and research settings. Code publicly available.

Abstract: Standardized alignment of the embryo in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound
images aids prenatal growth monitoring by facilitating standard plane
detection, improving visualization of landmarks and accentuating differences
between different scans. In this work, we propose an automated method for
standardizing this alignment. Given a segmentation mask of the embryo,
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the mask extracting the
embryo's principal axes, from which four candidate orientations are derived.
The candidate in standard orientation is selected using one of three
strategies: a heuristic based on Pearson's correlation assessing shape, image
matching to an atlas through normalized cross-correlation, and a Random Forest
classifier. We tested our method on 2166 images longitudinally acquired 3D
ultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies from the Rotterdam Periconceptional
Cohort, ranging from 7+0 to 12+6 weeks of gestational age. In 99.0% of images,
PCA correctly extracted the principal axes of the embryo. The correct candidate
was selected by the Pearson Heuristic, Atlas-based and Random Forest in 97.4%,
95.8%, and 98.4% of images, respectively. A Majority Vote of these selection
methods resulted in an accuracy of 98.5%. The high accuracy of this pipeline
enables consistent embryonic alignment in the first trimester, enabling
scalable analysis in both clinical and research settings. The code is publicly

*Kevin Manogue,Tomasz M Schang,Dilara Kuş,Jonas Müller,Stefan Zachow,Agniva Sengupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extension of Shape-from-Template (SfT) to handle topological changes like tears and cuts during 3D surface reconstruction from 2D images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SfT methods fail when topological changes occur during deformation, limiting practical applications where surfaces can tear or cut.

Method: Initialize with classical SfT solution, then iteratively adapt template by partitioning spatial domain to minimize energy functional combining physical plausibility and reprojection consistency.

Result: Method robustly captures topological events including tears and cuts on bounded 2D surfaces, outperforming baseline methods on synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: Establishes first general framework for topological-change-aware SfT, enabling reconstruction in presence of topological changes.

Abstract: Reconstructing the surfaces of deformable objects from correspondences
between a 3D template and a 2D image is well studied under Shape-from-Template
(SfT) methods; however, existing approaches break down when topological changes
accompany the deformation. We propose a principled extension of SfT that
enables reconstruction in the presence of such changes. Our approach is
initialized with a classical SfT solution and iteratively adapts the template
by partitioning its spatial domain so as to minimize an energy functional that
jointly encodes physical plausibility and reprojection consistency. We
demonstrate that the method robustly captures a wide range of practically
relevant topological events including tears and cuts on bounded 2D surfaces,
thereby establishing the first general framework for topological-change-aware
SfT. Experiments on both synthetic and real data confirm that our approach
consistently outperforms baseline methods.

TL;DR: Anny is a scan-free, differentiable human body model based on anthropometric knowledge that provides interpretable shape control across diverse demographics and supports various 3D human modeling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parametric body models rely on costly 3D scans and proprietary shape spaces that are demographically narrow, limiting accessibility and representativeness.

Method: Anny defines a continuous, interpretable shape space using phenotype parameters (gender, age, height, weight) to control blendshapes, calibrated with WHO population statistics for realistic demographic variation.

Result: Anny enables millimeter-accurate scan fitting, controlled synthetic data generation, and HMR training. Anny-One dataset of 800k photorealistic humans shows HMR models trained with Anny match scan-based model performance while being interpretable and representative.

Conclusion: Anny provides an accessible, open-source foundation for human-centric 3D modeling with semantic control and broad demographic representation, released under Apache 2.0 license.

Abstract: Parametric body models are central to many human-centric tasks, yet existing
models often rely on costly 3D scans and learned shape spaces that are
proprietary and demographically narrow. We introduce Anny, a simple, fully
differentiable, and scan-free human body model grounded in anthropometric
knowledge from the MakeHuman community. Anny defines a continuous,
interpretable shape space, where phenotype parameters (e.g. gender, age,
height, weight) control blendshapes spanning a wide range of human forms --
across ages (from infants to elders), body types, and proportions. Calibrated
using WHO population statistics, it provides realistic and demographically
grounded human shape variation within a single unified model. Thanks to its
openness and semantic control, Anny serves as a versatile foundation for 3D
human modeling -- supporting millimeter-accurate scan fitting, controlled
synthetic data generation, and Human Mesh Recovery (HMR). We further introduce
Anny-One, a collection of 800k photorealistic humans generated with Anny,
showing that despite its simplicity, HMR models trained with Anny can match the
performance of those trained with scan-based body models, while remaining
interpretable and broadly representative. The Anny body model and its code are
released under the Apache 2.0 license, making Anny an accessible foundation for

*Vittal L. Rao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes signal intensity-weighted coordinate representation that scales coordinate channels by local signal intensity, improving localization performance in biomedical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localization tasks in biomedical data require learning spatial/temporal relationships from signals with complex intensity distributions, and existing coordinate channel approaches don't consider signal intensity.

Method: Replace pure coordinate channels with channels scaled by local signal intensity, creating an intensity-position coupling in the input representation as a modality-agnostic inductive bias.

Result: Faster convergence and higher generalization performance on ECG signal transition timing prediction and nuclear center coordinate regression compared to conventional coordinate-channel approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed intensity-weighted coordinate representation is effective across 1D and 2D biomedical signals, providing better localization performance than standard coordinate channel methods.

Abstract: Localisation tasks in biomedical data often require models to learn
meaningful spatial or temporal relationships from signals with complex
intensity distributions. A common strategy, exemplified by CoordConv layers, is
to append coordinate channels to convolutional inputs, enabling networks to
learn absolute positions. In this work, we propose a signal intensity-weighted
coordinate representation that replaces the pure coordinate channels with
channels scaled by local signal intensity. This modification embeds an
intensity-position coupling directly in the input representation, introducing a
simple and modality-agnostic inductive bias. We evaluate the approach on two
distinct localisation problems: (i) predicting the time of morphological
transition in 20-second, two-lead ECG signals, and (ii) regressing the
coordinates of nuclear centres in cytological images from the SiPaKMeD dataset.
In both cases, the proposed representation yields faster convergence and higher
generalisation performance relative to conventional coordinate-channel
approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness across both one-dimensional and
two-dimensional biomedical signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy preservation in human monitoring systems, as conventional cameras capture identifiable information while event cameras only record pixel intensity changes.

Method: Lightweight 3D convolutional neural network with focal loss, class reweighting, and data augmentation strategies to handle class imbalance and enhance generalization.

Result: F1-score of 0.9415 and overall accuracy of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures (C3D, ResNet3D, MC3_18) by up to 3%.

Conclusion: Event-based deep learning enables accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware human action recognition systems suitable for real-world edge applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight three-dimensional convolutional neural
network (3DCNN) for human activity recognition (HAR) using event-based vision
data. Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as
conventional frame-based cameras capture identifiable personal information. In
contrast, event cameras record only changes in pixel intensity, providing an
inherently privacy-preserving sensing modality. The proposed network
effectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics while maintaining a
compact design suitable for edge deployment. To address class imbalance and
enhance generalization, focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data
augmentation strategies are employed. The model is trained and evaluated on a
composite dataset derived from the Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate an F1-score of 0.9415 and an overall accuracy
of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures such as C3D, ResNet3D,
and MC3_18 by up to 3%. These results highlight the potential of event-based

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A part-aware bottom-up framework for fine-grained social interaction detection that uses body part features and interpersonal relations to infer social groups, outperforming prior methods on the NVI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook nuanced social cues like facial expressions and gestures, relying instead on holistic representations and directly detecting groups without modeling underlying interactions, which limits their ability to capture localized social signals.

Method: A part-aware bottom-up group reasoning framework that detects individuals, enhances features using part-aware cues, and infers group configurations through similarity-based reasoning considering both spatial relations and subtle social cues.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NVI dataset, demonstrating superior group inference accuracy compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively captures fine-grained social interactions by modeling body part features and interpersonal relations, leading to more accurate social group detection.

Abstract: Social interactions often emerge from subtle, fine-grained cues such as
facial expressions, gaze, and gestures. However, existing methods for social
interaction detection overlook such nuanced cues and primarily rely on holistic
representations of individuals. Moreover, they directly detect social groups
without explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals.
These drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and
introduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social
interactions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware
bottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction
detection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions
using body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first
detects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then
infers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based
reasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social
cues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference.
Experiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior
methods, achieving the new state of the art.

*Jongseo Lee,Wooil Lee,Gyeong-Moon Park,Seong Tae Kim,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DANCE is a video action recognition framework that disentangles motion dynamics from spatial context using concept-based explanations, improving interpretability while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video explanation methods produce entangled explanations that don't clearly separate motion from spatial context, and language-based approaches struggle to explain tacit motions that are hard to verbalize.

Method: Uses disentangled concept types: motion dynamics (human pose sequences), objects, and scenes. Employs large language model to extract object/scene concepts automatically, built on ante-hoc concept bottleneck design that enforces prediction through these concepts.

Result: Demonstrated on four datasets (KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, UCF-101) with significantly improved explanation clarity and competitive performance. User study validated superior interpretability, and framework proved beneficial for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.

Conclusion: DANCE successfully addresses the disentanglement challenge in video action recognition explanations by separating motion dynamics from spatial context, providing clearer interpretability while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Effective explanations of video action recognition models should disentangle
how movements unfold over time from the surrounding spatial context. However,
existing methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it
unclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based
approaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit
nature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these
challenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based
Explainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions
through disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We
define motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large
language model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an
ante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these
concepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101
-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with
competitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE
through a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial
for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.

### [42] [AI-Enhanced Wi-Fi Sensing Through Single Transceiver Pair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02845)
*Yuxuan Liu,Chiya Zhang,Yifeng Yuan,Chunlong He,Weizheng Zhang,Gaojie Chen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: AI-driven Wi-Fi sensing systems can exceed traditional radar resolution limits through prior information and temporal correlation, enabling high-precision perception with minimal hardware requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical foundations of how AI enables Wi-Fi sensing systems to surpass traditional radar resolution limitations under hardware-constrained conditions.

Method: Developed an AI-based Wi-Fi sensing system using a single transceiver pair and conducted experiments on human pose estimation and indoor localization to validate theoretical claims about prior information and temporal correlation.

Result: Experimental results confirmed that performance gains in AI-based Wi-Fi sensing come from prior information (enabling plausible detail generation from vague inputs) and temporal correlation (reducing sensing error upper bound).

Conclusion: AI enhances Wi-Fi sensing performance primarily through leveraging prior information and temporal correlation, allowing systems to overcome traditional hardware limitations and achieve high-precision perception with minimal bandwidth and antenna requirements.

Abstract: The advancement of next-generation Wi-Fi technology heavily relies on sensing
capabilities, which play a pivotal role in enabling sophisticated applications.
In response to the growing demand for large-scale deployments, contemporary
Wi-Fi sensing systems strive to achieve high-precision perception while
maintaining minimal bandwidth consumption and antenna count requirements.
Remarkably, various AI-driven perception technologies have demonstrated the
ability to surpass the traditional resolution limitations imposed by radar
theory. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this phenomenon have not been
thoroughly investigated in existing research. In this study, we found that
under hardware-constrained conditions, the performance gains brought by AI to
Wi-Fi sensing systems primarily originate from two aspects: prior information
and temporal correlation. Prior information enables the AI to generate
plausible details based on vague input, while temporal correlation helps reduce
the upper bound of sensing error. We developed an AI-based Wi-Fi sensing system
using a single transceiver pair and designed experiments focusing on human pose
estimation and indoor localization to validate the theoretical claims. The
results confirm the performance gains contributed by temporal correlation and
prior information.

### [43] [Benchmarking ResNet for Short-Term Hypoglycemia Classification with DiaData](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02849)
*Beyza Cinar,Maria Maleshkova*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This study improves data quality for Type 1 Diabetes analysis by cleaning DiaData (15 datasets, 2510 subjects), using IQR for outlier detection, interpolation methods for missing values, and demonstrating improved hypoglycemia classification with quality-refined data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individualized therapy for Type 1 Diabetes requires reliable medical data analysis, but existing datasets suffer from outliers, noise, small volumes, and missing values that limit analysis quality.

Method: 1) Outlier detection using IQR approach with replacement by missing values; 2) Gap imputation: small gaps (≤25min) with linear interpolation, larger gaps (30-120min) with Stineman interpolation; 3) Correlation analysis between glucose and heart rate; 4) Hypoglycemia classification benchmark using ResNet model trained on quality-refined data.

Result: Stineman interpolation provides more realistic glucose estimates than linear interpolation for larger gaps. Moderate correlation found between glucose and heart rate 15-60 minutes before hypoglycemia. Quality-refined data yields 2-3% performance gain in hypoglycemia classification, and training with more data improves performance by 7%.

Conclusion: Data quality refinement significantly improves Type 1 Diabetes analysis reliability, with interpolation methods and outlier treatment enhancing dataset utility for predictive modeling and correlation studies.

Abstract: Individualized therapy is driven forward by medical data analysis, which
provides insight into the patient's context. In particular, for Type 1 Diabetes
(T1D), which is an autoimmune disease, relationships between demographics,
sensor data, and context can be analyzed. However, outliers, noisy data, and
small data volumes cannot provide a reliable analysis. Hence, the research
domain requires large volumes of high-quality data. Moreover, missing values
can lead to information loss. To address this limitation, this study improves
the data quality of DiaData, an integration of 15 separate datasets containing
glucose values from 2510 subjects with T1D. Notably, we make the following
contributions: 1) Outliers are identified with the interquartile range (IQR)
approach and treated by replacing them with missing values. 2) Small gaps
($\le$ 25 min) are imputed with linear interpolation and larger gaps ($\ge$ 30
and $<$ 120 min) with Stineman interpolation. Based on a visual comparison,
Stineman interpolation provides more realistic glucose estimates than linear
interpolation for larger gaps. 3) After data cleaning, the correlation between
glucose and heart rate is analyzed, yielding a moderate relation between 15 and
60 minutes before hypoglycemia ($\le$ 70 mg/dL). 4) Finally, a benchmark for
hypoglycemia classification is provided with a state-of-the-art ResNet model.
The model is trained with the Maindatabase and Subdatabase II of DiaData to
classify hypoglycemia onset up to 2 hours in advance. Training with more data
improves performance by 7% while using quality-refined data yields a 2-3% gain
compared to raw data.

### [44] [Spatio-Temporal Attention Network for Epileptic Seizure Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02846)
*Zan Li,Kyongmin Yeo,Wesley Gifford,Lara Marcuse,Madeline Fields,Bülent Yener*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A deep learning framework using Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (STAN) for EEG-based seizure prediction, achieving high sensitivity with low false detection rates and providing 15-45 minute early warnings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing seizure prediction methods rely on feature engineering and assume fixed preictal durations, lacking patient-specific learning and accurate spatio-temporal modeling of EEG signals.

Method: Uses Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (STAN) to model complex spatio-temporal correlations in EEG signals, combined with an adversarial discriminator to distinguish preictal from interictal attention patterns for patient-specific learning.

Result: Achieved 96.6% sensitivity with 0.011/h false detection rate on CHB-MIT dataset and 94.2% sensitivity with 0.063/h FDR on MSSM dataset, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The framework reliably detects preictal states 15-45 minutes before seizure onset, providing sufficient intervention time for clinical applications and demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: In this study, we present a deep learning framework that learns complex
spatio-temporal correlation structures of EEG signals through a Spatio-Temporal
Attention Network (STAN) for accurate predictions of onset of seizures for
Epilepsy patients. Unlike existing methods, which rely on feature engineering
and/or assume fixed preictal durations, our approach simultaneously models
spatio-temporal correlations through STAN and employs an adversarial
discriminator to distinguish preictal from interictal attention patterns,
enabling patient-specific learning. Evaluation on CHB-MIT and MSSM datasets
demonstrates 96.6\% sensitivity with 0.011/h false detection rate on CHB-MIT,
and 94.2% sensitivity with 0.063/h FDR on MSSM, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. The framework reliably detects preictal states at
least 15 minutes before an onset, with patient-specific windows extending to 45
minutes, providing sufficient intervention time for clinical applications.

### [45] [NEF-NET+: Adapting Electrocardio panorama in the wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02880)
*Zehui Zhan,Yaojun Hu,Jiajing Zhan,Wanchen Lian,Wanqing Wu,Jintai Chen*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: NEF-NET+ is an enhanced framework for panoramic ECG synthesis that reconstructs continuous electrocardiac fields, enabling virtual ECG observation from arbitrary viewpoints with improved robustness to real-world challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard multi-lead ECG systems have fixed anatomical viewpoints, which may miss diagnostically critical patterns in certain cardiac conditions. Nef-Net was limited by idealized assumptions and real-world challenges like long-duration modeling, device artifacts, and suboptimal lead placement.

Method: Uses a newly designed model architecture for direct view transformation, incorporating offline pretraining, device calibration tuning, and on-the-fly patient-specific adaptation steps to support arbitrary-length signal synthesis from any view.

Result: NEF-NET+ shows substantial improvements over Nef-Net, achieving around 6 dB increase in PSNR in real-world settings. A new benchmark (Panobench) with 5367 recordings and 48-view per subject was created for evaluation.

Conclusion: NEF-NET+ successfully addresses real-world challenges in panoramic ECG synthesis, providing robust performance across devices and compensating for electrode placement deviations, enabling more comprehensive cardiac diagnosis.

Abstract: Conventional multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) systems capture cardiac
signals from a fixed set of anatomical viewpoints defined by lead placement.
However, certain cardiac conditions (e.g., Brugada syndrome) require
additional, non-standard viewpoints to reveal diagnostically critical patterns
that may be absent in standard leads. To systematically overcome this
limitation, Nef-Net was recently introduced to reconstruct a continuous
electrocardiac field, enabling virtual observation of ECG signals from
arbitrary views (termed Electrocardio Panorama). Despite its promise, Nef-Net
operates under idealized assumptions and faces in-the-wild challenges, such as
long-duration ECG modeling, robustness to device-specific signal artifacts, and
suboptimal lead placement calibration. This paper presents NEF-NET+, an
enhanced framework for realistic panoramic ECG synthesis that supports
arbitrary-length signal synthesis from any desired view, generalizes across ECG
devices, and com- pensates for operator-induced deviations in electrode
placement. These capabilities are enabled by a newly designed model
architecture that performs direct view transformation, incorporating a workflow
comprising offline pretraining, device calibration tuning steps as well as an
on-the-fly calibration step for patient-specific adaptation. To rigorously
evaluate panoramic ECG synthesis, we construct a new Electrocardio Panorama
benchmark, called Panobench, comprising 5367 recordings with 48-view per
subject, capturing the full spatial variability of cardiac electrical activity.
Experimental results show that NEF-NET+ delivers substantial improvements over
Nef-Net, yielding an increase of around 6 dB in PSNR in real-world setting. The
code and Panobench will be released in a subsequent publication.

### [46] [EEGReXferNet: A Lightweight Gen-AI Framework for EEG Subspace Reconstruction via Cross-Subject Transfer Learning and Channel-Aware Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02848)
*Shantanu Sarkar,Piotr Nabrzyski,Saurabh Prasad,Jose Luis Contreras-Vidal*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: EEGReXferNet is a lightweight Gen-AI framework for EEG signal reconstruction that addresses noise and artifact issues through cross-subject transfer learning, improving spatial-temporal-spectral resolution while reducing computational complexity for real-time BCI applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEG artifact removal methods require manual intervention or risk suppressing neural features, and existing generative models lack integrated temporal-spectral-spatial sensitivity while being computationally intensive for real-time use.

Method: EEGReXferNet uses a modular architecture with volume conduction across channels, band-specific convolution encoding, dynamic latent feature extraction via sliding windows, and reference-based scaling for continuity across subjects.

Result: The framework achieves mean PSD correlation >= 0.95, mean spectrogram RV-Coefficient >= 0.85, reduces total weights by ~45% to prevent overfitting, and maintains computational efficiency for real-time processing.

Conclusion: EEGReXferNet provides a robust, efficient solution for real-time EEG preprocessing that generalizes well across subjects while improving signal quality for neurophysiological and BCI applications.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used non-invasive technique for
monitoring brain activity, but low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) due to various
artifacts often compromise its utility. Conventional artifact removal methods
require manual intervention or risk suppressing critical neural features during
filtering/reconstruction. Recent advances in generative models, including
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
have shown promise for EEG reconstruction; however, these approaches often lack
integrated temporal-spectral-spatial sensitivity and are computationally
intensive, limiting their suitability for real-time applications like
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). To overcome these challenges, we introduce
EEGReXferNet, a lightweight Gen-AI framework for EEG subspace reconstruction
via cross-subject transfer learning - developed using Keras TensorFlow
(v2.15.1). EEGReXferNet employs a modular architecture that leverages volume
conduction across neighboring channels, band-specific convolution encoding, and
dynamic latent feature extraction through sliding windows. By integrating
reference-based scaling, the framework ensures continuity across successive
windows and generalizes effectively across subjects. This design improves
spatial-temporal-spectral resolution (mean PSD correlation >= 0.95; mean
spectrogram RV-Coefficient >= 0.85), reduces total weights by ~45% to mitigate
overfitting, and maintains computational efficiency for robust, real-time EEG
preprocessing in neurophysiological and BCI applications.

*Youssif Abuzied,Hassan AbdEltawab,Abdelrhman Gaber,Tamer ElBatt*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: ECGXtract is a deep learning method for interpretable ECG feature extraction that outperforms traditional approaches and achieves strong correlation with clinical ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional signal processing and black-box machine learning methods for ECG analysis by developing interpretable feature extraction.

Method: Develop convolutional neural network models trained to extract single features initially, then explore multi-feature extraction with semantic grouping strategies.

Result: Achieves mean correlation of 0.80 for global features and 0.822 for lead-specific features, outperforming ECGdeli in 90% of features. Lead II provides best results.

Conclusion: Structured grouping strategies can balance computational efficiency and accuracy, enabling scalable and clinically interpretable ECG feature extraction for resource-limited settings.

Abstract: This paper presents ECGXtract, a deep learning-based approach for
interpretable ECG feature extraction, addressing the limitations of traditional
signal processing and black-box machine learning methods. In particular, we
develop convolutional neural network models capable of extracting both temporal
and morphological features with strong correlations to a clinically validated
ground truth. Initially, each model is trained to extract a single feature,
ensuring precise and interpretable outputs. A series of experiments is then
carried out to evaluate the proposed method across multiple setups, including
global versus lead-specific features, different sampling frequencies, and
comparisons with other approaches such as ECGdeli. Our findings show that
ECGXtract achieves robust performance across most features with a mean
correlation score of 0.80 with the ground truth for global features, with lead
II consistently providing the best results. For lead-specific features,
ECGXtract achieves a mean correlation score of 0.822. Moreover, ECGXtract
achieves superior results to the state-of-the-art open source ECGdeli as it got
a higher correlation score with the ground truth in 90% of the features.
Furthermore, we explore the feasibility of extracting multiple features
simultaneously utilizing a single model. Semantic grouping is proved to be
effective for global features, while large-scale grouping and lead-specific
multi-output models show notable performance drops. These results highlight the
potential of structured grouping strategies to balance the computational
efficiency vs. model accuracy, paving the way for more scalable and clinically
interpretable ECG feature extraction systems in limited resource settings.

TL;DR: LiteHeart is a semi-supervised knowledge distillation framework that bridges the performance gap between low-cost and high-cost cardiac AI systems using wearable ECG data, improving diagnostic accuracy for cardiovascular diseases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advanced cardiac AI faces deployment challenges due to reliance on extensive medical data and high computational resources. Low-cost alternatives using wearable ECG data suffer from significant performance gaps compared to high-cost systems.

Method: Proposes LiteHeart with region-aware distillation module (mimicking cardiologists' focus on diagnostically relevant ECG regions) and cross-layer mutual information module (aligning decision processes). Uses semi-supervised training strategy to improve robustness under limited supervision.

Result: Evaluated on five datasets covering over 38 cardiovascular diseases, LiteHeart reduces performance gap between low-cost and high-cost systems, outperforming existing methods by 4.27% to 7.10% in macro F1 score.

Conclusion: LiteHeart significantly enhances diagnostic capabilities of low-cost cardiac intelligence systems, enabling scalable, affordable, and accurate daily cardiac healthcare using wearable technologies.

Abstract: Deploying advanced cardiac artificial intelligence for daily cardiac
monitoring is hindered by its reliance on extensive medical data and high
computational resources. Low-cost cardiac intelligence (LCCI) offers a
promising alternative by using wearable device data, such as 1-lead
electrocardiogram (ECG), but it suffers from a significant diagnostic
performance gap compared to high-cost cardiac intelligence (HCCI). To bridge
this gap, we propose LiteHeart, a semi-supervised knowledge distillation
framework. LiteHeart introduces a region-aware distillation module to mimic how
cardiologists focus on diagnostically relevant ECG regions and a cross-layer
mutual information module to align the decision processes of LCCI and HCCI
systems. Using a semi-supervised training strategy, LiteHeart further improves
model robustness under limited supervision. Evaluated on five datasets covering
over 38 cardiovascular diseases, LiteHeart substantially reduces the
performance gap between LCCI and HCCI, outperforming existing methods by 4.27%
to 7.10% in macro F1 score. These results demonstrate that LiteHeart
significantly enhances the diagnostic capabilities of low-cost cardiac
intelligence systems, paving the way for scalable, affordable, and accurate
daily cardiac healthcare using wearable technologies.

### [49] [Real-Time Interactive Hybrid Ocean: Spectrum-Consistent Wave Particle-FFT Coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02852)
*Shengze Xue,Yu Ren,Jiacheng Hong,Run Ni,Shuangjiu Xiao,Deli Dong*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A hybrid ocean model combining global FFT spectral background with local wave-particle patches for real-time interactive simulations, achieving both large-scale realism and fine-grained interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FFT spectral oceans are efficient but assume global stationarity and can't represent non-uniform seas or near-field interactions. Wave particles capture local details but are costly at scale and hard to match global statistics.

Method: Couple global FFT background with local wave-particle patches under unified spectral parameters and dispersion. Use frequency-bucketed particle sampling and GPU-parallel synthesis for spectral energy consistency.

Result: Achieves large-scale spectral consistency while supporting localized wakes and ripples, with real-time interactive performance through GPU acceleration.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework successfully delivers both large-scale spectral realism and fine-grained interactivity in real time by unifying FFT and wave-particle approaches.

Abstract: Fast Fourier Transform-based (FFT) spectral oceans are widely adopted for
their efficiency and large-scale realism, but they assume global stationarity
and spatial homogeneity, making it difficult to represent non-uniform seas and
near-field interactions (e.g., ships and floaters). In contrast, wave particles
capture local wakes and ripples, yet are costly to maintain at scale and hard
to match global spectral statistics.We present a real-time interactive hybrid
ocean: a global FFT background coupled with local wave-particle (WP) patch
regions around interactive objects, jointly driven under a unified set of
spectral parameters and dispersion. At patch boundaries, particles are injected
according to the same directional spectrum as the FFT, aligning the local
frequency-direction distribution with the background and matching energy
density, without disturbing the far field.Our approach introduces two main
innovations: (1) Hybrid ocean representation. We couple a global FFT background
with local WP patches under a unified spectrum, achieving large-scale spectral
consistency while supporting localized wakes and ripples.(2) Frequency-bucketed
implementation. We design a particle sampling and GPU-parallel synthesis scheme
based on frequency buckets, which preserves spectral energy consistency and
sustains real-time interactive performance.Together, these innovations enable a
unified framework that delivers both large-scale spectral realism and
fine-grained interactivity in real time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG-based conscious state estimation faces challenges with noise sensitivity and controlled environment requirements. ECG offers a non-invasive, reliable alternative better suited for dynamic clinical settings.

Method: Uses a transformer with decoupled query attention to capture heart rate variability features from ECG signals that distinguish between conscious and unconscious states.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 0.877 on sleep staging and 0.880 on anesthesia level monitoring, with highest AUC values of 0.786 and 0.895 respectively, outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: ECG-based consciousness monitoring provides a practical and robust alternative to EEG methods, enhancing patient safety and advancing understanding of conscious states in clinical environments.

Abstract: Conscious state estimation is important in various medical settings,
including sleep staging and anesthesia management, to ensure patient safety and
optimize health outcomes. Traditional methods predominantly utilize
electroencephalography (EEG), which faces challenges such as high sensitivity
to noise and the requirement for controlled environments. In this study, we
propose the consciousness-ECG transformer that leverages electrocardiography
(ECG) signals for non-invasive and reliable conscious state estimation. Our
approach employs a transformer with decoupled query attention to effectively
capture heart rate variability features that distinguish between conscious and
unconscious states. We implemented the conscious state estimation system with
real-time monitoring and validated our system on datasets involving sleep
staging and anesthesia level monitoring during surgeries. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline models, achieving accuracies of
0.877 on sleep staging and 0.880 on anesthesia level monitoring. Moreover, our
model achieves the highest area under curve values of 0.786 and 0.895 on sleep
staging and anesthesia level monitoring, respectively. The proposed system
offers a practical and robust alternative to EEG-based methods, particularly
suited for dynamic clinical environments. Our results highlight the potential
of ECG-based consciousness monitoring to enhance patient safety and advance our
understanding of conscious states.

Result: Reduces Pearson correlation between IF signal amplitude and internal temperature drift by up to 84%, demonstrating improved robustness across various temperature conditions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully mitigates temperature drift effects while ensuring scalability in dense networks and incorporates ethical design principles by avoiding sensitive external data.

Abstract: We present a novel internal calibration framework for Millimeter- Wave
(mmWave) Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radars to ensure robust
performance under internal temperature variations, tailored for deployment in
dense wireless networks. Our approach mitigates the impact of
temperature-induced drifts in radar hardware, enhancing reliability. We propose
a temperature compensation model that leverages internal sensor data and signal
processing techniques to maintain measurement accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate improved robustness across a range of internal temperature
conditions, with minimal computational overhead, ensuring scalability in dense

principles, avoiding reliance on sensitive external data. The proposed scheme
reduces the Pearson correlation between the amplitude of the Intermediate

mitigating the temperature drift.

### [52] [From Narrow to Wide: Autoencoding Transformers for Ultrasound Bandwidth Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02938)
*Sepideh KhakzadGharamaleki,Hassan Rivaz,Brandon Helfield*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A deep learning method that enhances narrow-band ultrasound images to broadband quality using a ViT auto-encoder, achieving significant image quality improvements without hardware changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-cost ultrasound probes with narrow bandwidths produce elongated pulses that lose high-frequency detail, limiting image resolution in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Train a Tiny Vision Transformer auto-encoder on simulation data using curriculum-weighted loss to map band-limited RF spectrograms to broadband versions.

Result: 90% reduction in image-domain MSE, 6.7 dB PSNR boost, SSIM of 0.965 on phantoms; maintains frame rate and phase information with strong out-of-distribution generalization.

Conclusion: Software-only upgrade can give narrow-band probes broadband-like performance, potentially expanding access to high-resolution ultrasound in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Conventional pulse-echo ultrasound suffers when low-cost probes deliver only
narrow fractional bandwidths, elongating pulses and erasing high-frequency
detail. We address this limitation by learning a data-driven mapping from
band-limited to broadband spectrogram of radio-frequency (RF) lines. To this
end, a variation of Tiny Vision Transform (ViT) auto-encoder is trained on
simulation data using a curriculum-weighted loss. On heterogeneous speckle-cyst
phantoms, the network reduces image-domain MSE by 90 percent, boosts PSNR by
6.7 dB, and raises SSIM to 0.965 compared with the narrow-band input. It also
sharpens point-target rows in a completely unseen resolution phantom,
demonstrating strong out-of-distribution generalisation without sacrificing
frame rate or phase information. These results indicate that a purely software
upgrade can endow installed narrow-band probes with broadband-like performance,
potentially widening access to high-resolution ultrasound in
resource-constrained settings.

### [53] [Consensus Tracking of an Underwater Vehicle Using Weighted Harmonic Mean Density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03130)
*Ved Prakash Dubey,Shovan Bhaumik*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes a weighted harmonic mean density (HMD) based tracking method for distributed underwater target tracking using sonobuoy sensors, with optimal weights derived by minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of distributed underwater target tracking where multiple sonobuoy sensors measure bearing angles and local trackers need to reach consensus on target estimates.

Method: Uses weighted harmonic mean density (HMD) for consensus tracking, with optimal weights assigned by minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence to fuse Gaussian densities across distributed trackers.

Result: Simulation results show the optimized HMD-based fusion outperforms existing fusion methods in distributed tracking, measured by root mean square error, track divergence percentage, and normalized estimation error squared.

Conclusion: The proposed HMD-based fusion with optimized weights provides superior performance for distributed underwater target tracking compared to existing methods.

Abstract: This paper addresses an underwater target tracking problem in which a large
number of sonobuoy sensors are deployed on a surveillance region. The region is
divided into several sub-regions, where a single tracker, capable of generating
track is installed. Each sonobuoy can measure the direction of arrival of
acoustic signals (known as bearing angles) and communicate the measurements
with the local tracker. Further, each local tracker can communicate with all
other trackers, where each of them can exchange their estimate and finally a
consensus is reached. We propose a weighted harmonic mean density (HMD) based
tracking to reach a consensus and provide a solution for the fusion of Gaussian
densities. In this approach, optimal weights are assigned by minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. Performance of the proposed method is
measured using root mean square error, percentage of track divergence, and
normalized estimation error squared. Simulation results demonstrate that the
optimized HMD-based fusion outperforms existing fusion methods during a
distributed tracking.

*Ziheng Zhang,Wen Chen,Qingqing Wu,Haoran Qin,Zhendong Li,Qiong Wu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-IRS collaborative hybrid localization system using joint time delay and angle estimation, with efficient algorithms achieving near-CRB performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve target localization accuracy by deploying multiple IRSs near target areas and leveraging collaborative signal processing for enhanced parameter estimation.

Method: Uses Fisher Information Matrix analysis, atomic norm minimization with ADMM for angle estimation, and a three-stage localization algorithm combining weighted least squares, total least squares, and quadratic correction.

Result: Numerical simulations show superior performance with substantial benefits from system collaboration, hybrid localization, and distributed deployment, especially in low SNR conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-IRS collaborative system with efficient estimation algorithms provides accurate target localization close to theoretical bounds, demonstrating practical advantages in challenging environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs)
collaborative hybrid localization system, which involves deploying multiple
IRSs near the target area and achieving target localization through joint time
delay and angle estimation. Specifically, echo signals from all reflective
elements are received by each sensor and jointly processed to estimate the time
delay and angle parameters. Based on the above model, we derive the Fisher
Information Matrix (FIM) for cascaded delay, Angle of Arrival (AOA), and Angle
of Departure (AOD) estimation in semi passive passive models, along with the
corresponding Cramer Rao Bound (CRB). To achieve precise estimation close to
the CRB, we design efficient algorithms for angle and location estimation. For
angle estimation, reflective signals are categorized into three cases based on
their rank, with different signal preprocessing. By constructing an atomic norm
set and minimizing the atomic norm, the joint angle estimation problem is
transformed into a convex optimization problem, and low-complexity estimation
of multiple AOA and AOD pairs is achieved using the Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM). For location estimation, we propose a three-stage
localization algorithm that combines weighted least squares, total least
squares, and quadratic correction to handle errors in the coefficient matrix
and observation vector, thus improving accuracy. Numerical simulations validate
the superiority of the proposed system, demonstrating that the system's
collaboration, hybrid localization, and distributed deployment provide
substantial benefits, as well as the accuracy of the proposed estimation
algorithms, particularly in low signal to noise ratio (SNR) condition.

*Zhiyuan Zhai,Wei Ni,Xin Wang,Dusit Niyato,Ekram Hossain*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Decentralized optimization framework using consensus ADMM for UAV swarm positioning to optimize ISAC performance by balancing communication rate and sensing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV swarms can form virtual antenna arrays for enhanced ISAC, but position optimization is challenging due to distributed nature and lack of global view at individual UAVs.

Method: Developed decentralized consensus ADMM algorithm that decomposes global objective into local projection updates, proxy-assisted consensus coordination, and lightweight dual updates for parallel decision-making and consensus.

Result: Proposed algorithm converges rapidly with strong scalability, and UAV swarm significantly outperforms fixed-array baselines in both communication and sensing performance.

Conclusion: The decentralized framework enables UAVs to reach consensus on globally optimal swarm geometry for ISAC, providing scalable and consistent optimization across the distributed swarm.

Abstract: UAV swarms can form virtual antenna arrays to exploit additional spatial
degrees of freedom and enhance integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). The
optimization of UAV positions is challenging due to the distributed nature of
swarms and the lack of a global view at individual UAVs.
  This paper presents a new decentralized optimization framework that allows
UAVs to decide their locations in parallel and reach consensus on a globally
optimal swarm geometry for ISAC.
  Specifically, we derive the achievable uplink rate and Cram\'er-Rao Bound
(CRB) as tractable metrics for communication and sensing, respectively.
  The UAV positions are optimized to balance maximizing the communication rate
and minimizing the CRB.
  To solve this non-convex problem with coupled variables, we develop a
decentralized consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm, which enables the UAVs to iteratively align their local updates and
reach consensus.
  The algorithm decomposes the global objective into local projection updates,
proxy-assisted consensus coordination, and lightweight dual updates, ensuring
scalability and consistency throughout the swarm.
  Simulations demonstrate that the proposed consensus ADMM algorithm converges
rapidly with strong scalability, and that the UAV swarm significantly
outperforms fixed-array baselines in both communication and sensing
performance.

### [57] [Decentralized Federated Learning with Distributed Aggregation Weight Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03284)
*Zhiyuan Zhai,Xiaojun Yuan,Xin Wang,Geoffrey Ye Li*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes a distributed aggregation weight optimization algorithm for decentralized federated learning that eliminates the need for a central entity by using local D2D communications to optimize mixing weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DFL systems rely on central entities to optimize aggregation weights, which contradicts the decentralized nature of DFL and creates communication bottlenecks.

Method: Developed a distributed subgradient-based algorithm that transforms the weight optimization into an eigenvalue problem, allowing edge devices to compute optimal weights using only local information and D2D communications.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves superior learning performance compared to conventional methods while maintaining full decentralization throughout the optimization, communication, and learning processes.

Conclusion: Enables genuinely distributed DFL systems where all components (optimization, communication, learning) operate in a fully decentralized manner using only local D2D communications.

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is an emerging paradigm to enable edge
devices collaboratively training a learning model using a device-to-device
(D2D) communication manner without the coordination of a parameter server (PS).
Aggregation weights, also known as mixing weights, are crucial in DFL process,
and impact the learning efficiency and accuracy. Conventional design relies on
a so-called central entity to collect all local information and conduct system
optimization to obtain appropriate weights. In this paper, we develop a
distributed aggregation weight optimization algorithm to align with the
decentralized nature of DFL. We analyze convergence by quantitatively capturing
the impact of the aggregation weights over decentralized communication
networks. Based on the analysis, we then formulate a learning performance
optimization problem by designing the aggregation weights to minimize the
derived convergence bound. The optimization problem is further transformed as
an eigenvalue optimization problem and solved by our proposed subgradient-based
algorithm in a distributed fashion. In our algorithm, edge devices only need
local information to obtain the optimal aggregation weights through local (D2D)
communications, just like the learning itself. Therefore, the optimization,
communication, and learning process can be all conducted in a distributed
fashion, which leads to a genuinely distributed DFL system. Numerical results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in practical DFL
deployment.

*Jinhao Yi,Weijun Gao,Chong Han*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: AI-empowered THz air-ground communication framework that models turbulence-induced attenuation using fluid dynamics and optimizes power and aircraft attitude for maximum link capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies overlook turbulence-induced propagation loss in high-mobility air-ground scenarios, which significantly impacts THz communications performance.

Method: Established fluid-dynamics-informed attenuation model for aircraft-generated turbulence, formulated joint power-attitude optimization problem, and solved it using diffusion-based algorithm that learns nonlinear relationship between flight configuration and turbulence attenuation.

Result: Turbulence-induced attenuation ranges from 18-28 dB at 0.7 Mach, and the framework achieves average capacity of 11.241 bps/Hz, outperforming existing strategies by 22.8-66.5% and reaching ~98% of theoretical capacity limit.

Conclusion: The proposed AI-empowered framework effectively addresses turbulence-induced attenuation in THz air-ground communications and significantly enhances communication performance through adaptive optimization.

Abstract: The ever-increasing demand for ultra-high data rates in space-air-ground
integrated networks (SAGINs) has rendered terahertz THz communications a
promising technology owing to its exceptionally broad and continuous spectrum
resources. Nevertheless, in air-ground (AG) scenarios, the high mobility of
aircraft induces intense and rapidly fluctuating turbulence, leading to
additional propagation loss that is often overlooked in existing studies. To
bridge this gap, this paper presents an AI-empowered THz AG communication
framework that explicitly models turbulence-induced attenuation through fluid
dynamics and integrates it into an adaptive optimization paradigm for
communication performance enhancement. Specifically, a fluid-dynamics-informed
attenuation model is established to characterize aircraft-generated turbulence
and quantify its impact on THz signal propagation. Building upon this model, a
joint power-attitude optimization problem is formulated to adaptively allocate
transmit power and adjust aircraft attitude for maximizing link capacity. The
optimization problem is efficiently solved using a diffusion-based algorithm
that learns the nonlinear relationship between flight configuration and
turbulence-induced attenuation. Comprehensive numerical evaluations demonstrate
that the turbulence-induced attenuation ranges from 18 to 28 dB under attacking
angles between -10 degree and 10 degree at 0.7 Mach, verifying the pronounced
impact of aircraft-induced turbulence on THz propagation. Furthermore, the
proposed framework attains an average capacity of 11.241 bps/Hz, substantially
outperforming existing strategies by 22.8% and 66.5%, and approaching
approximately 98% of the theoretical capacity limit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized machine learning in large-scale networks is sensitive to unreliable communication and time-varying topologies, which impact convergence performance. Understanding and optimizing the spectral properties of the mixing process can enhance learning efficiency in such environments.

Method: The authors formulate a spectral optimization problem to minimize the spectral radius of the expected second-order mixing matrix. They design a subgradient-based algorithm with Chebyshev-accelerated eigenvector estimation, local update, and aggregation weight adjustment while maintaining symmetry and stochasticity constraints.

Result: Experiments on a realistic LEO satellite constellation with time-varying link models and real-world remote sensing data show the method significantly improves classification accuracy and convergence efficiency compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed spectral optimization approach effectively enhances decentralized machine learning performance in unreliable communication environments, demonstrating practical applicability in satellite systems and other decentralized networks.

Abstract: Decentralized machine learning (DML) supports collaborative training in
large-scale networks with no central server. It is sensitive to the quality and
reliability of inter-device communications that result in time-varying and
stochastic topologies. This paper studies the impact of unreliable
communication on the convergence of DML and establishes a direct connection
between the spectral properties of the mixing process and the global
performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under random topologies
and derive bounds that characterize the impact of the expected mixing matrix's
spectral properties on learning. We formulate a spectral optimization problem
that minimizes the spectral radius of the expected second-order mixing matrix
to enhance the convergence rate under probabilistic link failures. To solve
this non-smooth spectral problem in a fully decentralized manner, we design an
efficient subgradient-based algorithm that integrates Chebyshev-accelerated
eigenvector estimation with local update and aggregation weight adjustment,
while ensuring symmetry and stochasticity constraints without central
coordination. Experiments on a realistic low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite
constellation with time-varying inter-satellite link models and real-world
remote sensing data demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the
proposed method. The method significantly improves classification accuracy and
convergence efficiency compared to existing baselines, validating its

Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) has significant potential
for future wireless systems, enabling efficient spectrum utilization and novel

for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging by leveraging orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) communication signals. We address the challenge of
severe imaging degradation in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments under the
QUAsi Deterministic RadIo channel GenerAtor (QuaDRiGa). To detect weak signals
and eliminate false points, we develop a two-stage compressed sensing-space
alternating generalized expectation maximization (CS-SAGE) scheme for
high-precision scatterer localization. In stage I, orthogonal matching pursuit
(OMP) is employed for coarse estimation to identify the approximate locations
of dominant scatterers. Then, the SAGE algorithm in stage II performs fine

validate the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative ISAC framework, and
provide valuable insights for practical system design.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Wireless-powered pinching antenna system (PAS) enhances communication reliability by adjusting antenna position to establish strong LoS links, with analysis showing optimal deployment parameters for minimizing outage probability and maximizing ergodic rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the advantages of pinching antenna in improving wireless-powered communication system performance by establishing strong line-of-sight links and reducing free-space path loss.

Method: Derived closed-form expressions of outage probability and ergodic rate for both lossy and lossless waveguide cases, analyzed optimal deployment of waveguides and users, and compared performance with traditional WPC systems.

Result: Wireless-powered PAS performance depends on absorption coefficient and waveguide length - high absorption and long waveguides increase outage probability but improve ergodic rate compared to traditional WPC. Optimal time allocation and PS-AP distance exist for performance optimization.

Conclusion: Wireless-powered PAS offers performance advantages over traditional systems when optimally deployed, with separated PS and AP configuration outperforming integrated hybrid access points, providing valuable deployment guidance for practical implementations.

Abstract: Pinching antenna system (PAS) serves as a groundbreaking paradigm that
enhances wireless communications by flexibly adjusting the position of pinching
antenna (PA) and establishing a strong line-of-sight (LoS) link, thereby
reducing the free-space path loss. This paper introduces the concept of
wireless-powered PAS, and investigates the reliability of wireless-powered PAS
to explore the advantages of PA in improving the performance of
wireless-powered communication (WPC) system. In addition, we derive the
closed-form expressions of outage probability and ergodic rate for the
practical lossy waveguide case and ideal lossless waveguide case, respectively,
and analyze the optimal deployment of waveguides and user to provide valuable
insights for guiding their deployments. The results show that an increase in
the absorption coefficient and in the dimensions of the user area leads to
higher in-waveguide and free-space propagation losses, respectively, which in
turn increase the outage probability and reduce the ergodic rate of the
wireless-powered PAS. However, the performance of wireless-powered PAS is
severely affected by the absorption coefficient and the waveguide length, e.g.,
under conditions of high absorption coefficient and long waveguide, the outage
probability of wireless-powered PAS is even worse than that of traditional WPC
system. While the ergodic rate of wireless-powered PAS is better than that of
traditional WPC system under conditions of high absorption coefficient and long
waveguide. Interestingly, the wireless-powered PAS has the optimal time
allocation factor and optimal distance between power station (PS) and access
point (AP) to minimize the outage probability or maximize the ergodic rate.
Moreover, the system performance of PS and AP separated at the optimal distance
between PS and AP is superior to that of PS and AP integrated into a hybrid
access point.

TL;DR: A modified OFDM waveform that reduces implementation costs of spectral shaping techniques by up to 50% in optimization coefficients and computational products.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OFDM suffers from high out-of-band emissions, and existing spectral shaping methods like precoding and AIC require costly optimization procedures and real-time implementation.

Method: Proposes a modification to the conventional OFDM waveform that reduces the computational complexity of spectral shaping techniques.

Result: The approach reduces both the number of optimization coefficients and computational products by up to 50% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: This modified OFDM waveform framework enables cost reduction for spectral shaping techniques and provides a foundation for future research to benefit from similar efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a widespread modulation
but suffers from high out-of-band emissions (OOBE). Spectral shaping strategies
such as precoding, active interference cancellation (AIC) and time-domain
methods are effective at reducing the OOBE but entail optimization procedures
and real-time implementation costs which might be considerable. This letter
proposes a modification of the conventional OFDM waveform aimed at reducing the
cost associated to many of the state-of-theart spectral shaping techniques and
sets a framework for future works that want to benefit from the same reduction.
This approach may reduce both the number of coefficients involved in the
optimization and the number of products of its implementation by up to 50%.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of modeling background channels in ISAC monostatic mode by proposing a novel stochastic model that characterizes the channel as superposition of sub-channels between monostatic Tx&Rx and multiple communication Rx-like Reference Points, validated through measurements and simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing communication standards only characterize propagation between separated Tx and Rx, but modeling background channels in ISAC monostatic mode (where Tx and Rx are co-located) remains a critical challenge for 6G ISAC system design and standardization.

Method: Conducted ISAC monostatic background channel measurements at 28 GHz in indoor scenario, extracted realistic channel parameters, proposed a novel stochastic model using superposition of sub-channels between monostatic Tx&Rx and multiple communication Rx-like RPs, and developed a genetic algorithm-based method to optimize RP placement.

Result: Measurements revealed pronounced single-hop propagation and discrete multipath distribution. The proposed model effectively captures monostatic background channel characteristics and validation shows good agreement between measured and simulated channel parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed model addresses a critical gap in ISAC channel modeling, is compatible with standardizations, supports 6G standardization, and provides an effective framework for ISAC monostatic background channel characterization.

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) has been identified as a key 6G
application by ITU and 3GPP. A realistic, standard-compatible channel model is
essential for ISAC system design. To characterize the impact of Sensing Targets
(STs), 3GPP defines ISAC channel as a combination of target and background
channels, comprising multipath components related to STs and those originating
solely from the environment, respectively. Although the background channel does
not carry direct ST information, its accurate modeling is critical for
evaluating sensing performance, especially in complex environments. Existing
communication standards characterize propagation between separated transmitter
(Tx) and receiver (Rx). However, modeling background channels in the ISAC
monostatic mode, where the Tx and Rx are co-located, remains a pressing
challenge. In this paper, we firstly conduct ISAC monostatic background channel
measurements for an indoor scenario at 28 GHz. Realistic channel parameters are
extracted, revealing pronounced single-hop propagation and discrete multipath
distribution. Inspired by these properties, a novel stochastic model is
proposed to characterizing the ISAC monostatic background channel as the
superposition of sub-channels between the monostatic Tx&Rx and multiple
communication Rx-like Reference Points (RPs). This model is compatible with
standardizations, and a 3GPP-extended implementation framework is introduced.
Finally, a genetic algorithm-based method is proposed to extract the optimal
number and placement of multi-RPs. The optimization approach and modeling
framework are validated by comparing measured and simulated channel parameters.
Results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively captures monostatic
background channel characteristics, addresses a critical gap in ISAC channel
modeling, and supports 6G standardization.

Conclusion: The findings provide valuable insights for practical deployments and further development of cooperative user tracking techniques in DISAC systems, highlighting the need for robust and efficient AP management.

Abstract: As integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) becomes an integral part of 6G

TL;DR: Medical image segmentation study using BraTS Sub-Saharan Africa dataset shows that nnU-Net trained on original 60 cases outperformed models trained on augmented 360 cases, achieving 0.84 Dice score for whole tumor segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop accurate medical image segmentation for glioma detection using multimodal MRI, allowing physicians to focus on diagnosis while automated systems handle routine image processing tasks.

Method: Used BraTS Sub-Saharan Africa dataset with 60 multimodal MRI cases, compared nnU-Net performance on original dataset vs. offline-augmented dataset (360 cases), leveraging nnU-Net's online augmentation procedures.

Result: nnU-Net trained on original 60 cases achieved better performance (Dice score 0.84 for whole tumor segmentation) than network trained on offline-augmented 360 cases, suggesting offline augmentations introduced artificial variances that reduced generalization.

Conclusion: Data quality and proper augmentation approaches are crucial for building accurate, generalizable medical image segmentation models, especially for underrepresented regions like Sub-Saharan Africa.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical achievement in modern medical
science, developed over decades of research. It allows for the exact
delineation of anatomical and pathological features in two- or
three-dimensional pictures by utilizing notions like pixel intensity, texture,
and anatomical context. With the advent of automated segmentation, physicians
and radiologists may now concentrate on diagnosis and treatment planning while
intelligent computers perform routine image processing tasks.
  This study used the BraTS Sub-Saharan Africa dataset, a selected subset of
the BraTS dataset that included 60 multimodal MRI cases from patients with
glioma. Surprisingly, the nnU Net model trained on the initial 60 instances
performed better than the network trained on an offline-augmented dataset of
360 cases. Hypothetically, the offline augmentations introduced artificial
anatomical variances or intensity distributions, reducing generalization. In
contrast, the original dataset, when paired with nnU Net's robust online
augmentation procedures, maintained realistic variability and produced better
results. The study achieved a Dice score of 0.84 for whole tumor segmentation.
These findings highlight the significance of data quality and proper
augmentation approaches in constructing accurate, generalizable medical picture
segmentation models, particularly for under-represented locations.

*Isar Lemeire,Yee Wei Law,Sang-Heon Lee,Will Meakin,Tat-Jun Chin*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SAAIPAA is a novel framework for physical adversarial attacks on SAR ATR systems that remains effective even without knowing the SAR platform's aspect angles, achieving high fooling rates in white-box settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The surge of adversarial attacks against ML-based SAR automatic target recognition systems necessitates systematic research into physical adversarial perturbation mechanisms to improve attack rigor and effectiveness.

Method: Deploys at least one reflector in each azimuthal quadrant and optimizes reflector orientations to create aspect-angle-invariant physical adversarial attacks, using physics-based modeling of reflector-actuated perturbations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art fooling rates over 80% for DenseNet-121 and ResNet50 in white-box settings, and 99.2% when aspect angles are known. Shows good transferability between some models but room for improvement with others like MobileNetV2.

Conclusion: SAAIPAA provides an effective framework for physical adversarial attacks on SAR ATR that works without aspect angle knowledge, with high success rates and introduces a method for generating bounding boxes for densely sampled azimuthal SAR datasets.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) enables versatile, all-time, all-weather
remote sensing. Coupled with automatic target recognition (ATR) leveraging
machine learning (ML), SAR is empowering a wide range of Earth observation and
surveillance applications. However, the surge of attacks based on adversarial
perturbations against the ML algorithms underpinning SAR ATR is prompting the
need for systematic research into adversarial perturbation mechanisms. Research
in this area began in the digital (image) domain and evolved into the physical
(signal) domain, resulting in physical adversarial attacks (PAAs) that
strategically exploit corner reflectors as attack vectors to evade ML-based
ATR. This paper proposes a novel framework called SAR Aspect-Angles-Invariant
Physical Adversarial Attack (SAAIPAA) for physics-based modelling of
reflector-actuated adversarial perturbations, which improves on the rigor of
prior work. A unique feature of SAAIPAA is its ability to remain effective even
when the attacker lacks knowledge of the SAR platform's aspect angles, by
deploying at least one reflector in each azimuthal quadrant and optimizing
reflector orientations. The resultant physical evasion attacks are efficiently
realizable and optimal over the considered range of aspect angles between a SAR
platform and a target, achieving state-of-the-art fooling rates (over 80% for
DenseNet-121 and ResNet50) in the white-box setting. When aspect angles are
known to the attacker, an average fooling rate of 99.2% is attainable. In
black-box settings, although the attack efficacy of SAAIPAA transfers well
between some models (e.g., from ResNet50 to DenseNet121), the transferability
to some models (e.g., MobileNetV2) can be improved. A useful outcome of using
the MSTAR dataset for the experiments in this article, a method for generating
bounding boxes for densely sampled azimuthal SAR datasets is introduced.

Result: Achieved 84.2% subtype classification accuracy (Macro AUC 0.87±0.03) and gene mutation inference with AUCs: TP53=0.82±0.02, BRCA1=0.76±0.04, ARID1A=0.73±0.05. Nuclear solidity and eccentricity were key predictors for TP53 mutation.

Conclusion: Quantifiable histological phenotypes encode measurable genomic signals, enabling cost-effective precision histopathology for ovarian cancer diagnosis and triage.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer remains one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies,
largely due to late diagnosis and extensive heterogeneity across subtypes.
Current diagnostic methods are limited in their ability to reveal underlying
genomic variations essential for precision oncology. This study introduces a
novel hybrid deep learning pipeline that integrates quantitative nuclear
morphometry with deep convolutional image features to perform ovarian cancer
subtype classification and gene mutation inference directly from Hematoxylin
and Eosin (H&E) histopathological images. Using $\sim45,000$ image patches
sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and public datasets, a fusion model
combining a ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoder and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) was developed. This model successfully captured both local
morphological texture and global tissue context. The pipeline achieved a robust
overall subtype classification accuracy of $84.2\%$ (Macro AUC of $0.87 \pm
0.03$). Crucially, the model demonstrated the capacity for gene mutation
inference with moderate-to-high accuracy: $AUC_{TP53} = 0.82 \pm 0.02$,
$AUC_{BRCA1} = 0.76 \pm 0.04$, and $AUC_{ARID1A} = 0.73 \pm 0.05$. Feature
importance analysis established direct quantitative links, revealing that
nuclear solidity and eccentricity were the dominant predictors for TP53
mutation. These findings validate that quantifiable histological phenotypes
encode measurable genomic signals, paving the way for cost-effective, precision
histopathology in ovarian cancer triage and diagnosis.

TL;DR: A framework combining LLMs with computational image analytics for non-invasive, zero-shot prediction of IDH mutation status in brain gliomas using multi-parametric MRI and tumor segmentation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable precise, non-invasive tumor genotyping in neuro-oncology without requiring manual annotations or fine-tuning.

Method: Extract interpretable semantic attributes and quantitative features from MRI scans and tumor segmentation maps, serialize them in JSON format, and query GPT-4o and GPT-5 models without fine-tuning.

Result: High accuracy and balanced classification performance across six datasets (N=1427), with GPT-5 outperforming GPT-4o. Volumetric features were most important predictors, supplemented by imaging markers and clinical data.

Conclusion: Integration of LLM-based reasoning with computational image analytics shows strong potential for advancing diagnostic strategies in neuro-oncology through non-invasive tumor genotyping.

Abstract: We present a framework that combines Large Language Models with computational
image analytics for non-invasive, zero-shot prediction of IDH mutation status
in brain gliomas. For each subject, coregistered multi-parametric MRI scans and
multi-class tumor segmentation maps were processed to extract interpretable
semantic (visual) attributes and quantitative features, serialized in a
standardized JSON file, and used to query GPT 4o and GPT 5 without fine-tuning.
We evaluated this framework on six publicly available datasets (N = 1427) and
results showcased high accuracy and balanced classification performance across
heterogeneous cohorts, even in the absence of manual annotations. GPT 5
outperformed GPT 4o in context-driven phenotype interpretation. Volumetric
features emerged as the most important predictors, supplemented by
subtype-specific imaging markers and clinical information. Our results
demonstrate the potential of integrating LLM-based reasoning with computational
image analytics for precise, non-invasive tumor genotyping, advancing

### [71] [FATE: A Formal Benchmark Series for Frontier Algebra of Multiple Difficulty Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02872)
*Jiedong Jiang,Wanyi He,Yuefeng Wang,Guoxiong Gao,Yongle Hu,Jingting Wang,Nailing Guan,Peihao Wu,Chunbo Dai,Liang Xiao,Bin Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FATE is a new formal algebra benchmark series that goes beyond contest math to evaluate research-level mathematical reasoning, revealing major performance gaps in current LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks focus on contest math (like IMO) which doesn't reflect the depth and abstraction of modern mathematical research, creating a need for more challenging evaluation.

Method: Created FATE benchmark series with two components (FATE-H and FATE-X) containing 100 problems each in abstract and commutative algebra, spanning from undergraduate to PhD+ difficulty levels.

Result: Best LLM achieved only 3% accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X, with models showing better natural-language reasoning than formalization ability. Specialized provers showed less effective reflection than general models.

Conclusion: FATE establishes essential checkpoints for research-level formal mathematical reasoning and reveals significant challenges in current AI systems for advanced mathematical formalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in formal theorem proving, particularly on contest-based
mathematical benchmarks like the IMO. However, these contests do not reflect
the depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge
this gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new
benchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced
mathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each
with 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a
difficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD
qualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both
PhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our
evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a
stark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3%
(pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals
that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their
ability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common
errors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative
study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection
than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language
stage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that
establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal
mathematical reasoning.

*Junhyung Park,Hyungjin Kim,Seokho Ahn,Young-Duk Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepForm is a framework for dynamic group formation in recommender systems that uses stochastic deep graph clustering to handle real-time group formation with adaptive group numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing group recommender systems assume static or predefined groups, making them unsuitable for dynamic real-world scenarios where groups need to form and adapt in real-time.

Method: Uses lightweight GCN architecture to capture high-order user information, stochastic cluster learning for adaptive group reconfiguration without retraining, and contrastive learning to refine groups under dynamic conditions.

Result: Experiments show DeepForm achieves superior group formation quality, efficiency, and recommendation accuracy compared to various baselines across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: DeepForm effectively addresses the core challenge of dynamic group formation in recommender systems by meeting key operational requirements for real-world deployment.

Abstract: While prior work on group recommender systems (GRSs) has primarily focused on
improving recommendation accuracy, most approaches assume static or predefined
groups, making them unsuitable for dynamic, real-world scenarios. We reframe
group formation as a core challenge in GRSs and propose DeepForm (Stochastic
Deep Graph Clustering for Practical Group Formation), a framework designed to
meet three key operational requirements: (1) the incorporation of high-order
user information, (2) real-time group formation, and (3) dynamic adjustment of
the number of groups. DeepForm employs a lightweight GCN architecture that
effectively captures high-order structural signals. Stochastic cluster learning
enables adaptive group reconfiguration without retraining, while contrastive
learning refines groups under dynamic conditions. Experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that DeepForm achieves superior group formation quality,
efficiency, and recommendation accuracy compared with various baselines.

*Ronan Killian McGovern*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 7M parameter recursive neural network pre-trained on public ARC tasks achieves 6.67% score on semi-private evaluation tasks after efficient fine-tuning within competition compute limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous open source approaches like TRM achieved good scores but required excessive compute beyond competition limits, creating a need for efficient fine-tuning methods.

Method: Pre-trained a tiny recursive model on 1,280 public ARC tasks for 700k+ steps over 48 hours, then performed full fine-tuning (not LoRA) for just 12,500 gradient steps during competition.

Result: Achieved 6.67% score on semi-private evaluation tasks after post-training, starting from ~10% score on public evaluation set after pre-training.

Conclusion: Starting from pre-trained tiny recursive models enables efficient fine-tuning within competition compute constraints while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Prior to the close of the 2025 ARC Prize competition, the leading open source
approach - known as TRM, or Tiny Recursive Models - involved training a 7M
parameter recursive neural network on augmented variants of ARC tasks. That
approach scored approximately 7.8% on the public ARC AGI II evaluation set, but
required a level of compute far in excess of what is allowed during the
competition. This paper shows that, by starting from a tiny recursive model
that has been pre-trained on public ARC tasks, one can efficiently fine-tune on
competition tasks within the allowed compute limits. Specifically, a model was
pre-trained on 1,280 public tasks for 700k+ optimizer steps over 48 hours on
4xH100 SXM GPUs to obtain a ~10% score on the public evaluation set. That model
was then post-trained in just 12,500 gradient steps during the competition to
reach a score of 6.67% on semi-private evaluation tasks. Notably, such
post-training performance is achieved by full-fine tuning of the tiny model,
not LoRA fine-tuning or fine-tuning of task embeddings alone.

Result: Preliminary results show reduced search time, lower fuel consumption, and improved resource utilization for fishermen.

Conclusion: The framework enhances PFZ identification accuracy and provides region-specific insights for sustainable fishing practices.

Abstract: The North Indian Ocean, including the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal,
represents a vital source of livelihood for coastal communities, yet fishermen
often face uncertainty in locating productive fishing grounds. To address this
challenge, we present an AI-assisted framework for predicting Potential Fishing

chlorophyll concentration. The approach is designed to enhance the accuracy of
PFZ identification and provide region-specific insights for sustainable fishing
practices. Preliminary results indicate that the framework can support
fishermen by reducing search time, lowering fuel consumption, and promoting
efficient resource utilization.

TL;DR: Proposes CTF-IDF (Clement Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and uses IRLBA for dimensionality reduction to create a more efficient text analytics pipeline that reduces carbon footprint compared to deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the increasing carbon footprint from deep learning's high computational demands in text analytics by reviving classical machine learning methods with improved efficiency.

Method: Modified TF-IDF algorithm to create CTF-IDF for data preprocessing, combined with faster IRLBA algorithm for dimensionality reduction in text analytics pipeline.

Result: Significant reduction in time complexity and computational requirements with minor accuracy compromise compared to deep learning, while improving model accuracy for classical ML methods.

Conclusion: Classical ML techniques with CTF-IDF and IRLBA offer a more efficient, faster, and environmentally friendly alternative to deep learning for text analytics with acceptable accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: The uprising of deep learning methodology and practice in recent years has
brought about a severe consequence of increasing carbon footprint due to the
insatiable demand for computational resources and power. The field of text
analytics also experienced a massive transformation in this trend of
monopolizing methodology. In this paper, the original TF-IDF algorithm has been
modified, and Clement Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (CTF-IDF) has
been proposed for data preprocessing. This paper primarily discusses the
effectiveness of classical machine learning techniques in text analytics with
CTF-IDF and a faster IRLBA algorithm for dimensionality reduction. The
introduction of both of these techniques in the conventional text analytics
pipeline ensures a more efficient, faster, and less computationally intensive
application when compared with deep learning methodology regarding carbon
footprint, with minor compromise in accuracy. The experimental results also
exhibit a manifold of reduction in time complexity and improvement of model
accuracy for the classical machine learning methods discussed further in this
paper.

*W. K. M Mithsara,Ning Yang,Ahmed Imteaj,Hussein Zangoti,Abdur R. Shahid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes using LLMs for zero/few-shot poisoning detection and sanitization in human activity recognition systems, reducing need for large labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable IoT systems are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, and conventional defenses require extensive labeled data which limits adaptability in dynamic environments.

Method: Uses LLMs with role-play prompting and step-by-step reasoning to detect anomalies and generate clean sensor data alternatives in zero/one/few-shot learning paradigms.

Result: Framework demonstrates practical effectiveness in detection accuracy, sanitization quality, latency, and communication cost for wearable IoT security.

Conclusion: LLMs provide robust, adaptable defense mechanisms that improve security and reliability of wearable IoT systems without extensive dataset curation.

Abstract: The widespread integration of wearable sensing devices in Internet of Things
(IoT) ecosystems, particularly in healthcare, smart homes, and industrial
applications, has required robust human activity recognition (HAR) techniques
to improve functionality and user experience. Although machine learning models
have advanced HAR, they are increasingly susceptible to data poisoning attacks
that compromise the data integrity and reliability of these systems.
Conventional approaches to defending against such attacks often require
extensive task-specific training with large, labeled datasets, which limits
adaptability in dynamic IoT environments. This work proposes a novel framework
that uses large language models (LLMs) to perform poisoning detection and
sanitization in HAR systems, utilizing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot
learning paradigms. Our approach incorporates \textit{role play} prompting,
whereby the LLM assumes the role of expert to contextualize and evaluate sensor
anomalies, and \textit{think step-by-step} reasoning, guiding the LLM to infer
poisoning indicators in the raw sensor data and plausible clean alternatives.
These strategies minimize reliance on curation of extensive datasets and enable
robust, adaptable defense mechanisms in real-time. We perform an extensive
evaluation of the framework, quantifying detection accuracy, sanitization
quality, latency, and communication cost, thus demonstrating the practicality
and effectiveness of LLMs in improving the security and reliability of wearable
IoT systems.

*Jing Ma,Hanlin Li,Xiang Xiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes limitations of classical Entropy Minimization (EM) and proposes Adaptive Decoupled Entropy Minimization (AdaDEM) to address reward collapse and easy-class bias issues, achieving superior performance in imperfectly supervised learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the internal mechanism of Entropy Minimization and address its limitations caused by coupled formulation, including reward collapse and easy-class bias.

Method: Reformulate classical EM into cluster aggregation driving factor (CADF) and gradient mitigation calibrator (GMC), then propose AdaDEM with normalized CADF rewards and marginal entropy calibrator (MEC) replacement.

Result: AdaDEM outperforms DEM* (upper-bound variant of classical EM) and achieves superior performance across various imperfectly supervised learning tasks in noisy and dynamic environments.

Conclusion: Decoupling EM into adaptive components effectively addresses the limitations of classical EM and improves performance in imperfect supervision scenarios.

Abstract: Entropy Minimization (EM) is beneficial to reducing class overlap, bridging
domain gap, and restricting uncertainty for various tasks in machine learning,
yet its potential is limited. To study the internal mechanism of EM, we
reformulate and decouple the classical EM into two parts with opposite effects:
cluster aggregation driving factor (CADF) rewards dominant classes and prompts
a peaked output distribution, while gradient mitigation calibrator (GMC)
penalizes high-confidence classes based on predicted probabilities.
Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of classical EM caused by its coupled
formulation: 1) reward collapse impedes the contribution of high-certainty
samples in the learning process, and 2) easy-class bias induces misalignment
between output distribution and label distribution. To address these issues, we
propose Adaptive Decoupled Entropy Minimization (AdaDEM), which normalizes the
reward brought from CADF and employs a marginal entropy calibrator (MEC) to
replace GMC. AdaDEM outperforms DEM*, an upper-bound variant of classical EM,
and achieves superior performance across various imperfectly supervised
learning tasks in noisy and dynamic environments.

TL;DR: Using Llama 3.1-405B LLM to automatically generate structured data use case labels for genomic dataset citations in scientific literature, achieving promising zero-shot classification results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to scale analysis of how datasets are used in scientific literature without expensive manual labeling or training data development for traditional ML systems.

Method: Applied open-source Llama 3.1-405B LLM for zero-shot classification of data use cases in publications citing genomic datasets, with novel evaluation framework.

Result: Achieved F1 score of 0.674 on zero-shot data citation classification task without predefined categories.

Conclusion: Method shows promise but faces challenges with data availability, prompt overfitting, computational infrastructure, and evaluation costs.

Abstract: Efforts have increased in recent years to identify associations between
specific datasets and the scientific literature that incorporates them. Knowing
that a given publication cites a given dataset, the next logical step is to
explore how or why that data was used. Advances in recent years with
pretrained, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) offer potential
means for scaling the description of data use cases in the published
literature. This avoids expensive manual labeling and the development of
training datasets for classical machine-learning (ML) systems. In this work we
apply an open-source LLM, Llama 3.1-405B, to generate structured data use case
labels for publications known to incorporate specific genomic datasets. We also
introduce a novel evaluation framework for determining the efficacy of our
methods. Our results demonstrate that the stock model can achieve an F1 score
of .674 on a zero-shot data citation classification task with no previously
defined categories. While promising, our results are qualified by barriers
related to data availability, prompt overfitting, computational infrastructure,
and the expense required to conduct responsible performance evaluation.

*Fengxu Li,Stephanie M. Carpenter,Matthew P. Buman,Yonatan Mintz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Developed ROGUE-TS algorithm with Thompson Sampling for nonstationary bandit problems, plus probability clipping to balance personalization and population-level learning in micro-randomized trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing algorithms for nonstationary bandits overemphasize exploitation, limiting exploration needed to estimate population-level effects in micro-randomized trials for behavioral health interventions.

Method: ROGUE-TS (Thompson Sampling algorithm for ROGUE framework) with probability clipping procedure to balance regret and minimum exploration probability.

Result: Achieved lower regret than existing approaches while maintaining high statistical power through clipping, enabling reliable detection of treatment effects.

Conclusion: Provides practical framework for balancing personalization with statistical validity in micro-randomized trials, accounting for individual behavioral dynamics.

Abstract: A common challenge for decision makers is selecting actions whose rewards are
unknown and evolve over time based on prior policies. For instance, repeated
use may reduce an action's effectiveness (habituation), while inactivity may
restore it (recovery). These nonstationarities are captured by the Reducing or
Gaining Unknown Efficacy (ROGUE) bandit framework, which models real-world
settings such as behavioral health interventions. While existing algorithms can
compute sublinear regret policies to optimize these settings, they may not
provide sufficient exploration due to overemphasis on exploitation, limiting
the ability to estimate population-level effects. This is a challenge of
particular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in
developing just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level
effects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In
this paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored
to the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret.
We then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization
and population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret
and minimum exploration probability. Validation on two MRT datasets concerning
physical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment shows that our
methods both achieve lower regret than existing approaches and maintain high
statistical power through the clipping procedure without significantly
increasing regret. This enables reliable detection of treatment effects while
accounting for individual behavioral dynamics. For researchers designing MRTs,
our framework offers practical guidance on balancing personalization with
statistical validity.

TL;DR: A Digital Twin-Graph Neural Network framework for proactive pavement health monitoring and predictive maintenance using graph-based modeling of road networks with real-time data streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Pavement Management Systems are reactive and lack real-time intelligence for failure prevention and optimal maintenance planning, failing to handle complex spatial dependencies and non-linear deterioration.

Method: Model pavement segments as graph nodes and spatial relations as edges, using inductive Graph Neural Networks to learn deterioration patterns from graph-structured inputs with real-time UAV, sensor, and LiDAR data streaming into a Digital Twin.

Conclusion: The DT-GNN integration enhances forecasting precision and establishes a closed feedback loop for continuous improvement, providing a foundation for proactive, intelligent, and sustainable pavement management with potential for real-world deployment and smart-city integration.

Abstract: Pavement infrastructure monitoring is challenged by complex spatial
dependencies, changing environmental conditions, and non-linear deterioration
across road networks. Traditional Pavement Management Systems (PMS) remain
largely reactive, lacking real-time intelligence for failure prevention and
optimal maintenance planning. To address this, we propose a unified Digital
Twin (DT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for scalable, data-driven
pavement health monitoring and predictive maintenance. Pavement segments and
spatial relations are modeled as graph nodes and edges, while real-time UAV,
sensor, and LiDAR data stream into the DT. The inductive GNN learns
deterioration patterns from graph-structured inputs to forecast distress and
enable proactive interventions. Trained on a real-world-inspired dataset with
segment attributes and dynamic connectivity, our model achieves an R2 of
0.3798, outperforming baseline regressors and effectively capturing non-linear
degradation. We also develop an interactive dashboard and reinforcement
learning module for simulation, visualization, and adaptive maintenance
planning. This DT-GNN integration enhances forecasting precision and
establishes a closed feedback loop for continuous improvement, positioning the
approach as a foundation for proactive, intelligent, and sustainable pavement
management, with future extensions toward real-world deployment, multi-agent
coordination, and smart-city integration.

TL;DR: UserAlign is a novel inference-time personalized alignment method that uses pairwise response comparisons to quickly identify user preferences with few queries, building on best-arm identification in logistic bandits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized alignment methods either require extensive user preference queries or explicit text input specifications, creating practical limitations for real-world applications.

Method: UserAlign elicits user preferences through pairwise response comparisons, treats feedback as consistent and noise-free, and applies best-arm identification from logistic bandits theory to select optimal responses from a fixed pool.

Result: Experimental results across personalized text and image generation tasks demonstrate UserAlign's effectiveness in achieving personalized alignment with minimal user queries.

Conclusion: UserAlign provides an efficient inference-time solution for personalized alignment that requires only a few pairwise comparisons, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: We study the problem of aligning a generative model's response with a user's
preferences. Recent works have proposed several different formulations for
personalized alignment; however, they either require a large amount of user
preference queries or require that the preference be explicitly specified as a
text input. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time personalized
alignment method, UserAlign, that elicits the user's preferences with a few
queries as pairwise response comparisons. In particular, UserAlign builds on
the theoretical framework of best-arm identification in logistic bandits and
selects a personalized response from a fixed pool of the model's generated
responses. The key idea is to consider the user's feedback consistent and
noise-free, and incorporate it into the theoretical framework to identify the
best response quickly. Experimental results across several tasks, involving
personalized text and image generation, showcase the effectiveness of UserAlign
in achieving personalized alignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Integrating expected value of information (EVOI) into Bootstrapped DQN to enhance deep exploration in sparse-reward environments without extra hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional exploration methods struggle in high-dimensional states with sparse rewards, failing to balance exploration and exploitation effectively.

Method: Developed two novel algorithms that incorporate EVOI into Bootstrapped DQN, using value of information estimates to measure network head discrepancies and guide exploration.

Result: Improved performance in complex Atari games with sparse rewards, better uncertainty utilization, and no additional hyperparameters needed.

Conclusion: EVOI integration significantly enhances deep exploration capabilities in reinforcement learning for challenging sparse-reward environments.

Abstract: Efficient exploration in deep reinforcement learning remains a fundamental
challenge, especially in environments characterized by high-dimensional states
and sparse rewards. Traditional exploration strategies that rely on random
local policy noise, such as $\epsilon$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration
methods, often struggle to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation. In
this paper, we integrate the notion of (expected) value of information (EVOI)
within the well-known Bootstrapped DQN algorithmic framework, to enhance the
algorithm's deep exploration ability. Specifically, we develop two novel
algorithms that incorporate the expected gain from learning the value of
information into Bootstrapped DQN. Our methods use value of information
estimates to measure the discrepancies of opinions among distinct network
heads, and drive exploration towards areas with the most potential. We evaluate
our algorithms with respect to performance and their ability to exploit
inherent uncertainty arising from random network initialization. Our
experiments in complex, sparse-reward Atari games demonstrate increased
performance, all the while making better use of uncertainty, and, importantly,
without introducing extra hyperparameters.

*Hongrui Chen,Liwei Wang,Levent Burak Kara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural network-based framework for designing heterogeneous metamaterials that learns continuous two-scale representations, enabling seamless connectivity between unit cells without predefined datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metamaterial design methods face challenges with enormous design spaces, compatibility requirements between cells, and discontinuities at boundaries. Data-driven approaches are limited by fixed libraries and require post-processing.

Method: Uses a multiscale neural representation where the network takes global and local coordinates as inputs, outputting an implicit field representing multiscale structures. Includes compatibility loss to enforce connectivity between adjacent unit cells.

Result: The framework produces metamaterial designs at arbitrarily high resolution, enabling infinite upsampling for fabrication or simulation. Successfully demonstrated on mechanical metamaterial design, negative Poisson's ratio, and mechanical cloaking problems.

Conclusion: The proposed neural network-based approach effectively addresses challenges in heterogeneous metamaterial design by providing continuous representations with seamless connectivity, with applications in robotics, bioengineering, and aerospace.

Abstract: Metamaterials are engineered materials composed of specially designed unit
cells that exhibit extraordinary properties beyond those of natural materials.
Complex engineering tasks often require heterogeneous unit cells to accommodate
spatially varying property requirements. However, designing heterogeneous
metamaterials poses significant challenges due to the enormous design space and
strict compatibility requirements between neighboring cells. Traditional
concurrent multiscale design methods require solving an expensive optimization
problem for each unit cell and often suffer from discontinuities at cell
boundaries. On the other hand, data-driven approaches that assemble structures
from a fixed library of microstructures are limited by the dataset and require
additional post-processing to ensure seamless connections. In this work, we
propose a neural network-based metamaterial design framework that learns a
continuous two-scale representation of the structure, thereby jointly
addressing these challenges. Central to our framework is a multiscale neural
representation in which the neural network takes both global (macroscale) and
local (microscale) coordinates as inputs, outputting an implicit field that
represents multiscale structures with compatible unit cell geometries across
the domain, without the need for a predefined dataset. We use a compatibility
loss term during training to enforce connectivity between adjacent unit cells.
Once trained, the network can produce metamaterial designs at arbitrarily high
resolution, hence enabling infinite upsampling for fabrication or simulation.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on mechanical
metamaterial design, negative Poisson's ratio, and mechanical cloaking problems
with potential applications in robotics, bioengineering, and aerospace.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-structured data is difficult for traditional generative models due to its discrete, unordered nature, leading to the need for specialized approaches like discrete diffusion and flow matching models.

Method: GraphBSI uses Bayesian Sample Inference to iteratively refine beliefs over graphs in continuous distribution parameter space, formulates BSI as an SDE, and derives noise-controlled SDEs that preserve marginal distributions via score function approximation.

Result: GraphBSI achieves state-of-the-art performance on molecular and synthetic graph generation, outperforming existing one-shot graph generative models on Moses and GuacaMol benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed GraphBSI framework effectively handles discrete graph structures through continuous belief refinement and demonstrates superior performance in graph generation tasks.

Abstract: Generating graph-structured data is crucial in applications such as molecular
generation, knowledge graphs, and network analysis. However, their discrete,
unordered nature makes them difficult for traditional generative models,
leading to the rise of discrete diffusion and flow matching models. In this
work, we introduce GraphBSI, a novel one-shot graph generative model based on
Bayesian Sample Inference (BSI). Instead of evolving samples directly, GraphBSI
iteratively refines a belief over graphs in the continuous space of
distribution parameters, naturally handling discrete structures. Further, we
state BSI as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and derive a
noise-controlled family of SDEs that preserves the marginal distributions via
an approximation of the score function. Our theoretical analysis further
reveals the connection to Bayesian Flow Networks and Diffusion models. Finally,
in our empirical evaluation, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on
molecular and synthetic graph generation, outperforming existing one-shot graph
generative models on the standard benchmarks Moses and GuacaMol.

*Lingqing Shen,Chi Heem Wong,Misaki Mito,Arnab Chakrabarti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive-sensorless monitoring with residual correction to improve container temperature/humidity predictions by correcting systematic biases using telemetry data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensorless monitoring lacks telemetry integration and systematic error correction, causing significant prediction deviations from actual data and confusing users.

Method: Introduces residual correction method - a framework to correct systematic biases in sensorless models after observing live telemetry data, creating adaptive-sensorless models.

Result: On 3.48M data points, adaptive-sensorless models achieved MAEs of 2.24-2.31°C (vs 2.43°C) for temperature and 5.72-7.09% (vs 7.99%) for humidity, with RMSEs of 3.19-3.26°C (vs 3.38°C) for temperature and 7.70-9.12% (vs 10.0%) for humidity.

Conclusion: Adaptive-sensorless models enable more accurate cargo monitoring, early risk detection, and reduced dependence on full connectivity in global shipping.

Abstract: Monitoring the internal temperature and humidity of shipping containers is
essential to preventing quality degradation during cargo transportation.
Sensorless monitoring -- machine learning models that predict the internal
conditions of the containers using exogenous factors -- shows promise as an
alternative to monitoring using sensors. However, it does not incorporate
telemetry information and correct for systematic errors, causing the
predictions to differ significantly from the live data and confusing the users.
In this paper, we introduce the residual correction method, a general framework
for correcting for systematic biases in sensorless models after observing live
telemetry data. We call this class of models ``adaptive-sensorless''
monitoring. We train and evaluate adaptive-sensorless models on the 3.48
million data points -- the largest dataset of container sensor readings ever
used in academic research -- and show that they produce consistent improvements
over the baseline sensorless models. When evaluated on the holdout set of the
simulated data, they achieve average mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 2.24 $\sim$
2.31$^\circ$C (vs 2.43$^\circ$C by sensorless) for temperature and 5.72 $\sim$
7.09% for relative humidity (vs 7.99% by sensorless) and average root
mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 3.19 $\sim$ 3.26$^\circ$C for temperature (vs
3.38$^\circ$C by sensorless) and 7.70 $\sim$ 9.12% for relative humidity (vs
10.0% by sensorless). Adaptive-sensorless models enable more accurate cargo
monitoring, early risk detection, and less dependence on full connectivity in
global shipping.

### [86] [Leveraging Discrete Function Decomposability for Scientific Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03032)
*James C. Bowden,Sergey Levine,Jennifer Listgarten*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DADO is a new distributional optimization algorithm that leverages decomposability structure in design spaces using junction trees and graph message-passing for more efficient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distributional optimization algorithms cannot utilize decomposability structure in property predictors, which is common in scientific applications where design variables interact loosely.

Method: Uses a soft-factorized search distribution with graph message-passing to coordinate optimization across linked factors defined by a junction tree on design variables.

Result: The paper proposes and demonstrates DADO as an efficient algorithm for distributional optimization in decomposable design spaces.

Conclusion: DADO enables more effective optimization by leveraging decomposability structure that current methods cannot utilize.

Abstract: In the era of AI-driven science and engineering, we often want to design
discrete objects in silico according to user-specified properties. For example,
we may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a
circuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a
property predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a
generative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to
concentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization
-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as
reinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that
maximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over
discrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial
nature of the design space. However, many property predictors in scientific
applications are decomposable in the sense that they can be factorized over
design variables in a way that could in principle enable more effective
optimization. For example, amino acids at a catalytic site of a protein may
only loosely interact with amino acids of the rest of the protein to achieve
maximal catalytic activity. Current distributional optimization algorithms are
unable to make use of such decomposability structure. Herein, we propose and
demonstrate use of a new distributional optimization algorithm,
Decomposition-Aware Distributional Optimization (DADO), that can leverage any
decomposability defined by a junction tree on the design variables, to make
optimization more efficient. At its core, DADO employs a soft-factorized
"search distribution" -- a learned generative model -- for efficient navigation
of the search space, invoking graph message-passing to coordinate optimization
across linked factors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers have shown promise in financial forecasting but their application to options data remains unexplored. This work investigates using Vision Transformer architecture for options volatility prediction.

Method: Train Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture on implied volatility surfaces augmented with date information to predict next 30-day realized volatility.

Result: ViT successfully learns seasonal patterns and nonlinear features from the implied volatility surface, demonstrating promising forecasting capabilities.

Conclusion: Using Vision Transformer for options data is a promising direction for financial model development, showing potential for learning complex patterns in volatility surfaces.

Abstract: Recent work in financial machine learning has shown the virtue of complexity:
the phenomenon by which deep learning methods capable of learning highly
nonlinear relationships outperform simpler approaches in financial forecasting.
While transformer architectures like Informer have shown promise for financial
time series forecasting, the application of transformer models for options data
remains largely unexplored. We conduct preliminary studies towards the
development of a transformer model for options data by training the Vision
Transformer (ViT) architecture, typically used in modern image recognition and
classification systems, to predict the realized volatility of an asset over the
next 30 days from its implied volatility surface (augmented with date
information) for a single day. We show that the ViT can learn seasonal patterns
and nonlinear features from the IV surface, suggesting a promising direction
for model development.

TL;DR: Introduces unsupervised metrics for evaluating LLM-based enterprise applications using statistical properties of unlabeled interaction data and fine-tuned LLMs to adapt to distributional shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for LLM-based enterprise applications face challenges: complex unlabeled data, impractical human annotation at scale, limited custom metrics, and unreliable LLM judges.

Method: Develop unsupervised metrics using statistical properties of unlabeled interaction data and fine-tuned LLMs to adapt to distributional shifts. Metrics cover user goal labeling, goal completion measurement, and LLM uncertainty quantification without human-generated ideal responses.

Result: The approach is validated on both open-domain and task-specific interaction data, demonstrating effectiveness in evaluating objective-driven interactions without requiring labeled data.

Conclusion: Proposes the first set of unsupervised metrics for objective-driven interactions that overcome limitations of existing evaluation methods by leveraging unlabeled data and fine-tuned LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen increasing popularity in enterprise
applications where AI agents and humans engage in objective-driven
interactions. However, these systems are difficult to evaluate: data may be
complex and unlabeled; human annotation is often impractical at scale; custom
metrics can monitor for specific errors, but not previously-undetected ones;
and LLM judges can produce unreliable results. We introduce the first set of
unsupervised metrics for objective-driven interactions, leveraging statistical
properties of unlabeled interaction data and using fine-tuned LLMs to adapt to
distributional shifts. We develop metrics for labeling user goals, measuring
goal completion, and quantifying LLM uncertainty without grounding evaluations
in human-generated ideal responses. Our approach is validated on open-domain
and task-specific interaction data.

### [89] [The Curved Spacetime of Transformer Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03060)
*Riccardo Di Sipio,Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez,Luis Serrano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a geometric framework comparing Transformer language models to General Relativity, where attention mechanisms create curvature in representation space and token embeddings follow curved trajectories rather than straight paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a geometric understanding of how Transformer-based language models work by drawing analogies to concepts from General Relativity, particularly focusing on how attention mechanisms create curvature in the representation space.

Method: The authors use a geometric framework where queries and keys induce an effective metric, attention acts as parallel transport, and layers provide discrete time-slices. They design experiments to visualize curvature landscapes, analyze turning angles and length-to-chord ratios, and probe deflection under context edits inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment.

Result: Experimental results reveal: (i) visualization of curvature landscapes showing varying local turning angles across tokens and layers; (ii) excess counts of sharp/flat angles and longer length-to-chord ratios not explainable by dimensionality or chance; (iii) measurable, meaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories under controlled context edits, confirming attention-induced curvature.

Conclusion: The geometric analogy to General Relativity is valid - token embeddings in Transformers do not traverse straight paths but follow curved trajectories shaped by attention-induced curvature in the representation space, with experimental evidence supporting this framework.

Abstract: We present a geometric framework for understanding Transformer-based language
models, drawing an explicit analogy to General Relativity. Queries and keys
induce an effective metric on representation space, and attention acts as a
discrete connection that implements parallel transport of value vectors across
tokens. Stacked layers provide discrete time-slices through which token
representations evolve on this curved manifold, while backpropagation plays the
role of a least-action principle that shapes loss-minimizing trajectories in
parameter space. If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not
traverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps
should bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature.
To test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence
and the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a
full paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and
layers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat
angles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality
or chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe
deflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable,
meaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm
attention-induced curvature.

### [90] [Homomorphism distortion: A metric to distinguish them all and in the latent space bind them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03068)
*Martin Carrasco,Olga Zaghen,Erik Bekkers,Bastian Rieck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces graph homomorphism distortion as a principled measure for comparing vertex-attributed graphs, showing it can completely characterize graphs and serve as a complete graph embedding. It addresses the graph canonization problem through efficient sampling and establishes this measure as a metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for measuring graph neural network expressivity rely only on combinatorial properties. The authors aim to provide a more principled way to measure similarity between vertex-attributed graphs that can fully characterize graphs.

Method: The authors propose graph homomorphism distortion as a measure, address the graph canonization problem through efficient sampling, and demonstrate that this measure can be transformed into a metric.

Result: The graph homomorphism distortion fully distinguishes the BREC dataset (including graphs non-distinguishable by 4-WL) and outperforms previous homomorphism-based methods on the ZINC-12k dataset.

Conclusion: This work provides a new theoretical foundation for graph characterization that extends beyond traditional combinatorial approaches, paving the way for future graph theoretic advancements.

Abstract: For far too long, expressivity of graph neural networks has been measured
\emph{only} in terms of combinatorial properties. In this work we stray away
from this tradition and provide a principled way to measure similarity between
vertex attributed graphs. We denote this measure as the \emph{graph
homomorphism distortion}. We show it can \emph{completely characterize} graphs
and thus is also a \emph{complete graph embedding}. However, somewhere along
the road, we run into the graph canonization problem. To circumvent this
obstacle, we devise to efficiently compute this measure via sampling, which in
expectation ensures \emph{completeness}. Additionally, we also discovered that
we can obtain a metric from this measure. We validate our claims empirically
and find that the \emph{graph homomorphism distortion}: (1.) fully
distinguishes the \texttt{BREC} dataset with up to $4$-WL non-distinguishable
graphs, and (2.) \emph{outperforms} previous methods inspired in homomorphisms
under the \texttt{ZINC-12k} dataset.
  These theoretical results, (and their empirical validation), pave the way for
future characterization of graphs, extending the graph theoretic tradition to
new frontiers.

*Fatemeh Ghaffari,Siddarth Sitaraman,Xutong Liu,Xuchuang Wang,Mohammad Hajiesmaili*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MSUCB is a robust online learning to rank algorithm that uses a novel mean-of-medians estimator to handle click fraud and corruption, achieving optimal logarithmic regret without corruption and graceful degradation under corruption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online learning to rank systems are vulnerable to click fraud and manipulation, where corrupted feedback misleads the learning process and degrades user experience.

Method: Proposed MSUCB algorithm incorporating a novel mean-of-medians estimator that filters outliers and corrupted samples while behaving like standard mean in absence of corruption.

Result: Achieves optimal logarithmic regret without corruption and degrades gracefully under corruption with only additive regret tied to total corruption. Outperforms prior methods with 97.35% and 91.60% regret improvements.

Conclusion: MSUCB provides strong robustness against corruption while maintaining optimal performance in clean environments, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) studies how to recommend a short ranked list
of items from a large pool and improves future rankings based on user clicks.
This setting is commonly modeled as cascading bandits, where the objective is
to maximize the likelihood that the user clicks on at least one of the
presented items across as many timesteps as possible. However, such systems are
vulnerable to click fraud and other manipulations (i.e., corruption), where
bots or paid click farms inject corrupted feedback that misleads the learning
process and degrades user experience. In this paper, we propose MSUCB, a robust
algorithm that incorporates a novel mean-of-medians estimator, which to our
knowledge is applied to bandits with corruption setting for the first time.
This estimator behaves like a standard mean in the absence of corruption, so no
cost is paid for robustness. Under corruption, the median step filters out
outliers and corrupted samples, keeping the estimate close to its true value.
Updating this estimate at every round further accelerates empirical convergence
in experiments. Hence, MSUCB achieves optimal logarithmic regret in the absence
of corruption and degrades gracefully under corruptions, with regret increasing
only by an additive term tied to the total corruption. Comprehensive and
extensive experiments on real-world datasets further demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms prior methods while maintaining strong
robustness. In particular, it achieves a \(97.35\%\) and a \(91.60\%\) regret
improvement over two state-of-the-art methods.

*Gaia Grosso,Sai Sumedh R. Hindupur,Thomas Fel,Samuel Bright-Thonney,Philip Harris,Demba Ba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels for anomaly detection that addresses the challenge of detecting weak or rare signals in high-dimensional representation spaces through principles of sparsity, locality, and competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI representations lack controlled statistical properties, causing traditional anomaly detection methods to fail when weak or rare signals are hidden within normal data patterns.

Method: SparKer uses a semi-supervised Neyman-Pearson framework with sparse ensembles of Gaussian kernels that adaptively partition representation space around regions of statistical imbalance, guided by sparsity, locality, and competition principles.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness across scientific discovery, novelty detection, intrusion detection, and generative-model validation, requiring only a handful of kernels to identify anomalies in thousand-dimensional spaces.

Conclusion: SparKer provides an interpretable, efficient, and scalable approach to anomaly detection that successfully bridges the gap in detecting subtle anomalies in high-dimensional AI representations.

Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence has revolutionized our ability to extract rich
and versatile data representations across scientific disciplines. Yet, the
statistical properties of these representations remain poorly controlled,
causing misspecified anomaly detection (AD) methods to falter. Weak or rare
signals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data,
creating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine
this gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods
operating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony;
locality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote
efficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of
self-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation
space around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these
principles, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained
within a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the
likelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal,
anomaly-free reference. We provide theoretical insights into the mechanisms
that drive detection and self-organization in the proposed model, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on realistic high-dimensional
problems of scientific discovery, open-world novelty detection, intrusion
detection, and generative-model validation. Our applications span both the
natural- and computer-science domains. We demonstrate that ensembles containing
only a handful of kernels can identify statistically significant anomalous
locations within representation spaces of thousands of dimensions, underscoring
both the interpretability, efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: DiCoDe is a scalable co-design framework that uses diffusion models and guidance techniques to jointly optimize agent policies and environment configurations, achieving superior performance with fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current co-design methods struggle with high-dimensional design spaces and sample inefficiency when dealing with the moving targets of joint optimization, limiting practical applications.

Method: Developed Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe) with two innovations: Projected Universal Guidance (PUG) for constrained environment exploration, and critic distillation to share knowledge from RL critics for adaptive learning.

Result: Achieved 39% higher rewards in warehouse automation with 66% fewer simulation samples, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiCoDe sets a new standard in agent-environment co-design and represents a significant step toward practical real-world applications of co-design principles.

Abstract: The agent-environment co-design paradigm jointly optimises agent policies and
environment configurations in search of improved system performance. With
application domains ranging from warehouse logistics to windfarm management,
co-design promises to fundamentally change how we deploy multi-agent systems.
However, current co-design methods struggle to scale. They collapse under
high-dimensional environment design spaces and suffer from sample inefficiency
when addressing moving targets inherent to joint optimisation. We address these
challenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and
sample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically
relevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we
introduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables
DiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while
satisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles.
Second, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the
reinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts
to evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal.
Together, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when
validated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including
warehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation. Our
method consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art, achieving, for example, 39%
higher rewards in the warehouse setting with 66% fewer simulation samples. This
sets a new standard in agent-environment co-design, and is a stepping stone
towards reaping the rewards of co-design in real world domains.

TL;DR: A new gradient estimation method using forward-mode automatic differentiation that reduces bias and variance by manipulating upstream Jacobian matrices, showing better performance with wider networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation requires two passes and stores intermediate activations, while existing forward-mode methods have high variance and bias issues that limit scalability.

Method: Manipulate upstream Jacobian matrices when computing guess directions to reduce both bias and variance in gradient estimates.

Result: The method shows promising results and performs better as network width increases, with potential to scale to larger networks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses bias and variance issues in forward-mode gradient estimation, with performance improving with network width due to low-dimensional structure of neural network gradients.

Abstract: While backpropagation--reverse-mode automatic differentiation--has been
extraordinarily successful in deep learning, it requires two passes (forward
and backward) through the neural network and the storage of intermediate
activations. Existing gradient estimation methods that instead use forward-mode
automatic differentiation struggle to scale beyond small networks due to the
high variance of the estimates. Efforts to mitigate this have so far introduced
significant bias to the estimates, reducing their utility. We introduce a
gradient estimation approach that reduces both bias and variance by
manipulating upstream Jacobian matrices when computing guess directions. It
shows promising results and has the potential to scale to larger networks,
indeed performing better as the network width is increased. Our understanding
of this method is facilitated by analyses of bias and variance, and their
connection to the low-dimensional structure of neural network gradients.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FP-AbDiff is a physics-informed antibody generator that enforces Fokker-Planck Equation physics throughout the generative process, achieving state-of-the-art performance in computational antibody design with improved physical plausibility and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing antibody generative models suffer from lack of dynamical consistency (producing physically implausible structures) and poor generalization due to data scarcity and structural bias.

Method: FP-AbDiff enforces Fokker-Planck Equation physics along the entire generative trajectory by minimizing a novel FPE residual loss over the mixed manifold of CDR geometries (R^3 x SO(3)), integrated with deep biological priors in a SE(3)-equivariant diffusion framework.

Result: Achieves 0.99 Å RMSD in CDR-H3 design (25% improvement over AbX), 39.91% Contact Amino Acid Recovery, and in six-CDR co-design cuts full-chain RMSD by ~15% with 45.67% Amino Acid Recovery on CDR-H3.

Conclusion: By aligning generative dynamics with physical laws, FP-AbDiff enhances robustness and generalizability, establishing a principled approach for physically faithful and functionally viable antibody design.

Abstract: Computational antibody design holds immense promise for therapeutic
discovery, yet existing generative models are fundamentally limited by two core
challenges: (i) a lack of dynamical consistency, which yields physically
implausible structures, and (ii) poor generalization due to data scarcity and
structural bias. We introduce FP-AbDiff, the first antibody generator to
enforce Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) physics along the entire generative
trajectory. Our method minimizes a novel FPE residual loss over the mixed
manifold of CDR geometries (R^3 x SO(3)), compelling locally-learned denoising
scores to assemble into a globally coherent probability flow. This
physics-informed regularizer is synergistically integrated with deep biological
priors within a state-of-the-art SE(3)-equivariant diffusion framework.
Rigorous evaluation on the RAbD benchmark confirms that FP-AbDiff establishes a
new state-of-the-art. In de novo CDR-H3 design, it achieves a mean Root Mean
Square Deviation of 0.99 {\AA} when superposing on the variable region, a 25%
improvement over the previous state-of-the-art model, AbX, and the highest
reported Contact Amino Acid Recovery of 39.91%. This superiority is underscored
in the more challenging six-CDR co-design task, where our model delivers
consistently superior geometric precision, cutting the average full-chain Root
Mean Square Deviation by ~15%, and crucially, achieves the highest full-chain
Amino Acid Recovery on the functionally dominant CDR-H3 loop (45.67%). By
aligning generative dynamics with physical laws, FP-AbDiff enhances robustness
and generalizability, establishing a principled approach for physically
faithful and functionally viable antibody design.

*Qi Zhang,Yifei Wang,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical analysis of self-supervised contrastive learning, deriving tight bounds under conditional independence and more practical augmentation overlap assumptions, and proposes an unsupervised evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying working mechanism of self-supervised contrastive learning, which has achieved great success but lacks clear theoretical explanation.

Method: First derives tight bounds using conditional independence assumption, then relaxes to more practical augmentation overlap assumption and derives asymptotically closed bounds. Proposes augmentation overlap theory and develops unsupervised evaluation metric.

Result: Shows that aggressive data augmentations make intra-class sample supports more overlapped, enabling contrastive learning to cluster intra-class samples by simply aligning positive samples. The proposed unsupervised metric aligns well with downstream performance.

Conclusion: Augmentation overlap provides a practical theoretical framework for understanding contrastive learning, and the proposed evaluation metric effectively assesses representation quality without additional modules.

Abstract: Recently, self-supervised contrastive learning has achieved great success on
various tasks. However, its underlying working mechanism is yet unclear. In
this paper, we first provide the tightest bounds based on the widely adopted
assumption of conditional independence. Further, we relax the conditional
independence assumption to a more practical assumption of augmentation overlap
and derive the asymptotically closed bounds for the downstream performance. Our
proposed augmentation overlap theory hinges on the insight that the support of
different intra-class samples will become more overlapped under aggressive data
augmentations, thus simply aligning the positive samples (augmented views of
the same sample) could make contrastive learning cluster intra-class samples
together. Moreover, from the newly derived augmentation overlap perspective, we
develop an unsupervised metric for the representation evaluation of contrastive
learning, which aligns well with the downstream performance almost without
relying on additional modules. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To thoroughly assess LLM robustness against adversarial inputs in sensitive tasks, despite their strong zero-shot performance without training/fine-tuning.

Method: Leverage LLM understanding to create subtle, natural-looking adversarial examples that preserve semantic similarity while deceiving target LLMs, using automated LLM-driven pipelines without external heuristics.

Result: Generated adversarial inputs effectively deceive target LLMs, demonstrate strong transferability across unknown models, and evolve with LLM advancements.

Conclusion: Provides a systematic approach for self-assessment of LLM robustness against adversarial attacks, with released code and data for community use.

Abstract: LLMs can provide substantial zero-shot performance on diverse tasks using a
simple task prompt, eliminating the need for training or fine-tuning. However,
when applying these models to sensitive tasks, it is crucial to thoroughly
assess their robustness against adversarial inputs. In this work, we introduce
Static Deceptor (StaDec) and Dynamic Deceptor (DyDec), two innovative attack
frameworks designed to systematically generate dynamic and adaptive adversarial
examples by leveraging the understanding of the LLMs. We produce subtle and
natural-looking adversarial inputs that preserve semantic similarity to the
original text while effectively deceiving the target LLM. By utilizing an
automated, LLM-driven pipeline, we eliminate the dependence on external
heuristics. Our attacks evolve with the advancements in LLMs and demonstrate
strong transferability across models unknown to the attacker. Overall, this
work provides a systematic approach for the self-assessment of an LLM's
robustness. We release our code and data at

Motivation: Conventional domain adaptation methods require target domain knowledge or model retraining, limiting practicality in dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Quantile Recalibration (AQR) that modifies pre-activation distributions by aligning quantiles channel-wise, capturing full distribution shapes. Includes robust tail calibration for stability under varying batch sizes, using source-domain statistics without retraining.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C across multiple architectures show AQR achieves robust adaptation across diverse settings and outperforms existing test-time adaptation baselines.

Conclusion: AQR demonstrates strong potential for deployment in real-world scenarios with dynamic and unpredictable data distributions, providing effective unsupervised adaptation without model retraining.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a key strategy for enhancing the generalizability of
deep learning models in real-world scenarios, where test distributions often
diverge significantly from the training domain. However, conventional
approaches typically rely on prior knowledge of the target domain or require
model retraining, limiting their practicality in dynamic or
resource-constrained environments. Recent test-time adaptation methods based on
batch normalization statistic updates allow for unsupervised adaptation, but
they often fail to capture complex activation distributions and are constrained
to specific normalization layers. We propose Adaptive Quantile Recalibration
(AQR), a test-time adaptation technique that modifies pre-activation
distributions by aligning quantiles on a channel-wise basis. AQR captures the
full shape of activation distributions and generalizes across architectures
employing BatchNorm, GroupNorm, or LayerNorm. To address the challenge of
estimating distribution tails under varying batch sizes, AQR incorporates a
robust tail calibration strategy that improves stability and precision. Our
method leverages source-domain statistics computed at training time, enabling
unsupervised adaptation without retraining models. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C,
CIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C across multiple architectures demonstrate that AQR
achieves robust adaptation across diverse settings, outperforming existing
test-time adaptation baselines. These results highlight AQR's potential for
deployment in real-world scenarios with dynamic and unpredictable data
distributions.

*Atif Hassan,Tarun Kumar,Ashish Mishra,Sergey Serebryakov,Satish Kumar Mopur,Phanidhar Koganti,Murthy Chelankuri,Ramanagopal Vogety,Suparna Bhattacharya,Martin Foltin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: F2A is a framework that enables Time Series Foundation Models to perform zero-shot anomaly prediction through joint forecast-anomaly loss and retrieval-augmented generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly prediction methods fail to generalize across systems and evolving anomaly patterns, while pretrained Time Series Foundation Models have strong generalization capabilities but haven't been adapted for anomaly prediction tasks.

Method: F2A uses two key innovations: 1) joint forecast-anomaly loss that fine-tunes TSFMs to forecast signals at anomalous points, and 2) RAG module that retrieves relevant historical horizons and conditions predictions on them for dynamic adaptation to distribution shifts.

Result: Extensive experiments across 16 diverse datasets and multiple TSFM backbones show F2A consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing scalable zero-shot anomaly prediction.

Conclusion: F2A successfully bridges the gap between robust TSFM zero-shot forecasting and zero-shot anomaly prediction, offering a practical solution for real-world applications without requiring model updates.

Abstract: Forecasting anomalies (anomaly prediction) in multivariate time series from
different real-world, dynamic, and complex systems is vital for preempting
critical failures, leading to a substantial minimization in operational costs
and human labor. Yet, existing methods are limited to specific systems while
failing to generalize to evolving anomaly patterns over time. In contrast,
pretrained Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently demonstrated
strong generalization and zero-shot forecasting capabilities. However, their
potential remains untapped for anomaly prediction, a task fundamentally
different from forecasting normal behavior. Thus, we present Forecast2Anomaly
(F2A), a novel framework that empowers TSFMs with anomaly prediction abilities
through two key innovations. First, we propose a joint forecast-anomaly loss
that fine-tunes TSFMs to accurately forecast future signals even at anomalous
time points. Second, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module
that retrieves historically relevant horizons and conditions predictions on
them. This component dynamically adapts to distributional shifts at inference
time, enabling F2A to track evolving anomalies without requiring model updates.
By combining targeted fine-tuning with dynamic retrieval, F2A bridges the gap
between robust TSFM zero-shot forecasting and zero-shot anomaly prediction.
Extensive experiments across 16 diverse datasets and multiple TSFM backbones
show that F2A consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a
scalable, zero-shot anomaly prediction solution for real-world applications.

*Tingzhu Bi,Yicheng Pan,Xinrui Jiang,Huize Sun,Meng Ma,Ping Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UnCLe is a deep learning method for dynamic causal discovery that uses Uncoupler and Recoupler networks to learn time-varying causal relationships from observational time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods mainly infer static causal graphs, but real-world systems often exhibit dynamic causality where relationships evolve over time, requiring time-resolved causal graphs.

Method: Uses Uncoupler and Recoupler networks to disentangle time series into semantic representations, learns inter-variable dependencies via auto-regressive Dependency Matrices, and estimates dynamic causal influences through datapoint-wise prediction errors from temporal perturbations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on static causal discovery benchmarks and uniquely captures evolving temporal causality in both synthetic and real-world dynamic systems like human motion.

Conclusion: UnCLe offers a promising approach for revealing the underlying, time-varying mechanisms of complex phenomena through scalable dynamic causal discovery.

Abstract: Uncovering cause-effect relationships from observational time series is
fundamental to understanding complex systems. While many methods infer static
causal graphs, real-world systems often exhibit dynamic causality-where
relationships evolve over time. Accurately capturing these temporal dynamics
requires time-resolved causal graphs. We propose UnCLe, a novel deep learning
method for scalable dynamic causal discovery. UnCLe employs a pair of Uncoupler
and Recoupler networks to disentangle input time series into semantic
representations and learns inter-variable dependencies via auto-regressive
Dependency Matrices. It estimates dynamic causal influences by analyzing
datapoint-wise prediction errors induced by temporal perturbations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that UnCLe not only outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines on static causal discovery benchmarks but, more importantly, exhibits
a unique capability to accurately capture and represent evolving temporal
causality in both synthetic and real-world dynamic systems (e.g., human
motion). UnCLe offers a promising approach for revealing the underlying,
time-varying mechanisms of complex phenomena.

*Jonghae Park,Daesol Cho,Jusuk Lee,Dongseok Shim,Inkyu Jang,H. Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PSD is an unsupervised RL framework that discovers diverse periodic skills by mapping states to a circular latent space, enabling effective learning of behaviors with varying periods for complex robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised skill discovery methods overlook periodic nature of behaviors, while many robotic tasks (especially locomotion) require periodic behaviors across different timescales.

Method: Train an encoder to map states to a circular latent space that naturally encodes periodicity, capturing temporal distance to learn skills with diverse periods.

Result: PSD effectively learns periodic skills in complex robotic tasks with pixel-based observations, achieves high performance on downstream tasks like hurdling, and when integrated with existing methods provides more diverse behaviors.

Conclusion: PSD successfully discovers diverse periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner, broadening agents' behavioral repertoire for robotic applications requiring periodic motion.

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn
diverse behaviors without relying on external rewards. However, current methods
often overlook the periodic nature of learned skills, focusing instead on
increasing the mutual dependence between states and skills or maximizing the
distance traveled in latent space. Considering that many robotic tasks --
particularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across
varying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is
essential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a
framework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner. The key
idea of PSD is to train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space,
thereby naturally encoding periodicity in the latent representation. By
capturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse
periods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations. We
further show that these learned skills achieve high performance on downstream
tasks such as hurdling. Moreover, integrating PSD with an existing skill
discovery method offers more diverse behaviors, thus broadening the agent's
repertoire. Our code and demos are available at

### [102] [Efficient Linear Attention for Multivariate Time Series Modeling via Entropy Equality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03190)
*Mingtao Zhang,Guoli Yang,Zhanxing Zhu,Mengzhu Wang,Xiaoying Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel linear attention mechanism that uses entropy-based approximation to achieve linear computational complexity while maintaining competitive performance in spatio-temporal time series modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard attention mechanisms suffer from quadratic computational complexity that limits scalability for long sequences, despite their effectiveness in capturing complex dependencies.

Method: Developed a linear attention mechanism based on theoretical insight that entropy (as strictly concave function) implies structural similarity between distributions with aligned probability rankings and similar entropy. Uses efficient entropy approximation algorithm with linear complexity.

Result: Extensive experiments on four spatio-temporal datasets show competitive or superior forecasting performance with substantial reductions in memory usage and computational time compared to traditional attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: Effectiveness of attention in spatio-temporal modeling may stem more from achieving moderate, well-balanced weight distributions rather than softmax non-linearity, enabling efficient linear attention alternatives.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have been extensively employed in various applications,
including time series modeling, owing to their capacity to capture intricate
dependencies; however, their utility is often constrained by quadratic
computational complexity, which impedes scalability for long sequences. In this
work, we propose a novel linear attention mechanism designed to overcome these
limitations. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical demonstration that
entropy, as a strictly concave function on the probability simplex, implies
that distributions with aligned probability rankings and similar entropy values
exhibit structural resemblance. Building on this insight, we develop an
efficient approximation algorithm that computes the entropy of
dot-product-derived distributions with only linear complexity, enabling the
implementation of a linear attention mechanism based on entropy equality.
Through rigorous analysis, we reveal that the effectiveness of attention in
spatio-temporal time series modeling may not primarily stem from the
non-linearity of softmax but rather from the attainment of a moderate and
well-balanced weight distribution. Extensive experiments on four
spatio-temporal datasets validate our method, demonstrating competitive or
superior forecasting performance while achieving substantial reductions in both
memory usage and computational time.

*Feng Wu,Tsai Hor Chan,Fuying Wang,Guosheng Yin,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel copula-driven multimodal learning framework that models complex interactions between different data modalities using copula theory to align marginal distributions and generate accurate representations for missing modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications often involve multiple data modalities (e.g., EHRs, medical images, clinical notes), but existing multimodal learning methods oversimplify interaction structures between modalities using concatenation or Kronecker product, failing to capture complex higher-order interactions.

Method: Proposes a copula-driven framework that interprets copula models as tools to efficiently align marginal distributions of modalities. Assumes Gaussian mixture distribution for each modality and applies copula model on the joint distribution to capture complex interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments on public MIMIC datasets demonstrate superior performance over competitors. The model effectively generates accurate representations for missing modalities.

Conclusion: The copula-driven multimodal learning framework successfully captures complex interactions among different modalities and provides an effective solution for handling missing modalities in real-world applications.

Abstract: Various data modalities are common in real-world applications (e.g.,
electronic health records, medical images and clinical notes in healthcare). It
is essential to develop multimodal learning methods to aggregate various
information from multiple modalities. The main challenge is how to
appropriately align and fuse the representations of different modalities into a
joint distribution. Existing methods mainly rely on concatenation or the
Kronecker product, oversimplifying the interaction structure between modalities
and indicating a need to model more complex interactions. Additionally, the
joint distribution of latent representations with higher-order interactions is
underexplored. Copula is a powerful statistical structure for modelling the
interactions among variables, as it naturally bridges the joint distribution
and marginal distributions of multiple variables. We propose a novel
copula-driven multimodal learning framework, which focuses on learning the
joint distribution of various modalities to capture the complex interactions
among them. The key idea is to interpret the copula model as a tool to align
the marginal distributions of the modalities efficiently. By assuming a
Gaussian mixture distribution for each modality and a copula model on the joint
distribution, our model can generate accurate representations for missing
modalities. Extensive experiments on public MIMIC datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of our model over other competitors. The code is available

TL;DR: Adapted probabilistic U-Net for statistical downscaling of climate data from 16x coarser resolution, comparing four training objectives for precipitation and temperature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate models produce coarse outputs, but impact studies need finer scales. Statistical downscaling bridges this resolution gap.

Method: Used probabilistic U-Net with deterministic backbone and variational latent space to capture uncertainty. Evaluated four training objectives: afCRPS and WMSE-MS-SSIM with three settings.

Result: WMSE-MS-SSIM performs well for extremes under certain settings, while afCRPS better captures spatial variability across scales.

Conclusion: Different training objectives excel at different aspects - WMSE-MS-SSIM for extremes and afCRPS for spatial variability, providing guidance for climate downscaling applications.

Abstract: Climate models are limited by heavy computational costs, often producing
outputs at coarse spatial resolutions, while many climate change impact studies
require finer scales. Statistical downscaling bridges this gap, and we adapt
the probabilistic U-Net for this task, combining a deterministic U-Net backbone
with a variational latent space to capture aleatoric uncertainty. We evaluate
four training objectives, afCRPS and WMSE-MS-SSIM with three settings for
downscaling precipitation and temperature from $16\times$ coarser resolution.
Our main finding is that WMSE-MS-SSIM performs well for extremes under certain
settings, whereas afCRPS better captures spatial variability across scales.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a VAE-MLP framework for lightweight IoT botnet detection, evaluating two quantization strategies (QAT and PTQ) that achieve significant speedup and compression while maintaining good detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational intensity of deep learning methods that prevents deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices, creating a need for lightweight detection models.

Method: VAE-MLP model framework using MLP classifier trained on 8-dimensional latent vectors from pretrained VAE encoder, with systematic evaluation of Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) strategies.

Result: PTQ showed only marginal accuracy reduction with 6x speedup and 21x size reduction, while QAT had more noticeable accuracy decline but achieved 3x speedup and 24x compression on N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022 datasets.

Conclusion: Quantization is practical for device-level IoT botnet detection, with PTQ performing better than QAT in terms of accuracy preservation while achieving significant efficiency improvements.

Abstract: In an effort to counter the increasing IoT botnet-based attacks,
state-of-the-art deep learning methods have been proposed and have achieved
impressive detection accuracy. However, their computational intensity restricts
deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices, creating a critical need for
lightweight detection models. A common solution to this challenge is model
compression via quantization. This study proposes a VAE-MLP model framework
where an MLP-based classifier is trained on 8-dimensional latent vectors
derived from the high-dimensional train data using the encoder component of a
pretrained variational autoencoder (VAE). Two widely used quantization
strategies--Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization
(PTQ)--are then systematically evaluated in terms of their impact on detection
performance, storage efficiency, and inference latency using two benchmark IoT
botnet datasets--N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022. The results revealed that, with
respect to detection accuracy, the QAT strategy experienced a more noticeable
decline,whereas PTQ incurred only a marginal reduction compared to the original
unquantized model. Furthermore, PTQ yielded a 6x speedup and 21x reduction in
size, while QAT achieved a 3x speedup and 24x compression, demonstrating the
practicality of quantization for device-level IoT botnet detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using Reinforcement Learning to identify optimal climate adaptation pathways that maximize urban Quality of Life under uncertain climate change and urban flooding scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban flooding is increasing due to climate change, negatively impacting Quality of Life. Policymakers need adaptation strategies that can handle climate uncertainty and the complex dynamics of urban flooding.

Method: Developed an Integrated Assessment Model combining rainfall projections, flood modeling, transport accessibility, and QoL index, then applied Reinforcement Learning to identify optimal adaptation pathways.

Result: Preliminary results show this approach can learn optimal adaptation measures and outperforms realistic and real-world planning strategies.

Conclusion: The RL-based framework successfully identifies climate adaptation pathways that lead to higher long-term urban Quality of Life, providing a valuable tool for policymakers dealing with uncertain climate impacts.

Abstract: Urban flooding is expected to increase in frequency and severity as a
consequence of climate change, causing wide-ranging impacts that include a
decrease in urban Quality of Life (QoL). Meanwhile, policymakers must devise
adaptation strategies that can cope with the uncertain nature of climate change
and the complex and dynamic nature of urban flooding. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) holds significant promise in tackling such complex, dynamic, and uncertain
problems. Because of this, we use RL to identify which climate adaptation
pathways lead to a higher QoL in the long term. We do this using an Integrated
Assessment Model (IAM) which combines a rainfall projection model, a flood
model, a transport accessibility model, and a quality of life index. Our
preliminary results suggest that this approach can be used to learn optimal
adaptation measures and it outperforms other realistic and real-world planning
strategies. Our framework is publicly available:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FCDC introduces closed-loop control for data collection, using online probabilistic models to dynamically regulate sample retention and prevent redundancy, achieving 25.9% more balanced datasets with 39.8% storage reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI systems are constrained by data quality and diversity rather than model capacity. Current open-loop data collection accumulates redundant samples inefficiently, leading to costly labeling and limited generalization.

Method: FCDC formulates data collection as a closed-loop control problem, using online probabilistic models to approximate data distribution state and adaptively regulate sample retention based on feedback signals like likelihood and Mahalanobis distance.

Result: Experiments show FCDC produces 25.9% more balanced datasets while reducing data storage by 39.8%, demonstrating effective dynamic balance between exploration and exploitation.

Conclusion: Data collection can be actively controlled, transforming it from a passive pipeline stage into a self-regulating, feedback-driven process at the core of data-centric AI.

Abstract: Modern AI systems are increasingly constrained not by model capacity but by
the quality and diversity of their data. Despite growing emphasis on
data-centric AI, most datasets are still gathered in an open-loop manner which
accumulates redundant samples without feedback from the current coverage. This
results in inefficient storage, costly labeling, and limited generalization. To
address this, this paper introduces \ac{FCDC}, a paradigm that formulates data
collection as a closed-loop control problem. \ac{FCDC} continuously
approximates the state of the collected data distribution using an online
probabilistic model and adaptively regulates sample retention using based on
feedback signals such as likelihood and Mahalanobis distance. Through this
feedback mechanism, the system dynamically balances exploration and
exploitation, maintains dataset diversity, and prevents redundancy from
accumulating over time. Besides showcasing the controllability of \ac{FCDC} on
a synthetic dataset, experiments on a real data stream show that \ac{FCDC}
produces more balanced datasets by $\SI{25.9}{\percent}$ while reducing data
storage by $\SI{39.8}{\percent}$. These results demonstrate that data
collection itself can be actively controlled, transforming collection from a
passive pipeline stage into a self-regulating, feedback-driven process at the
core of data-centric AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IGNO is a novel generative neural operator framework that solves inverse PDE problems without labeled data, handling both point measurements and operator-valued data through latent space encoding and physics-constrained training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for inverse PDE problems require extensive labeled datasets or are limited to specific measurement types, failing in challenging regimes with sparse/noisy data or discontinuous coefficients.

Method: IGNO encodes high-dimensional coefficient fields into low-dimensional latent space, uses neural operator decoders for reconstruction, trains via physics constraints (PDE residuals), and performs inversion through gradient-based optimization in latent space accelerated by normalizing flow.

Result: IGNO achieves accurate, stable, and scalable inversion across diverse challenging problems including discontinuous coefficient recovery and EIT, outperforming state-of-the-art methods under varying noise levels and showing strong generalization to out-of-distribution targets.

Conclusion: IGNO establishes a unified and powerful framework for tackling challenging inverse problems across computational science domains, overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
central to science and engineering, yet remains challenging when measurements
are sparse, noisy, or when the underlying coefficients are high-dimensional or
discontinuous. Existing deep learning approaches either require extensive
labeled datasets or are limited to specific measurement types, often leading to
failure in such regimes and restricting their practical applicability. Here, a
novel generative neural operator framework, IGNO, is introduced to overcome
these limitations. IGNO unifies the solution of inverse problems from both
point measurements and operator-valued data without labeled training pairs.
This framework encodes high-dimensional, potentially discontinuous coefficient
fields into a low-dimensional latent space, which drives neural operator
decoders to reconstruct both coefficients and PDE solutions. Training relies
purely on physics constraints through PDE residuals, while inversion proceeds
via efficient gradient-based optimization in latent space, accelerated by an a
priori normalizing flow model. Across a diverse set of challenging inverse
problems, including recovery of discontinuous coefficients from solution-based
measurements and the EIT problem with operator-based measurements, IGNO
consistently achieves accurate, stable, and scalable inversion even under
severe noise. It consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method under
varying noise levels and demonstrates strong generalization to
out-of-distribution targets. These results establish IGNO as a unified and
powerful framework for tackling challenging inverse problems across
computational science domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-based framework for flood adaptation policymaking that models different priorities (economic vs. wellbeing) under climate uncertainty, showing QoL-focused policies lead to more even spending distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address climate change-induced flood risks by managing uncertainty in long-term impacts and making explicit normative choices in adaptation policies.

Method: Use Reinforcement Learning with Integrated Assessment Model linking rainfall/flood models to compute QoL, transportation, and infrastructure impacts.

Result: QoL-prioritizing models result in higher adaptation spending and more even distribution across study areas compared to economic-focused approaches.

Conclusion: Normative assumptions significantly influence adaptation policy design, and RL provides useful framework for explicit modeling and comparison of different priorities.

Abstract: Climate change will cause an increase in the frequency and severity of flood
events, prompting the need for cohesive adaptation policymaking. Designing
effective adaptation policies, however, depends on managing the uncertainty of
long-term climate impacts. Meanwhile, such policies can feature important
normative choices that are not always made explicit. We propose that
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be a useful tool to both identify adaptation
pathways under uncertain conditions while it also allows for the explicit
modelling (and consequent comparison) of different adaptation priorities (e.g.
economic vs. wellbeing). We use an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) to link
together a rainfall and flood model, and compute the impacts of flooding in
terms of quality of life (QoL), transportation, and infrastructure damage. Our
results show that models prioritising QoL over economic impacts results in more
adaptation spending as well as a more even distribution of spending over the
study area, highlighting the extent to which such normative assumptions can
alter adaptation policy. Our framework is publicly available:

TL;DR: GMoPE is a novel framework that combines Mixture-of-Experts architecture with prompt-based learning for graphs, enabling efficient specialization across domains while reducing adaptation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs struggle with generalization across diverse domains due to negative transfer, scalability issues, and high adaptation costs, limiting their effectiveness as foundation models.

Method: Integrates MoE with prompt-based learning using expert-specific prompt vectors and structure-aware routing, with soft orthogonality constraints to prevent expert collapse and promote specialization.

Result: Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieves performance comparable to full parameter fine-tuning while requiring significantly less adaptation overhead.

Conclusion: Provides a principled and scalable framework for advancing generalizable and efficient graph foundation models through expert specialization and efficient transfer learning.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
task-specific benchmarks, yet their ability to generalize across diverse
domains and tasks remains limited. Existing approaches often struggle with
negative transfer, scalability issues, and high adaptation costs. To address
these challenges, we propose GMoPE (Graph Mixture of Prompt-Experts), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with prompt-based learning for graphs. GMoPE leverages expert-specific prompt
vectors and structure-aware MoE routing to enable each expert to specialize in
distinct subdomains and dynamically contribute to predictions. To promote
diversity and prevent expert collapse, we introduce a soft orthogonality
constraint across prompt vectors, encouraging expert specialization and
facilitating a more balanced expert utilization. Additionally, we adopt a
prompt-only fine-tuning strategy that significantly reduces spatiotemporal
complexity during transfer. We validate GMoPE through extensive experiments
under various pretraining strategies and multiple downstream tasks. Results
show that GMoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves performance comparable to full parameter fine-tuning-while requiring
only a fraction of the adaptation overhead. Our work provides a principled and
scalable framework for advancing generalizable and efficient graph foundation
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion language models (DLMs) can outperform autoregressive models when data is limited by training for more epochs, with gains attributed to any-order modeling, super-dense compute from iterative denoising, and built-in data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how diffusion language models perform compared to autoregressive models under data-constrained pre-training scenarios, particularly when unique training data is limited.

Method: Used strictly controlled pre-training settings with DLMs and AR models, testing across different data quantities, model sizes, and architectures. Analyzed factors contributing to DLM performance including any-order modeling, iterative bidirectional denoising, and built-in Monte Carlo augmentation.

Result: DLMs consistently surpassed AR models when unique data was limited by training for more epochs. A 1.7B DLM trained on 10B unique Python tokens overtook an AR coder with matched settings. A 1B-parameter DLM achieved >56% accuracy on HellaSwag and >33% on MMLU using only 1B tokens through data repetition.

Conclusion: DLMs show superior performance over AR models in data-constrained settings, with validation cross-entropy not necessarily indicating degraded downstream performance in this regime.

Abstract: Under strictly controlled pre-training settings, we observe a Crossover: when
unique data is limited, diffusion language models (DLMs) consistently surpass
autoregressive (AR) models by training for more epochs. The crossover shifts
later with more or higher-quality data, earlier with larger models, and
persists across dense and sparse architectures. We attribute the gains to three
compounding factors: (1) any-order modeling, (2) super-dense compute from
iterative bidirectional denoising, and (3) built-in Monte Carlo augmentation;
input or parameter noise improves AR under data constraint but cannot close the
gap. At scale, a 1.7B DLM trained with a ~1.5T-token compute budget on 10B
unique Python tokens overtakes an AR coder trained with strictly matched
settings. In addition, a 1B-parameter DLM achieves > 56% accuracy on HellaSwag
and > 33% on MMLU using only 1B tokens, without any special tricks, just by
repeating standard pre-training data. We also show that rising validation
cross-entropy does not imply degraded downstream performance in this regime.

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive API rate limiting strategy using deep reinforcement learning (DQN + A3C) that dynamically balances throughput and latency, achieving significant improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rate limiting algorithms struggle with dynamic traffic patterns and varying system loads in cloud computing and microservice architectures, necessitating more adaptive solutions.

Method: Hybrid architecture combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms, modeling rate limiting as a Markov Decision Process that continuously learns from environmental interaction.

Result: 23.7% throughput improvement and 31.4% P99 latency reduction compared to traditional methods; 82% reduction in service degradation incidents and 68% decrease in manual interventions in production deployment.

Conclusion: The deep reinforcement learning-based adaptive rate limiting strategy effectively handles dynamic traffic patterns and significantly improves system performance and stability in production environments.

Abstract: As cloud computing and microservice architectures become increasingly
prevalent, API rate limiting has emerged as a critical mechanism for ensuring
system stability and service quality. Traditional rate limiting algorithms,
such as token bucket and sliding window, while widely adopted, struggle to
adapt to dynamic traffic patterns and varying system loads. This paper proposes
an adaptive rate limiting strategy based on deep reinforcement learning that
dynamically balances system throughput and service latency. We design a hybrid
architecture combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Asynchronous Advantage
Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms, modeling the rate limiting decision process as a
Markov Decision Process. The system continuously monitors microservice states
and learns optimal rate limiting policies through environmental interaction.
Extensive experiments conducted in a Kubernetes cluster environment demonstrate
that our approach achieves 23.7% throughput improvement and 31.4% P99 latency
reduction compared to traditional fixed-threshold strategies under high-load
scenarios. Results from a 90-day production deployment handling 500 million
daily requests validate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method,
with 82% reduction in service degradation incidents and 68% decrease in manual
interventions.

### [113] [A Probabilistic Approach to Pose Synchronization for Multi-Reference Alignment with Applications to MIMO Wireless Communication Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03280)
*Rob Romijnders,Gabriele Cesa,Christos Louizos,Kumar Pratik,Arash Behboodi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A probabilistic approach to multi-reference alignment (MRA) that marginalizes out relative poses as nuisance variables, removing global symmetries and enabling more direct solutions with improved convergence and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-reference alignment is crucial in various applications like molecular imaging, cryo-EM, computer vision, and wireless communications, where aligning and reconstructing signals from multiple misaligned observations is essential for system performance.

Method: Probabilistic modeling of MRA that treats relative poses as nuisance variables to marginalize out, removing global symmetries. Uses decentralization through cycle consistency to avoid cubic scaling of centralized methods.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieve lower reconstruction error across experimental settings and enable significant computational savings.

Conclusion: The probabilistic approach with nuisance variable marginalization effectively addresses MRA problems by removing global symmetries, leading to improved convergence, computational efficiency, and better reconstruction performance.

Abstract: From molecular imaging to wireless communications, the ability to align and
reconstruct signals from multiple misaligned observations is crucial for system
performance. We study the problem of multi-reference alignment (MRA), which
arises in many real-world problems, such as cryo-EM, computer vision, and, in
particular, wireless communication systems. Using a probabilistic approach to
model MRA, we find a new algorithm that uses relative poses as nuisance
variables to marginalize out -- thereby removing the global symmetries of the
problem and allowing for more direct solutions and improved convergence. The
decentralization of this approach enables significant computational savings by
avoiding the cubic scaling of centralized methods through cycle consistency.
Both proposed algorithms achieve lower reconstruction error across experimental
settings.

*Qingyuan Zhang,Ning Lyu,Le Liu,Yuxi Wang,Ziyu Cheng,Cancan Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework combining graph neural networks and temporal modeling for anomaly detection and root cause tracing in microservice architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting anomalies and tracing root causes in complex microservice architectures with dynamic topologies and temporal dependencies.

Method: Abstracts microservice call chains as directed graphs, uses graph convolution to model structural dependencies, integrates gated recurrent units for temporal modeling, and defines anomaly scoring functions at node and path levels.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods in AUC, ACC, Recall, and F1-Score metrics, maintaining high accuracy and stability under dynamic topologies and complex environments.

Conclusion: Provides a new technical path for microservice anomaly detection and lays a methodological foundation for intelligent operations in distributed systems.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of anomaly detection and root cause tracing
in microservice architectures and proposes a unified framework that combines
graph neural networks with temporal modeling. The microservice call chain is
abstracted as a directed graph, where multidimensional features of nodes and
edges are used to construct a service topology representation, and graph
convolution is applied to aggregate features across nodes and model
dependencies, capturing complex structural relationships among services. On
this basis, gated recurrent units are introduced to model the temporal
evolution of call chains, and multi-layer stacking and concatenation operations
are used to jointly obtain structural and temporal representations, improving
the ability to identify anomaly patterns. Furthermore, anomaly scoring
functions at both the node and path levels are defined to achieve unified
modeling from local anomaly detection to global call chain tracing, which
enables the identification of abnormal service nodes and the reconstruction of
potential anomaly propagation paths. Sensitivity experiments are then designed
from multiple dimensions, including hyperparameters, environmental
disturbances, and data distribution, to evaluate the framework, and results
show that it outperforms baseline methods in key metrics such as AUC, ACC,
Recall, and F1-Score, maintaining high accuracy and stability under dynamic
topologies and complex environments. This research not only provides a new
technical path for anomaly detection in microservices but also lays a
methodological foundation for intelligent operations in distributed systems.

### [115] [Extending Fair Null-Space Projections for Continuous Attributes to Kernel Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03304)
*Felix Störck,Fabian Hinder,Barbara Hammer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for continuous fairness in machine learning by generalizing iterative null-space projection to kernel methods, enabling fair regression with continuous protected attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing integration of ML systems in social life, fairness becomes crucial. Current literature focuses mainly on discrete attributes, while continuous fairness (especially in regression) is under-explored.

Method: Generalizes iterative null-space projection to kernel methods, creating a model-agnostic approach for kernel embeddings that handles continuous protected attributes. Applied with Support Vector Regression (SVR).

Result: The method provides competitive or improved performance across multiple datasets compared to other contemporary fairness methods.

Conclusion: The kernel-based approach significantly extends the scope of continuous fairness applications and demonstrates effective performance in fair regression tasks.

Abstract: With the on-going integration of machine learning systems into the everyday
social life of millions the notion of fairness becomes an ever increasing
priority in their development. Fairness notions commonly rely on protected
attributes to assess potential biases. Here, the majority of literature focuses
on discrete setups regarding both target and protected attributes. The
literature on continuous attributes especially in conjunction with regression
-- we refer to this as \emph{continuous fairness} -- is scarce. A common
strategy is iterative null-space projection which as of now has only been
explored for linear models or embeddings such as obtained by a non-linear
encoder. We improve on this by generalizing to kernel methods, significantly
extending the scope. This yields a model and fairness-score agnostic method for
kernel embeddings applicable to continuous protected attributes. We demonstrate
that our novel approach in conjunction with Support Vector Regression (SVR)
provides competitive or improved performance across multiple datasets in
comparisons to other contemporary methods.

### [116] [SORTeD Rashomon Sets of Sparse Decision Trees: Anytime Enumeration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03344)
*Elif Arslan,Jacobus G. M. van der Linden,Serge Hoogendoorn,Marco Rinaldi,Emir Demirović*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SORTD is a scalable framework that efficiently enumerates trees in the Rashomon set (trees with similar performance but varying structures) in order of objective value, enabling anytime behavior and practical exploration of alternative interpretable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse decision trees are accurate and interpretable for high-stakes applications, but relying on a single 'best' tree limits analysis. Rashomon sets (multiple similarly-performing trees) can enhance variable importance analysis, enrich explanations, and allow users to choose trees based on preferences like fairness without hard-coding criteria.

Method: SORTD framework improves scalability by enumerating trees in the Rashomon set in order of objective value, supporting anytime behavior. It works with any separable and totally ordered objective and allows post-evaluation with other separable objectives.

Result: SORTD reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art methods, making Rashomon set exploration more practical for real-world applications.

Conclusion: SORTD advances the practicality of exploring Rashomon sets, enabling better variable importance analysis, enriched explanations, and user-driven tree selection based on preferences like fairness without compromising interpretability.

Abstract: Sparse decision tree learning provides accurate and interpretable predictive
models that are ideal for high-stakes applications by finding the single most
accurate tree within a (soft) size limit. Rather than relying on a single
"best" tree, Rashomon sets-trees with similar performance but varying
structures-can be used to enhance variable importance analysis, enrich
explanations, and enable users to choose simpler trees or those that satisfy
stakeholder preferences (e.g., fairness) without hard-coding such criteria into
the objective function. However, because finding the optimal tree is NP-hard,
enumerating the Rashomon set is inherently challenging. Therefore, we introduce
SORTD, a novel framework that improves scalability and enumerates trees in the
Rashomon set in order of the objective value, thus offering anytime behavior.
Our experiments show that SORTD reduces runtime by up to two orders of
magnitude compared with the state of the art. Moreover, SORTD can compute
Rashomon sets for any separable and totally ordered objective and supports
post-evaluating the set using other separable (and partially ordered)
objectives. Together, these advances make exploring Rashomon sets more
practical in real-world applications.

*Xiaocai Zhang,Hur Lim,Ke Wang,Zhe Xiao,Jing Wang,Kelvin Lee,Xiuju Fu,Zheng Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMTC is a modular, data-free pipeline for multi-label intention recognition in transportation AI, using LLM-generated synthetic queries, Sentence-T5 embeddings, and a novel online focal-contrastive loss to achieve state-of-the-art performance without manual data labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional intent recognition systems require large annotated datasets and struggle with fine-grained multi-label discrimination. This approach aims to eliminate costly data collection while improving multi-label intention understanding accuracy.

Method: Three-step pipeline: 1) Prompt engineering for LLM-generated synthetic queries in transport scenarios, 2) Sentence-T5 encoding for semantic embeddings, 3) Lightweight classifier training with novel online focal-contrastive loss that emphasizes hard samples and maximizes inter-class separability.

Result: DMTC achieves Hamming loss of 5.35% and AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers and LLM-based baselines. Sentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29%, and OFC loss provides additional 0.98% gain over standard contrastive objectives.

Conclusion: The system successfully routes user queries to task-specific modules in transportation domain, laying groundwork for fully autonomous, intention-aware agents without costly manual labeling.

Abstract: In this study, a modular, data-free pipeline for multi-label intention
recognition is proposed for agentic AI applications in transportation. Unlike
traditional intent recognition systems that depend on large, annotated corpora
and often struggle with fine-grained, multi-label discrimination, our approach
eliminates the need for costly data collection while enhancing the accuracy of
multi-label intention understanding. Specifically, the overall pipeline, named
DMTC, consists of three steps: 1) using prompt engineering to guide large
language models (LLMs) to generate diverse synthetic queries in different
transport scenarios; 2) encoding each textual query with a Sentence-T5 model to
obtain compact semantic embeddings; 3) training a lightweight classifier using
a novel online focal-contrastive (OFC) loss that emphasizes hard samples and
maximizes inter-class separability. The applicability of the proposed pipeline
is demonstrated in an agentic AI application in the maritime transportation
context. Extensive experiments show that DMTC achieves a Hamming loss of 5.35%
and an AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers
and recent end-to-end SOTA LLM-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that
Sentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29% over
alternative encoders, and integrating the OFC loss yields an additional 0.98%
gain compared to standard contrastive objectives. In conclusion, our system
seamlessly routes user queries to task-specific modules (e.g., ETA information,
traffic risk evaluation, and other typical scenarios in the transportation
domain), laying the groundwork for fully autonomous, intention-aware agents
without costly manual labelling.

*Hongrun Ren,Yun Xiong,Lei You,Yingying Wang,Haixu Xiong,Yangyong Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a unified data-model coupled market that treats dataset and model trading as a single system with bidirectional pricing propagation between data sellers, model producers, and model buyers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML model economy separates data and model transactions or uses broker-centric pipelines that favor one side, lacking simultaneous symmetric mechanisms across all market participants.

Method: Uses supply-side mapping to transform dataset payments into model quotations, and demand-side mapping with Shapley-based allocation to propagate buyer prices back to datasets, forming a closed loop linking four interactions.

Result: Proves the joint operator is a standard interference function (SIF), guaranteeing existence, uniqueness, and global convergence of equilibrium prices. Experiments show efficient convergence and improved fairness.

Conclusion: The proposed unified market mechanism enables simultaneous and symmetric pricing across data sellers, model producers, and model buyers with proven convergence properties and improved fairness.

Abstract: The rise of the machine learning (ML) model economy has intertwined markets
for training datasets and pre-trained models. However, most pricing approaches
still separate data and model transactions or rely on broker-centric pipelines
that favor one side. Recent studies of data markets with externalities capture
buyer interactions but do not yield a simultaneous and symmetric mechanism
across data sellers, model producers, and model buyers. We propose a unified
data-model coupled market that treats dataset and model trading as a single
system. A supply-side mapping transforms dataset payments into buyer-visible
model quotations, while a demand-side mapping propagates buyer prices back to
datasets through Shapley-based allocation. Together, they form a closed loop
that links four interactions: supply-demand propagation in both directions and
mutual coupling among buyers and among sellers. We prove that the joint
operator is a standard interference function (SIF), guaranteeing existence,
uniqueness, and global convergence of equilibrium prices. Experiments
demonstrate efficient convergence and improved fairness compared with
broker-centric and one-sided baselines. The code is available on

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptable HER integrates Hindsight Experience Replay with AlphaZero to improve training in sparse reward settings by relabeling unsuccessful trajectories as learning signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero's neural network training struggles in sparse reward environments, especially early on when the network lacks guidance. HER addresses this by repurposing failed trajectories.

Method: Proposes Adaptable HER framework that combines HER with AlphaZero, allowing flexible adjustments to goal relabeling, policy targets, and trajectory selection strategies.

Result: Experiments including equation discovery show Adaptable HER outperforms pure supervised or reinforcement learning approaches.

Conclusion: The flexibility to modify HER properties is beneficial and enhances AlphaZero performance in sparse reward settings.

Abstract: AlphaZero-like Monte Carlo Tree Search systems, originally introduced for
two-player games, dynamically balance exploration and exploitation using neural
network guidance. This combination makes them also suitable for classical
search problems. However, the original method of training the network with
simulation results is limited in sparse reward settings, especially in the
early stages, where the network cannot yet give guidance. Hindsight Experience
Replay (HER) addresses this issue by relabeling unsuccessful trajectories from
the search tree as supervised learning signals. We introduce Adaptable HER
(\ours{}), a flexible framework that integrates HER with AlphaZero, allowing
easy adjustments to HER properties such as relabeled goals, policy targets, and
trajectory selection. Our experiments, including equation discovery, show that
the possibility of modifying HER is beneficial and surpasses the performance of
pure supervised or reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: POEMS is an unsupervised probabilistic framework for multiomics integration that maintains predictive performance while providing interpretability through sparse connections, shared latent space, and adaptive gating networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the tradeoff between predictive performance and interpretability in deep generative models for multiomics data integration, where current models either sacrifice interpretability for performance or weaken nonlinear expressiveness through linearization.

Method: Uses Product of Experts model with sparse decoding: 1) sparse connections mapping features to latent factors for biomarker discovery, 2) shared latent space for cross-omic associations, 3) gating network to compute each omic's contribution, and 4) efficient sparse decoder.

Result: In cancer subtyping case study, achieves competitive clustering and classification performance while providing novel interpretations, demonstrating that biomarker insight and predictive accuracy can coexist.

Conclusion: POEMS successfully bridges the gap between interpretability and performance in multiomics representation learning without compromising nonlinear expressiveness through its sparse decoding approach.

Abstract: Integrating different molecular layers, i.e., multiomics data, is crucial for
unraveling the complexity of diseases; yet, most deep generative models either
prioritize predictive performance at the expense of interpretability or enforce
interpretability by linearizing the decoder, thereby weakening the network's
nonlinear expressiveness. To overcome this tradeoff, we introduce POEMS:
Product Of Experts for Interpretable Multiomics Integration using Sparse
Decoding, an unsupervised probabilistic framework that preserves predictive
performance while providing interpretability. POEMS provides interpretability
without linearizing any part of the network by 1) mapping features to latent
factors using sparse connections, which directly translates to biomarker
discovery, 2) allowing for cross-omic associations through a shared latent
space using product of experts model, and 3) reporting contributions of each
omic by a gating network that adaptively computes their influence in the
representation learning. Additionally, we present an efficient sparse decoder.
In a cancer subtyping case study, POEMS achieves competitive clustering and
classification performance while offering our novel set of interpretations,
demonstrating that biomarker based insight and predictive accuracy can coexist
in multiomics representation learning.

TL;DR: This paper develops a symmetry-aware kernel-based RL framework that exploits environmental symmetries to improve learning efficiency, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world RL environments have inherent symmetries that can be exploited to improve learning efficiency, but existing methods don't systematically incorporate these structural priors.

Method: Proposed a symmetry-aware variant of optimistic least-squares value iteration (LSVI) using invariant kernels to encode invariance in both rewards and transition dynamics.

Result: Established new bounds on maximum information gain and covering numbers for invariant RKHSs, explicitly quantifying sample efficiency gains from symmetry. Empirical results on Frozen Lake and 2D placement design show significantly better performance than standard kernel methods.

Conclusion: Symmetry-aware RL provides substantial sample efficiency improvements, highlighting the value of structural priors in designing more efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.

Abstract: In many real-world reinforcement learning (RL) problems, the environment
exhibits inherent symmetries that can be exploited to improve learning
efficiency. This paper develops a theoretical and algorithmic framework for
incorporating known group symmetries into kernel-based RL. We propose a
symmetry-aware variant of optimistic least-squares value iteration (LSVI),
which leverages invariant kernels to encode invariance in both rewards and
transition dynamics. Our analysis establishes new bounds on the maximum
information gain and covering numbers for invariant RKHSs, explicitly
quantifying the sample efficiency gains from symmetry. Empirical results on a
customized Frozen Lake environment and a 2D placement design problem confirm
the theoretical improvements, demonstrating that symmetry-aware RL achieves
significantly better performance than their standard kernel counterparts. These
findings highlight the value of structural priors in designing more
sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.

TL;DR: Extended Expressive Neural Network (ENN) with DCT-based adaptive activation functions achieves SOTA accuracy with efficient pruning, removing up to 40% of coefficients without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance neural network efficiency, interpretability and pruning capabilities by leveraging DCT-based parameterization for structured and decorrelated representations.

Method: Multilayer perceptron with adaptive activation functions parameterized using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), enabling direct identification of redundant components and efficient pruning strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in classification and implicit neural representation tasks while maintaining low parameter count; up to 40% of activation coefficients can be safely pruned.

Conclusion: ENN framework successfully integrates signal processing concepts into neural network design, achieving balanced trade-off between expressiveness, compactness, and interpretability.

Abstract: In this paper, we extend our previous work on the Expressive Neural Network
(ENN), a multilayer perceptron with adaptive activation functions parametrized
using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Building upon previous work that
demonstrated the strong expressiveness of ENNs with compact architectures, we
now emphasize their efficiency, interpretability and pruning capabilities. The
DCT-based parameterization provides a structured and decorrelated
representation that reveals the functional role of each neuron and allows
direct identification of redundant components. Leveraging this property, we
propose an efficient pruning strategy that removes unnecessary DCT coefficients
with negligible or no loss in performance. Experimental results across
classification and implicit neural representation tasks confirm that ENNs
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining a low number of parameters.
Furthermore, up to 40% of the activation coefficients can be safely pruned,
thanks to the orthogonality and bounded nature of the DCT basis. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that the ENN framework offers a principled integration of
signal processing concepts into neural network design, achieving a balanced
trade-off between expressiveness, compactness, and interpretability.

Motivation: To provide a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in imitation learning, given the significant expansion of capabilities through deep learning and emergence of new methodologies.

Result: A comprehensive survey highlighting recent trends, methodological innovations, practical applications, and evaluation practices in imitation learning research.

Conclusion: Identifies key challenges and outlines open directions for future research in imitation learning, providing a framework for understanding the current research landscape.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables agents to acquire skills by observing and
replicating the behavior of one or multiple experts. In recent years, advances
in deep learning have significantly expanded the capabilities and scalability
of imitation learning across a range of domains, where expert data can range
from full state-action trajectories to partial observations or unlabeled
sequences. Alongside this growth, novel approaches have emerged, with new
methodologies being developed to address longstanding challenges such as
generalization, covariate shift, and demonstration quality. In this survey, we
review the latest advances in imitation learning research, highlighting recent
trends, methodological innovations, and practical applications. We propose a
novel taxonomy that is distinct from existing categorizations to better reflect
the current state of the IL research stratum and its trends. Throughout the
survey, we critically examine the strengths, limitations, and evaluation
practices of representative works, and we outline key challenges and open

TL;DR: NAP is an attention-based model that aggregates predictions from multiple single-channel models using tri-axial attention to handle heterogeneous polysomnography data with varying modalities and channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polysomnography signals are heterogeneous across datasets with varying modalities and channels, but existing models use fixed subsets and fail to fully exploit multimodal nature.

Method: Introduces NAP with tri-axial attention mechanism that captures temporal, spatial, and predictor-level dependencies by aggregating outputs from frozen pretrained single-channel models.

Result: NAP consistently outperforms individual predictors and simple ensembles, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively handles heterogeneous polysomnography data and could be extended to other multimodal physiological applications beyond sleep staging.

Abstract: Polysomnography signals are highly heterogeneous, varying in modality
composition (e.g., EEG, EOG, ECG), channel availability (e.g., frontal,
occipital EEG), and acquisition protocols across datasets and clinical sites.
Most existing models that process polysomnography data rely on a fixed subset
of modalities or channels and therefore neglect to fully exploit its inherently
multimodal nature. We address this limitation by introducing NAP (Neural
Aggregator of Predictions), an attention-based model which learns to combine
multiple prediction streams using a tri-axial attention mechanism that captures
temporal, spatial, and predictor-level dependencies. NAP is trained to adapt to
different input dimensions. By aggregating outputs from frozen, pretrained
single-channel models, NAP consistently outperforms individual predictors and
simple ensembles, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across
multiple datasets. While demonstrated in the context of automated sleep staging
from polysomnography, the proposed approach could be extended to other
multimodal physiological applications.

*Mainak Singha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CPL trains neural networks to solve PDEs by projecting updates onto physical constraint sets (conservation, entropy, etc.), ensuring all solutions remain physically admissible with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks solving PDEs often violate physical laws like conservation, entropy, and shock conditions, creating unphysical solutions that break the very principles they should model.

Method: Constraint-Projected Learning (CPL) projects network outputs onto constraint sets for conservation, Rankine-Hugoniot balance, entropy, and positivity. Uses differentiable projection, total-variation damping, and rollout curriculum for stability.

Result: CPL eliminates physical violations: conservation holds at machine precision, total-variation growth vanishes, entropy and error remain bounded. Produces stable, physically lawful solutions for Burgers and Euler systems without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Instead of hoping neural solvers respect physics, CPL makes physical admissibility an intrinsic property of the learning process through constraint projection during training.

Abstract: Neural networks can approximate solutions to partial differential equations,
but they often break the very laws they are meant to model-creating mass from
nowhere, drifting shocks, or violating conservation and entropy. We address
this by training within the laws of physics rather than beside them. Our
framework, called Constraint-Projected Learning (CPL), keeps every update
physically admissible by projecting network outputs onto the intersection of
constraint sets defined by conservation, Rankine-Hugoniot balance, entropy, and
positivity. The projection is differentiable and adds only about 10%
computational overhead, making it fully compatible with back-propagation. We
further stabilize training with total-variation damping (TVD) to suppress small
oscillations and a rollout curriculum that enforces consistency over long
prediction horizons. Together, these mechanisms eliminate both hard and soft
violations: conservation holds at machine precision, total-variation growth
vanishes, and entropy and error remain bounded. On Burgers and Euler systems,
CPL produces stable, physically lawful solutions without loss of accuracy.
Instead of hoping neural solvers will respect physics, CPL makes that behavior
an intrinsic property of the learning process.

*Elvis Dohmatob,Mohammad Pezeshki,Reyhane Askari-Hemmat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical framework explaining when using less data can outperform classical scaling laws, showing that carefully curated small datasets can achieve better generalization than full datasets under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the paradox in modern ML where classical scaling laws suggest "more is more" but recent methods like LIMO achieve superior performance with small curated datasets, challenging conventional wisdom.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework studying data curation strategies with imperfect oracles that select training examples based on difficulty and correctness. Derived exact scaling law curves for test error under label-agnostic and label-aware curation rules.

Result: Showed that under certain conditions, small curated datasets can outperform full datasets, with analytical conditions for phase transitions tied to data size and quality. Validated theoretical claims empirically on ImageNet, confirming predictions about when curation improves accuracy and mitigates model collapse.

Conclusion: Provides principled explanation for contradictory curation strategies in LLM mathematical reasoning, establishing theoretical conditions where "less is more" outperforms traditional scaling approaches.

Abstract: This paper introduces a theoretical framework to resolve a central paradox in
modern machine learning: When is it better to use less data? This question has
become critical as classical scaling laws suggesting ``more is more'' (Sun et
al., 2025) are challenged by methods like LIMO (``less is more'') and s1 (Ye et
al., 2025; Muenighoff et al., 2025), which achieve superior performance with
small, aggressively curated datasets. Here, we study data curation strategies
where an imperfect oracle selects the training examples according to their
difficulty and correctness. Our results provide exact scaling law curves for
test error under both label-agnostic and label-aware curation rules, revealing
when and why keeping only a subset of data can improve generalization. In
contrast to classical scaling laws, we show that under certain conditions,
small curated datasets can outperform full datasets, and we provide analytical
conditions for this by deriving precise phase transition curves tied to data
size and quality. We validate these theoretical claims with empirical results
on ImageNet, confirming our predictions about when curation improves accuracy
and can even mitigate model collapse. Furthermore, our framework provides a
principled explanation for the contradictory curation strategies recently
observed in LLM mathematical reasoning.

*Bryan L. M. de Oliveira,Felipe V. Frujeri,Marcos P. C. M. Queiroz,Luana G. B. Martins,Telma W. de L. Soares,Luckeciano C. Melo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO eliminates learned critics and uses group-relative trajectory comparisons instead, but systematic evaluation shows learned critics remain essential for long-horizon tasks, with critic-free methods only working well in short-horizon environments like CartPole.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether learned baselines are necessary in policy-gradient methods by systematically studying GRPO as a critic-free alternative to PPO.

Method: Systematic study of GRPO in classical RL environments with controlled ablations isolating baselines, discounting, and group sampling across discrete and continuous control tasks.

Result: Three key findings: 1) Learned critics essential for long-horizon tasks; 2) GRPO benefits from high discount factors except in HalfCheetah; 3) Smaller group sizes outperform larger ones.

Conclusion: Critic-free methods have limitations in classical control and are only viable alternatives to learned value functions under specific conditions, primarily short-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable
alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by eliminating the learned
critic and instead estimating advantages through group-relative comparisons of
trajectories. This simplification raises fundamental questions about the
necessity of learned baselines in policy-gradient methods. We present the first
systematic study of GRPO in classical single-task reinforcement learning
environments, spanning discrete and continuous control tasks. Through
controlled ablations isolating baselines, discounting, and group sampling, we
reveal three key findings: (1) learned critics remain essential for
long-horizon tasks: all critic-free baselines underperform PPO except in
short-horizon environments like CartPole where episodic returns can be
effective; (2) GRPO benefits from high discount factors (gamma = 0.99) except
in HalfCheetah, where lack of early termination favors moderate discounting
(gamma = 0.9); (3) smaller group sizes outperform larger ones, suggesting
limitations in batch-based grouping strategies that mix unrelated episodes.
These results reveal both the limitations of critic-free methods in classical
control and the specific conditions where they remain viable alternatives to
learned value functions.

### [130] [Structured Matrix Scaling for Multi-Class Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03685)
*Eugène Berta,David Holzmüller,Michael I. Jordan,Francis Bach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes improved parametric recalibration methods for classifiers that go beyond standard temperature scaling, addressing overfitting in multi-class calibration through structured regularization and efficient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard parametric recalibration methods like temperature scaling are limited in expressiveness, and more complex calibration models for multi-class classification face overfitting issues due to high parameter counts and limited calibration data.

Method: Developed expressive calibration methods using logistic regression framework with structured regularization, robust preprocessing, and efficient optimization to manage bias-variance tradeoff in multi-class calibration.

Result: The proposed methods achieve substantial gains over existing logistic-based calibration techniques and provide efficient open-source implementations as alternatives to temperature, vector, and matrix scaling.

Conclusion: Expressive parametric recalibration with proper regularization and optimization effectively addresses multi-class calibration challenges, offering improved performance over standard methods.

Abstract: Post-hoc recalibration methods are widely used to ensure that classifiers
provide faithful probability estimates. We argue that parametric recalibration
functions based on logistic regression can be motivated from a simple
theoretical setting for both binary and multiclass classification. This insight
motivates the use of more expressive calibration methods beyond standard
temperature scaling. For multi-class calibration however, a key challenge lies
in the increasing number of parameters introduced by more complex models, often
coupled with limited calibration data, which can lead to overfitting. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting bias-variance tradeoff
can be effectively managed by structured regularization, robust preprocessing
and efficient optimization. The resulting methods lead to substantial gains
over existing logistic-based calibration techniques. We provide efficient and
easy-to-use open-source implementations of our methods, making them an
attractive alternative to common temperature, vector, and matrix scaling
implementations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a Byzantine-robust federated learning method with adaptive aggregation weights that are jointly optimized with model parameters, outperforming existing approaches in heterogeneous data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces robustness challenges from malicious Byzantine clients, especially when client data distributions are heterogeneous, requiring improved aggregation methods.

Method: Novel optimization problem treating aggregation weights as learnable parameters, solved via alternating minimization algorithm with convergence guarantees under adversarial attacks.

Result: Method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust FL approaches across various datasets and attack scenarios, particularly with highly heterogeneous data and many malicious clients.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive weighting approach effectively enhances Byzantine resilience in federated learning, especially in challenging heterogeneous data environments.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model without sharing their private data. However, the presence of malicious
(Byzantine) clients poses significant challenges to the robustness of FL,
particularly when data distributions across clients are heterogeneous. In this
paper, we propose a novel Byzantine-robust FL optimization problem that
incorporates adaptive weighting into the aggregation process. Unlike
conventional approaches, our formulation treats aggregation weights as
learnable parameters, jointly optimizing them alongside the global model
parameters. To solve this optimization problem, we develop an alternating
minimization algorithm with strong convergence guarantees under adversarial
attack. We analyze the Byzantine resilience of the proposed objective. We
evaluate the performance of our algorithm against state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust FL approaches across various datasets and attack scenarios.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing approaches, particularly in settings with highly heterogeneous data
and a large proportion of malicious clients.

### [132] [AnaFlow: Agentic LLM-based Workflow for Reasoning-Driven Explainable and Sample-Efficient Analog Circuit Sizing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03697)
*Mohsen Ahmadzadeh,Kaichang Chen,Georges Gielen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel agentic AI framework called AnaFlow that uses LLM-based agents to automate analog circuit sizing with high sample efficiency and explainable reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analog circuit design is currently a manual, time-consuming process that requires many simulations and lacks explainability in AI-based automation tools.

Method: Multi-agent workflow with specialized LLM agents that interpret circuit topology, understand design goals, and iteratively refine parameters using adaptive simulation strategy.

Result: Successfully demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity, achieving fully automatic sizing with learning from optimization history to avoid past mistakes and accelerate convergence.

Conclusion: AnaFlow represents a new paradigm in analog EDA where AI agents serve as transparent design assistants for efficient design space exploration.

Abstract: Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the
physical world. Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process,
resulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of
AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to
automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical
bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of
explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of
the tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for
sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs
a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based
agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design
goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the
target goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation
strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency.
The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity
and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from
pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system
learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate
convergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog
design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents
serve as transparent design assistants.

### [133] [Flat Minima and Generalization: Insights from Stochastic Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03548)
*Matan Schliserman,Shira Vansover-Hager,Tomer Koren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper challenges the conventional wisdom that flat minima always generalize well, showing that in stochastic convex optimization, flat minima can have poor generalization while sharp minima can generalize optimally. It also demonstrates that sharpness-aware algorithms (SA-GD and SAM) may converge to solutions with poor generalization despite finding flat minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the relationship between flat minima and generalization performance in stochastic convex optimization, challenging the common belief that flat minima consistently lead to better generalization.

Method: Theoretical analysis of stochastic convex optimization with non-negative β-smooth objectives, examining flat vs sharp minima generalization properties and analyzing two sharpness-aware algorithms: SA-GD (Sharpness-Aware Gradient Descent) and SAM (Sharpness-Aware Minimization).

Result: Found that flat empirical minima can incur Ω(1) population risk while sharp minima generalize optimally. Both SA-GD and SAM algorithms can converge to solutions with poor generalization (Ω(1) population risk), even when SA-GD successfully finds flat minima.

Conclusion: Flat minima do not guarantee good generalization in stochastic convex optimization, and sharpness-aware algorithms designed to find flat minima may still yield poor generalization performance, challenging the prevailing view about flat minima's generalization benefits.

Abstract: Understanding the generalization behavior of learning algorithms is a central
goal of learning theory. A recently emerging explanation is that learning
algorithms are successful in practice because they converge to flat minima,
which have been consistently associated with improved generalization
performance. In this work, we study the link between flat minima and
generalization in the canonical setting of stochastic convex optimization with
a non-negative, $\beta$-smooth objective. Our first finding is that, even in
this fundamental and well-studied setting, flat empirical minima may incur
trivial $\Omega(1)$ population risk while sharp minima generalizes optimally.
Then, we show that this poor generalization behavior extends to two natural
''sharpness-aware'' algorithms originally proposed by Foret et al. (2021),
designed to bias optimization toward flat solutions: Sharpness-Aware Gradient
Descent (SA-GD) and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). For SA-GD, which
performs gradient steps on the maximal loss in a predefined neighborhood, we
prove that while it successfully converges to a flat minimum at a fast rate,
the population risk of the solution can still be as large as $\Omega(1)$,
indicating that even flat minima found algorithmically using a sharpness-aware
gradient method might generalize poorly. For SAM, a computationally efficient
approximation of SA-GD based on normalized ascent steps, we show that although
it minimizes the empirical loss, it may converge to a sharp minimum and also
incur population risk $\Omega(1)$. Finally, we establish population risk upper
bounds for both SA-GD and SAM using algorithmic stability techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabGemma is a schema-agnostic LLM for tabular prediction that addresses numeric tokenization instability and context limitations through scientific notation canonicalization and compact retrieval, achieving SOTA on semantic classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt pretrained LLMs for tabular prediction with mixed data types, overcoming challenges of unstable numeric tokenization and limited context size when dealing with tabular data.

Method: Canonicalize numbers using signed scientific notation, continue pretraining Gemma 3 model with target imputation objective, and use n-gram-based retrieval for informative exemplars within 128k-token context window.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on classification across low/high-data regimes with monotonic improvement from more context rows; competitive regression at small samples but trails conventional methods with more data.

Conclusion: LLMs can be effective tabular in-context learners for semantic tasks when equipped with proper numeric handling and context retrieval, but need further advances in numeric modeling and long-context scaling.

Abstract: We study LLMs for tabular prediction with mixed text, numeric, and
categorical fields. We introduce TabGemma, a schema-agnostic in-context learner
that treats rows as sequences and tackles two practical hurdles when adapting
pretrained LLMs for tabular predictions: unstable numeric tokenization and
limited context size. We propose to canonicalize numbers via signed scientific
notation and continue pretraining of a 12B Gemma 3 model with a target
imputation objective using a large-scale real world dataset. For inference, we
use a compact n-gram-based retrieval to select informative exemplars that fit
within a 128k-token window.
  On semantically rich benchmarks, TabGemma establishes a new state of the art
on classification across low- and high-data regimes and improves monotonically
with more context rows. For regression, it is competitive at small sample sizes
but trails conventional approaches as data grows. Our results show that LLMs
can be effective tabular in-context learners on highly semantic tasks when
paired with dedicated numeric handling and context retrieval, while motivating
further advances in numeric modeling and long-context scaling.

*Junyi Wu,Dan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TEQL is a tensor-based Q-learning method that uses improved low-rank decomposition with novel exploration strategies and regularization to address high-dimensional RL challenges, outperforming traditional methods in sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional reinforcement learning suffers from computational complexity and poor sample efficiency due to the curse of dimensionality, where state-action spaces grow exponentially with problem size.

Method: Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL) enhances low-rank tensor decomposition via improved block coordinate descent on discretized state-action spaces, incorporating exploration strategies that combine approximation error with visit count-based upper confidence bound, plus frequency-based regularization.

Result: Empirical results on classic control tasks show TEQL outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and deep RL approaches in both sample efficiency and total rewards.

Conclusion: TEQL is particularly suitable for resource-constrained applications like space and healthcare where sampling costs are high, due to its superior sample efficiency and performance.

Abstract: High-dimensional reinforcement learning faces challenges with complex
calculations and low sample efficiency in large state-action spaces. Q-learning
algorithms struggle particularly with the curse of dimensionality, where the
number of state-action pairs grows exponentially with problem size. While
neural network-based approaches like Deep Q-Networks have shown success, recent
tensor-based methods using low-rank decomposition offer more
parameter-efficient alternatives. Building upon existing tensor-based methods,
we propose Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL), which enhances low-rank tensor
decomposition via improved block coordinate descent on discretized state-action
spaces, incorporating novel exploration and regularization mechanisms. The key
innovation is an exploration strategy that combines approximation error with
visit count-based upper confidence bound to prioritize actions with high
uncertainty, avoiding wasteful random exploration. Additionally, we incorporate
a frequency-based penalty term in the objective function to encourage
exploration of less-visited state-action pairs and reduce overfitting to
frequently visited regions. Empirical results on classic control tasks
demonstrate that TEQL outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and deep RL
approaches in both sample efficiency and total rewards, making it suitable for
resource-constrained applications, such as space and healthcare where sampling
costs are high.

### [136] [Going Beyond Expert Performance via Deep Implicit Imitation Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03616)
*Iason Chrysomallis,Georgios Chalkiadakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep Implicit Imitation Q-Network (DIIQN) combines deep RL with implicit imitation learning from observation-only datasets, enabling agents to leverage suboptimal expert demonstrations and surpass expert performance through adaptive confidence mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional imitation learning requires complete state-action demonstrations from optimal experts, which limits practical applicability since real-world scenarios often provide only state observations and expert performance is frequently suboptimal.

Method: DIIQN uses action inference to reconstruct expert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence mechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning. HA-DIIQN extension handles heterogeneous action sets with infeasibility detection and bridging procedures.

Result: DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns than standard DQN and outperforms existing implicit imitation methods. HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines in heterogeneous action settings.

Conclusion: The framework enables practical imitation learning from observation-only datasets with suboptimal experts, while maintaining capacity to exceed expert performance and handling heterogeneous action scenarios previously unaddressed.

Abstract: Imitation learning traditionally requires complete state-action
demonstrations from optimal or near-optimal experts. These requirements
severely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide
only state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is
often suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation
reinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining
deep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from
observation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation
Q-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs
expert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence
mechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning.
This enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training
while maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further
extend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to
tackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a
challenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature.
HA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging
procedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to
expert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental
results demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns
compared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit
imitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance. In heterogeneous
action settings, HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines, leveraging
expert datasets unusable by conventional approaches. Extensive parameter
sensitivity analysis reveals the framework's robustness across varying dataset
sizes and hyperparameter configurations.

Conclusion: This work represents an important step towards fully formalizing convergent RL results, with the framework being extensible to convergence rates and other convergence modes.

Abstract: In this paper, we formalize the almost sure convergence of $Q$-learning and

attention nowadays. This paper formally verifies their almost sure convergence
in a unified framework based on the Robbins-Siegmund theorem. The framework
developed in this work can be easily extended to convergence rates and other
modes of convergence. This work thus makes an important step towards fully
formalizing convergent RL results. The code is available at

Conclusion: nanoTabPFN successfully democratizes tabular foundation models by making them computationally accessible and easier to understand for educational and research purposes.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN have revolutionized predictive
machine learning for tabular data. At the same time, the driving factors of
this revolution are hard to understand. Existing open-source tabular foundation
models are implemented in complicated pipelines boasting over 10,000 lines of

to adapt for new experiments. We introduce nanoTabPFN, a simplified and
lightweight implementation of the TabPFN v2 architecture and a corresponding
training loop that uses pre-generated training data. nanoTabPFN makes tabular
foundation models more accessible to students and researchers alike. For
example, restricted to a small data setting it achieves a performance
comparable to traditional machine learning baselines within one minute of
pre-training on a single GPU (160,000x faster than TabPFN v2 pretraining). This

Conclusion: The framework enhances IoT healthcare security through effective anomaly detection, enabling early detection of cyber threats and device failures to prevent data breaches, minimize downtime, and ensure safe operation of medical devices, ultimately safeguarding patient health and trust.

Abstract: The integration of IoT devices in healthcare introduces significant security
and reliability challenges, increasing susceptibility to cyber threats and
operational anomalies. This study proposes a machine learning-driven framework
for (1) detecting malicious cyberattacks and (2) identifying faulty device
anomalies, leveraging a dataset of 200,000 records. Eight machine learning
models are evaluated across three learning approaches: supervised learning
(XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (K- NN)), semi-supervised learning (Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAE)), and unsupervised
learning (One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), Isolation Forest, Graph
Neural Networks (GNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoders). The
comprehensive evaluation was conducted across multiple metrics like F1-score,
precision, recall, accuracy, ROC-AUC, computational efficiency. XGBoost
achieved 99\% accuracy with minimal computational overhead (0.04s) for anomaly
detection, while Isolation Forest balanced precision and recall effectively.
LSTM Autoencoders underperformed with lower accuracy and higher latency. For
attack detection, KNN achieved near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-score
with the lowest computational cost (0.05s), followed by VAE at 97% accuracy.
GAN showed the highest computational cost with lowest accuracy and ROC-AUC.
These findings enhance IoT-enabled healthcare security through effective
anomaly detection strategies. By improving early detection of cyber threats and
device failures, this framework has the potential to prevent data breaches,
minimize system downtime, and ensure the continuous and safe operation of
medical devices, ultimately safeguarding patient health and trust in IoT-driven

TL;DR: BAQ enables smooth offline-to-online RL transition by using an implicit behavioral model from offline data to provide behavior-consistency signals during online fine-tuning, adapting constraints based on uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL policies struggle when deployed in dynamic environments due to distributional shift and unreliable value estimates on unseen state-action pairs.

Method: Behavior-Adaptive Q-Learning (BAQ) uses a dual-objective loss that aligns online policy toward offline behavior when uncertainty is high, and gradually relaxes this constraint as confident online experience accumulates.

Result: BAQ consistently outperforms prior offline-to-online RL approaches across standard benchmarks, achieving faster recovery, improved robustness, and higher overall performance.

Conclusion: Implicit behavior adaptation is a principled and practical solution for reliable real-world policy deployment in offline-to-online RL transitions.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables training from fixed data without
online interaction, but policies learned offline often struggle when deployed
in dynamic environments due to distributional shift and unreliable value
estimates on unseen state-action pairs. We introduce Behavior-Adaptive
Q-Learning (BAQ), a framework designed to enable a smooth and reliable
transition from offline to online RL. The key idea is to leverage an implicit
behavioral model derived from offline data to provide a behavior-consistency
signal during online fine-tuning. BAQ incorporates a dual-objective loss that
(i) aligns the online policy toward the offline behavior when uncertainty is
high, and (ii) gradually relaxes this constraint as more confident online
experience is accumulated. This adaptive mechanism reduces error propagation
from out-of-distribution estimates, stabilizes early online updates, and
accelerates adaptation to new scenarios. Across standard benchmarks, BAQ
consistently outperforms prior offline-to-online RL approaches, achieving
faster recovery, improved robustness, and higher overall performance. Our
results demonstrate that implicit behavior adaptation is a principled and
practical solution for reliable real-world policy deployment.

*Guanning Zeng,Zhaoyi Zhou,Daman Arora,Andrea Zanette*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes shrinkage estimators for reward baselines in RLVR to reduce policy-gradient variance by combining per-prompt and across-prompt means, improving training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard per-prompt empirical mean baselines in RLVR can be suboptimal, especially in low-generation regimes. Inspired by Stein's paradox, better mean estimation can reduce policy-gradient variance.

Method: Uses shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt means to create improved baselines, serving as drop-in replacements without additional hyperparameters.

Result: Theoretically proves lower-variance policy-gradient estimators. Empirically shows consistent outperformance over standard baselines with reduced gradient variance and improved stability.

Conclusion: Shrinkage baselines provide a simple yet effective improvement for RLVR training, offering better variance reduction and stability without computational overhead.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using
policy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods
typically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each
prompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline),
reducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator.
  Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages
for each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we
propose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt
means to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy --
particularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we
construct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance
policy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a
drop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no
additional hyper-parameters or computation. Empirically, shrinkage baselines
consistently outperform standard empirical-mean baselines, leading to
lower-variance gradient updates and improved training stability.

### [143] [List Decoding and New Bicycle Code Constructions for Quantum LDPC Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02951)
*Sheida Rabeti,Hessam Mahdavifar*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes MBBP-LD decoder for QLDPC codes that extends classical MBBP framework, maintains linear-time complexity while improving logical error rate, and introduces new decision rule for post-processing list decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve decoding performance for quantum LDPC codes while preserving the linear-time complexity advantage of standard BP decoders, addressing the need for more efficient quantum error correction.

Method: Extends Multiple-Bases Belief-Propagation framework to quantum codes, introduces new decision rule for post-processing list decoder, and explores univariate bicycle codes with lower-weight parity checks.

Result: Achieves up to 40% lower logical error rate compared to state-of-the-art BP-OSD decoder for [[144,12,12]] bivariate bicycle code while maintaining linear-time complexity. UB codes show promising performance with reduced search space.

Conclusion: MBBP-LD decoder provides significant performance improvement for QLDPC codes without sacrificing computational efficiency, and UB codes offer a practical subclass with reduced design complexity.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new decoder, called the Multiple-Bases
Belief-Propagation List Decoder (MBBP-LD), for Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check
(QLDPC) codes. It extends the Multiple-Bases Belief-Propagation (MBBP)
framework, originally developed for classical cyclic LDPC codes. The proposed
method preserves the linear-time complexity of standard BP decoder while
improving the logical error rate. To further reduce the logical error rate, a
new decision rule is introduced for the post-processing list decoder,
outperforming the conventional least-metric selector (LMS) criterion. For the
recently developed and implemented bivariate bicycle (BB) code with parameters
\([[144,12,12]]\), our proposed MBBP-LD decoder achieves up to 40\% lower
logical error rate compared to the state-of-the-art decoder for short QLDPC
codes, i.e., BP with ordered-statistics decoding (BP-OSD), while retaining the
linear-time complexity of the plain BP decoder. In addition, we explore a new
subclass of BB codes, that we refer to as the univariate bicycle (UB) codes,
specifically with lower-weight parity checks (\(w=6,8\)). This reduces the
polynomial search space for the code compared to general BB codes, i.e., by
reducing the search space over two polynomial components in BB codes to just a
single polynomial component in UB codes. Simulations demonstrate the promising
performance of these codes under various types of BP decoders.

### [144] [A Tsallis-Entropy Lens on Genetic Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03063)
*Margarita Geleta,Daniel Mas Montserrat,Alexander G. Ioannidis*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces F_q, a Tsallis-order q F-statistic that generalizes F_ST by measuring entropy loss in subpopulations, with q=2 recovering classical F_ST and q=1 corresponding to Shannon entropy. It provides fine-grained differentiation analysis across allele frequency spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more nuanced measure of population differentiation that can capture both rare and common variants through a tunable parameter q, overcoming limitations of classical F_ST when allele-frequency spectra are skewed.

Method: Define F_q as the fraction of Tsallis q-entropy lost within subpopulations relative to the pooled population. Apply in One-vs-Rest and Leave-One-Out modes to real Oceanian genomic data (865 genomes, 1.8M sites) and controlled genealogical simulations (1,432 founders, 322K sites).

Result: F_q successfully attributes which subpopulations drive regional structure, sensitively timestamps isolation-migration events and founder effects, and provides finer-resolution analysis than F_ST, especially when allele-frequency spectra are skewed.

Conclusion: F_q serves as a finer-resolution complement to F_ST for simulation audits and population-structure summaries, offering tunable sensitivity across the allele frequency spectrum through parameter q.

Abstract: We introduce an information-theoretic generalization of the fixation
statistic, the Tsallis-order $q$ F-statistic, $F_q$, which measures the
fraction of Tsallis $q$-entropy lost within subpopulations relative to the
pooled population. The family nests the classical variance-based fixation index
$F_{\textbf{ST}}$ at $q{=}2$ and a Shannon-entropy analogue at $q{=}1$, whose
absolute form equals the mutual information between alleles and population
labels. By varying $q$, $F_q$ acts as a spectral differentiator that up-weights
rare variants at low $q$, while $q{>}1$ increasingly emphasizes common
variants, providing a more fine-grained view of differentiation than
$F_{\textbf{ST}}$ when allele-frequency spectra are skewed. On real data (865
Oceanian genomes with 1,823,000 sites) and controlled genealogical simulations
(seeded from 1,432 founders from HGDP and 1000 Genomes panels, with 322,216
sites), we show that $F_q$ in One-vs-Rest (OVR) and Leave-One-Out (LOO) modes
provides clear attribution of which subpopulations drive regional structure,
and sensitively timestamps isolation-migration events and founder effects.
$F_q$ serves as finer-resolution complement for simulation audits and
population-structure summaries.

### [145] [DRL-Based Robust Multi-Timescale Anti-Jamming Approaches under State Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03305)
*Haoqin Zhao,Zan Li,Jiangbo Si,Rui Huang,Hang Hu,Tony Q. S. Quek,Naofal Al-Dhahir*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes two robust anti-jamming algorithms (PGD-DDQN and NQC-DDQN) that maintain performance under bounded sensing errors in wireless communication systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anti-jamming methods assume perfect sensing and overlook practical issues like mismatched execution latencies and sensor measurement errors, which can mislead DRL agents into suboptimal actions with severe consequences.

Method: Established multi-timescale decision model with state uncertainty, then proposed two schemes: 1) PGD-DDQN that derives worst-case perturbations under norm-bounded error model and applies projected gradient descent during training; 2) NQC-DDQN that introduces nonlinear compression mechanism to adaptively contract Q-value ranges and eliminate action aliasing.

Result: Simulation results show only minor performance degradation compared to perfect-sensing baseline while maintaining robustness under various perturbations.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms validate practicality in imperfect sensing conditions and ensure reliable wireless transmission despite sensing errors.

Abstract: Owing to the openness of wireless channels, wireless communication systems
are highly susceptible to malicious jamming. Most existing anti-jamming methods
rely on the assumption of accurate sensing and optimize parameters on a single
timescale. However, such methods overlook two practical issues: mismatched
execution latencies across heterogeneous actions and measurement errors caused
by sensor imperfections. Especially for deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
methods, the inherent sensitivity of neural networks implies that even minor
perturbations in the input can mislead the agent into choosing suboptimal
actions, with potentially severe consequences. To ensure reliable wireless
transmission, we establish a multi-timescale decision model that incorporates
state uncertainty. Subsequently, we propose two robust schemes that sustain
performance under bounded sensing errors. First, a Projected Gradient
Descent-assisted Double Deep Q-Network (PGD-DDQN) algorithm is designed, which
derives worst-case perturbations under a norm-bounded error model and applies
PGD during training for robust optimization. Second, a Nonlinear Q-Compression
DDQN (NQC-DDQN) algorithm introduces a nonlinear compression mechanism that
adaptively contracts Q-value ranges to eliminate action aliasing. Simulation
results indicate that, compared with the perfect-sensing baseline, the proposed
algorithms show only minor degradation in anti-jamming performance while
maintaining robustness under various perturbations, thereby validating their
practicality in imperfect sensing conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop constacyclic codes with strong parameters that include optimal, almost-optimal, or best-known codes across various lengths.

Method: Constructs infinite families of q-ary constacyclic codes over finite field F_q using mathematical techniques to ensure specified length, dimension, and minimum distance properties.

Result: Successfully created multiple infinite families of constacyclic codes with dimension approximately n/2 and minimum distance growing as cn/log_q n, containing codes with optimal/near-optimal parameters.

Conclusion: The constructed constacyclic codes provide valuable additions to coding theory with strong performance characteristics across various length forms.

Abstract: In this paper, we construct several infinite families of $q$-ary constacyclic
codes over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with length $n$, dimension around
$n/2$, and minimum distance at least $cn/\log_q n$ for some positive constant
$c$. They contain many constacyclic codes with optimal, or almost-optimal, or

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address open problems about non-Reed-Solomon MDS codes and extend previous work on (L,P)-TGRS codes by Hu et al.

Method: Analyzes (+)-(L,P)-TGRS codes by presenting parity-check matrices, proving necessary/sufficient conditions for NMDS properties, and constructing self-orthogonal codes.

Result: Solved two open problems from Hu et al., proved non-RS property for 2k>n, and constructed new classes of self-orthogonal codes.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of non-RS MDS codes and provides practical constructions that improve upon previous results.

Abstract: The construction of the non-Reed-Solomon (in short, non-RS) type linear code
has been one of the research hotspots in recent years. In 2025, Hu et al.
constructed some non-RS MDS codes by defining the (L, P)-twisted generalized
Reed-Solomon code (in short, (L, P)-TGRS). In this paper, we focus on the
(+)-(L, P)-TGRS code C. We firstly present a parity-check matrix. Secondly, we
give a sufficient and necessary condition for C to be NMDS which partially
answers two open problems proposed by Hu et al. in 2025, and prove that C is
non-RS for 2k > n which partially improves the corresponding result given by Hu
et al. in 2025,. Thirdly, we give a sufficient condition for C not to be
self-dual or self-orthogonal, respectively, furthermore, we construct two
classes of self-orthogonal codes which is a promotion of the corresponding
result given by Ding et al. in 2025. Finally, some examples are given.

### [148] [On the Fundamental Scaling Laws of Fluid Antenna Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03415)
*Xusheng Zhu,Farshad Rostami Ghadi,Tuo Wu,Kaitao Meng,Chao Wang,Gui Zhou*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper establishes fundamental scaling laws for symbol error rate (SER) in fluid antenna systems (FAS) under spatially correlated channels, providing closed-form asymptotic expressions and characterizing diversity/coding gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There has been a notable absence of rigorous analytical framework for error probability in fluid antenna systems, despite their promise for enhancing wireless communication through spatial diversity.

Method: The authors derive tight closed-form asymptotic expressions for SER applicable to general modulation schemes, establishing fundamental scaling laws that govern the relationship between SER and channel spatial correlation structure.

Result: The analysis provides complete characterization of diversity and coding gains, revealing that SER improvement depends fundamentally on expanding antenna movement space rather than just increasing port density in constrained spaces.

Conclusion: The key design directive is that SER can be fundamentally improved by expanding antenna movement space to increase diversity, while merely increasing port density within constrained space yields diminishing returns.

Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FAS) offer a promising paradigm for enhancing wireless
communication by exploiting spatial diversity, yet a rigorous analytical
framework for their error probability has been notably absent. To this end,
this paper addresses this critical gap by unveiling the \textbf{fundamental
scaling laws} that govern the symbol error rate (SER) of FAS in realistic,
spatially correlated channels. To establish these laws, we derive a tight,
closed-form asymptotic expression for the SER applicable to a general class of
modulation schemes. This result is pivotal as it establishes the fundamental
scaling law governing the relationship between SER and the channel's spatial
correlation structure. Based on this framework, we provide a complete
characterization of the diversity and coding gains. The analysis culminates in
a definitive design directive: SER can be fundamentally improved by expanding
the antenna's movement space to increase diversity, while merely increasing
port density within a constrained space yields diminishing returns.

### [149] [Neural Beamforming with Doppler-Aware Sparse Attention for High Mobility Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03632)
*Cemil Vahapoglu,Timothy J. O'Shea,Wan Liu,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF, a transformer-based beamforming model with channel-adaptive sparse attention that outperforms conventional methods in high mobility scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional beamforming techniques degrade under adverse channel conditions, and existing sparse attention mechanisms don't account for wireless channel dynamics, limiting performance in high mobility scenarios.

Method: Uses a channel-adaptive sparse attention mechanism configurable along time-frequency axes based on channel dynamics, with theoretical guarantees of full connectivity within p hops (number of attention heads) in a MU-SIMO setting.

Result: Significantly outperforms fixed-pattern sparse NNBF and conventional ZFBF/MMSE beamforming under urban macro channel conditions in high mobility scenarios, while maintaining structured sparsity.

Conclusion: The Doppler-aware sparse attention mechanism effectively addresses scalability limitations of transformers in large OFDM grids while improving beamforming performance in dynamic wireless environments.

Abstract: Beamforming has significance for enhancing spectral efficiency and mitigating
interference in multi-antenna wireless systems, facilitating spatial
multiplexing and diversity in dense and high mobility scenarios. Traditional
beamforming techniques such as zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) and minimum mean
square error (MMSE) beamforming experience performance deterioration under
adverse channel conditions. Deep learning-based beamforming offers an
alternative with nonlinear mappings from channel state information (CSI) to
beamforming weights by improving robustness against dynamic channel
environments. Transformer-based models are particularly effective due to their
ability to model long-range dependencies across time and frequency. However,
their quadratic attention complexity limits scalability in large OFDM grids.
Recent studies address this issue through sparse attention mechanisms that
reduce complexity while maintaining expressiveness, yet often employ patterns
that disregard channel dynamics, as they are not specifically designed for
wireless communication scenarios. In this work, we propose a Doppler-aware
Sparse Neural Network Beamforming (Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF) model that
incorporates a channel-adaptive sparse attention mechanism in a multi-user
single-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) setting. The proposed sparsity structure
is configurable along 2D time-frequency axes based on channel dynamics and is
theoretically proven to ensure full connectivity within p hops, where p is the
number of attention heads. Simulation results under urban macro (UMa) channel
conditions show that Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF significantly outperforms both a
fixed-pattern baseline, referred to as Standard Sparse NNBF, and conventional
beamforming techniques ZFBF and MMSE beamforming in high mobility scenarios,
while maintaining structured sparsity with a controlled number of attended keys
per query.

*Jon Kutasov,Chloe Loughridge,Yuqi Sun,Henry Sleight,Buck Shlegeris,Tyler Tracy,Joe Benton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of AI control protocols shows resampling and critical action deferral improve safety from 50% to 96%, but adaptive attacks can reduce resampling safety to 17%, while critical action deferral remains robust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems become more capable and widely deployed as agents, ensuring their safe operation becomes critical. AI control offers one approach to mitigating risk from untrusted AI agents by monitoring actions and intervening when necessary.

Method: Systematically evaluated control protocols in SHADE-Arena dataset of diverse agentic environments. Tested blue team protocols (deferral to trusted models, resampling, critical action deferral) against default attacks, then iterated red team strategies with additional affordances.

Result: Resampling for incrimination and deferring on critical actions performed best initially, increasing safety from 50% to 96%. However, adaptive attacks with knowledge of resampling or ability to simulate monitors reduced resampling safety to 17%. Critical action deferral remained highly robust even against strongest attacks.

Conclusion: Critical action deferral is highly robust to adaptive adversaries, demonstrating the importance of denying attack policies access to protocol internals for maintaining AI safety.

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable and widely deployed as agents, ensuring
their safe operation becomes critical. AI control offers one approach to
mitigating the risk from untrusted AI agents by monitoring their actions and
intervening or auditing when necessary. Evaluating the safety of these
protocols requires understanding both their effectiveness against current
attacks and their robustness to adaptive adversaries. In this work, we
systematically evaluate a range of control protocols in SHADE-Arena, a dataset
of diverse agentic environments. First, we evaluate blue team protocols,
including deferral to trusted models, resampling, and deferring on critical
actions, against a default attack policy. We find that resampling for
incrimination and deferring on critical actions perform best, increasing safety
from 50% to 96%. We then iterate on red team strategies against these protocols
and find that attack policies with additional affordances, such as knowledge of
when resampling occurs or the ability to simulate monitors, can substantially
improve attack success rates against our resampling strategy, decreasing safety
to 17%. However, deferring on critical actions is highly robust to even our
strongest red team strategies, demonstrating the importance of denying attack
policies access to protocol internals.

### [151] [PublicAgent: Multi-Agent Design Principles From an LLM-Based Open Data Analysis Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03023)
*Sina Montazeri,Yunhe Feng,Kewei Sha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PublicAgent is a multi-agent framework that decomposes data analysis workflows into specialized agents to overcome LLM limitations in complex analytical tasks, enabling non-experts to access open data repositories through natural language interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open data repositories are inaccessible to non-experts who lack expertise in dataset discovery, schema mapping, and statistical analysis. Current LLMs face limitations in end-to-end analytical workflows due to attention dilution, interference of specialized reasoning patterns, and undetected error propagation.

Method: PublicAgent decomposes analytical workflows into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis, and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent contexts and enables validation at each stage.

Result: Evaluation across five models and 50 queries showed: 97.5% agent win rates even for strongest models, universal agents (discovery, analysis) show consistent effectiveness (std dev 12.4%), while conditional agents (report, intent) vary by model (std dev 20.5%). Removing discovery or analysis agents causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing report or intent causes quality degradation.

Conclusion: Five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems were derived: specialization provides value independent of model strength, agents divide into universal and conditional categories, agents mitigate distinct failure modes, architectural benefits persist across task complexity, and wide variance in agent effectiveness requires model-aware architecture design.

Abstract: Open data repositories hold potential for evidence-based decision-making, yet
are inaccessible to non-experts lacking expertise in dataset discovery, schema
mapping, and statistical analysis. Large language models show promise for
individual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental
limitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning
patterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a
multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition
into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis,
and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent
contexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models
and 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.
First, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the
strongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model
scale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and
conditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent
effectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev
20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or
analysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing
report or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits
persist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%
discovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning
enhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96%
for analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide
when and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while
enabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.

Conclusion: ScalingEval establishes a reproducible benchmark and evaluation protocol for LLMs as judges with actionable guidance on scaling, reliability, and model family tradeoffs.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) as judges is increasingly critical
for building scalable and trustworthy evaluation pipelines. We present
ScalingEval, a large-scale benchmarking study that systematically compares 36

the best overall performance across categories; (iii) GPT-4o provides the most
favorable latency-accuracy-cost tradeoff; and (iv) GPT-OSS 20B leads among
open-source models. Category-level analysis shows strong consensus in
structured domains (Electronics, Sports) but persistent disagreement in
lifestyle categories (Clothing, Food). These results establish ScalingEval as a

*Drago Plecko,Patrik Okanovic,Torsten Hoefler,Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark to test whether LLMs internalize real-world probability distributions, finding they perform poorly and lack observational distribution knowledge, which limits their causal reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLMs' capabilities in capturing probabilistic knowledge about real-world distributions, distinguishing between factual knowledge and probabilistic knowledge, and testing the hypothesis that LLMs can serve as universal approximators of real-world distributions.

Method: Developed the first benchmark to directly test whether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world populations across domains like economics, health, education, and social behavior.

Result: LLMs perform poorly overall and do not seem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. They lack knowledge of observational distributions (Layer 1 of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy).

Conclusion: LLMs' poor performance on observational distributions implies limited interventional and counterfactual knowledge according to the Causal Hierarchy Theorem, challenging the notion of LLMs as universal distributional learners.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise for advancing various
scientific disciplines, and are increasingly used in real-world applications.
Despite their remarkable progress, further capabilities are expected in order
to achieve more general types of intelligence. A critical distinction in this
context is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or
false answers (e.g., "what is the capital of England?"), and probabilistic
knowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., "what
is the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?"). In this paper, our goal
is to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of
knowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that
LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they
internalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful
universal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,
classical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight
fundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,
challenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we
develop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating
whether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world
populations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social
behavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not
seem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the
context of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that
language models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer
1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional
(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also
limited.

TL;DR: SnapStream is a KV cache compression method that enables 4x improved on-chip memory usage with minimal accuracy degradation, deployed in production inference systems with static graphs and continuous batching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large LLMs with 100k+ context length require substantial on-chip memory for KV caches, but existing compression techniques like StreamingLLM and SnapKV are not widely adopted in industrial deployments due to framework constraints and unclear accuracy impacts.

Method: Developed SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be deployed at scale in frameworks with static graphs and continuous batching, tested on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1.

Result: Achieved 4x improved on-chip memory usage with minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and LiveCodeBench, demonstrated in 16-way tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens/second.

Conclusion: SnapStream successfully implements sparse KV attention techniques in production inference systems, overcoming previous deployment barriers while maintaining model accuracy.

Abstract: The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+
context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory
to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV
demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet,
these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using
frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static
graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it
difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention
algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such
techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well
understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this
paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be
deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way
tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators
running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real
production setting. SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage
and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and
LiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation
of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system
with static graphs and continuous batching.

*Katherine C. Kellogg,Bingyang Ye,Yifan Hu,Guergana K. Savova,Byron Wallace,Danielle S. Bitterman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes capability-based monitoring for LLMs in healthcare as an alternative to traditional task-based monitoring, focusing on shared model capabilities rather than individual downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML monitoring approaches are task-based and assume performance degradation from dataset drift, but LLMs are generalist systems not trained for specific tasks, requiring a new monitoring paradigm.

Method: Organizes monitoring around shared model capabilities (summarization, reasoning, translation, safety guardrails) rather than individual downstream tasks, enabling cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses and emergent behaviors.

Result: Provides a scalable framework for detecting systemic weaknesses, long-tail errors, and emergent behaviors that task-based monitoring may miss in healthcare LLM applications.

Conclusion: Capability-based monitoring offers a scalable foundation for safe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist AI models in healthcare.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
accompanied by scrutiny of their oversight. Existing monitoring approaches,
inherited from traditional machine learning (ML), are task-based and founded on
assumed performance degradation arising from dataset drift. In contrast, with
LLMs, inevitable model degradation due to changes in populations compared to
the training dataset cannot be assumed, because LLMs were not trained for any
specific task in any given population. We therefore propose a new organizing
principle guiding generalist LLM monitoring that is scalable and grounded in
how these models are developed and used in practice: capability-based
monitoring. Capability-based monitoring is motivated by the fact that LLMs are
generalist systems whose overlapping internal capabilities are reused across
numerous downstream tasks. Instead of evaluating each downstream task
independently, this approach organizes monitoring around shared model
capabilities, such as summarization, reasoning, translation, or safety
guardrails, in order to enable cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses,
long-tail errors, and emergent behaviors that task-based monitoring may miss.
We describe considerations for developers, organizational leaders, and
professional societies for implementing a capability-based monitoring approach.
Ultimately, capability-based monitoring will provide a scalable foundation for
safe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist
artificial intelligence models in healthcare.

*Azim Ospanov,Farzan Farnia,Roozbeh Yousefzadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis of miniF2F benchmark reveals significant discrepancies between formal and informal math statements, with corrected version (miniF2F-v2) improving theorem proving pipeline accuracy from 36% to 70%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate AI systems' performance in math Olympiad settings where models must read natural language problems, formalize them in Lean, and prove them, while identifying issues in benchmark quality.

Method: Thorough analysis of formal-informal statement discrepancies in miniF2F, correction of errors, and creation of miniF2F-v2 with verified statements and proofs.

Result: Original pipeline accuracy was 36% vs individual SoTA accuracies of 97% (autoformalization) and 69% (theorem proving). After corrections, accuracy improved to 70% on miniF2F-v2.

Conclusion: Higher quality benchmarks are crucial for evaluating formal reasoning progress and diagnosing autoformalization and theorem proving model failures. The corrected dataset enables better assessment of AI mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We perform a thorough analysis of the formal and informal statements in the
miniF2F benchmark from the perspective of an AI system that is tasked to
participate in a math Olympiad consisting of the problems in miniF2F. In such
setting, the model has to read and comprehend the problems in natural language,
formalize them in Lean language, then proceed with proving the problems, and it
will get credit for each problem if the formal proof corresponds to the
original informal statement presented to the model. Our evaluation results
reveal that the best accuracy of such pipeline can be about 36% using the SoTA
models in the literature, considerably lower than the individual SoTA
accuracies, 97% and 69% reported in the autoformalization and theorem proving
literature. Analyzing the failure modes, we trace back a considerable portion
of this drop to discrepancies between the formal and informal statements for
more than half of the problems in miniF2F. We proceed with correcting all the
errors, discrepancies and simplifications in formal and informal statements,
and present the miniF2F-v2 with fully verified formal and informal statements
and proofs. Evaluating the full theorem proving pipeline on miniF2F-v2 leads to
the best accuracy of 70%, a significant improvement from the 40% on the
original miniF2F, yet indicating considerable misalignment between the
autoformalization models and theorem provers. Our deep analysis suggests that a
higher quality benchmark can help the community better evaluate progress in the
field of formal reasoning and also better diagnose the failure and success
modes of autoformalization and theorem proving models. Our dataset is available
at https://github.com/roozbeh-yz/miniF2F_v2.

### [157] [Using Multi-modal Large Language Model to Boost Fireworks Algorithm's Ability in Settling Challenging Optimization Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03137)
*Shipeng Cen,Ying Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using multi-modal large language models (MLLM) to enhance the fireworks algorithm (FWA) for complex optimization problems, introducing the concept of Critical Part (CP) to extend FWA to high-dimensional tasks like TSP and EDA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization methods struggle with non-convex, high-dimensional, black-box problems due to low efficiency and inaccurate gradient information. The rapid advancement of LLMs' language understanding and code generation capabilities offers new opportunities for optimization algorithm design.

Method: The authors use FWA as the base optimizer and incorporate MLLM to assist in algorithm design. They introduce the Critical Part (CP) concept to extend FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks and leverage MLLM's multi-modal capabilities to better utilize optimization process information.

Result: Experimental results on traveling salesman problem (TSP) and electronic design automation (EDA) problems show that the proposed FWA variants achieve or surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on many problem instances.

Conclusion: The integration of multi-modal large language models with traditional optimization algorithms like FWA provides an effective approach for handling complex optimization challenges, demonstrating superior performance on high-dimensional problems.

Abstract: As optimization problems grow increasingly complex and diverse, advancements
in optimization techniques and paradigm innovations hold significant
importance. The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily
manifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and
other unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order
methods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient
information, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are
ill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the
rapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial
improvements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities.
Consequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language
models has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we
choose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel
approach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large
language model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical
Part(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further
utilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the
multi-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific
tasks: the \textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \textit{electronic
design automation problem} (EDA). The experimental results show that FWAs
generated under our new framework have achieved or surpassed SOTA results on
many problem instances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel safety response framework for LLMs that uses supervised fine-tuning for input-level risk classification and RAG with fine-tuned interpretation for output-level safety, achieving 99.3% risk recall and perfect safety scores on high-risk tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security issues in LLMs are limiting their trustworthy deployment in critical domains, requiring systematic safety measures at both input and output levels.

Method: Input-level: supervised fine-tuning safety classification with 4-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused Attention). Output-level: RAG integration with fine-tuned interpretation model for grounded responses.

Result: 99.3% risk recall rate, significantly higher safety scores than baseline model, and perfect 100% safety score on proprietary high-risk test set.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective engineering pathway for building high-security, high-trust LLM applications with systematic input-output protection.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
associated security issues have become increasingly prominent, severely
constraining their trustworthy deployment in critical domains. This paper
proposes a novel safety response framework designed to systematically safeguard
LLMs at both the input and output levels. At the input level, the framework
employs a supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification model. Through a
fine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused
Attention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling
of user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario
adaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%. At the output level,
the framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a
specifically fine-tuned interpretation model, ensuring all responses are
grounded in a real-time, trustworthy knowledge base. This approach eliminates
information fabrication and enables result traceability. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed safety control model achieves a significantly
higher safety score on public safety evaluation benchmarks compared to the
baseline model, TinyR1-Safety-8B. Furthermore, on our proprietary high-risk
test set, the framework's components attained a perfect 100% safety score,
validating their exceptional protective capabilities in complex risk scenarios.
This research provides an effective engineering pathway for building
high-security, high-trust LLM applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel validation methodology for formal XAI explainers and finds that PyXAI produces incorrect explanations on most tested datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formal XAI provides theoretical guarantees but lacks practical validation methods for implementation correctness.

Method: Developed a novel validation methodology and tested it on the publicly available PyXAI formal explainer across multiple datasets.

Result: PyXAI was found to compute incorrect explanations on most datasets analyzed in the experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed validation methodology is crucial for ensuring the reliability of formal explainers in practice.

Abstract: Formal explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) offers unique theoretical
guarantees of rigor when compared to other non-formal methods of
explainability. However, little attention has been given to the validation of
practical implementations of formal explainers. This paper develops a novel
methodology for validating formal explainers and reports on the assessment of
the publicly available formal explainer PyXAI. The paper documents the
existence of incorrect explanations computed by PyXAI on most of the datasets
analyzed in the experiments, thereby confirming the importance of the proposed
novel methodology for the validation of formal explainers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent AI framework for engineering design that uses specialized agents to collaboratively generate and refine designs through structured design-review loops, demonstrated with NACA airfoil optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional engineering design processes are resource-intensive and inefficient due to the need for multi-domain expertise and complex collaborations.

Method: Three AI agents (Graph Ontologist, Design Engineer, Systems Engineer) collaborate using domain-specific knowledge graphs and computational tools in iterative feedback loops to generate and refine designs.

Result: Successfully applied to aerodynamic optimization of NACA airfoils, producing designs that meet technical requirements and can be optimized for performance metrics like lift-to-drag ratio.

Conclusion: Collaborative AI agents with structured knowledge representations can enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in engineering design processes.

Abstract: The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains,
leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional
methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this,
we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework
that integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces
specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine
design candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the
aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of
three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems
Engineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to
construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature.
The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical
requirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer
leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose
candidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and
provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge
graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the
manager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics
such as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how
collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can
enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.

*Yi-Fei Liu,Yi-Long Lu,Di He,Hang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can accurately model human psychological trait correlations from minimal Big Five personality data, using a two-stage reasoning process that approaches machine learning algorithm performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can capture the correlational structure of human psychological traits from minimal quantitative inputs, and understand their reasoning process.

Method: Prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality Scale responses from 816 individuals to role-play responses on nine other psychological scales, analyzing reasoning traces and comparing with semantic similarity and machine learning baselines.

Result: LLMs achieved remarkable accuracy (R² > 0.89) in capturing human psychological structure, substantially exceeding semantic similarity predictions and approaching machine learning algorithm performance. They use a systematic two-stage process involving information compression and reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs can precisely predict individual psychological traits through abstraction and reasoning, offering both a powerful tool for psychological simulation and insights into their emergent reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Psychological constructs within individuals are widely believed to be
interconnected. We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs)
can model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from
minimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality
Scale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine
other psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing
human psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from
LLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 >
0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on
semantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms
trained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that
LLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five
responses into natural language personality summaries through information
selection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics.
Second, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these
summaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality
factors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item
importance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely
redundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to
original scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent,
second-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs
can precisely predict individual participants' psychological traits from
minimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a
powerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their
emergent reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: AAA is an AI-enhanced web accessibility auditing framework that operationalizes WCAG-EM through human-AI partnership, using graph-based sampling and multimodal LLM assistance to enable scalable auditing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web accessibility auditing practices are resource-intensive and unscalable, with WCAG-EM requiring significant human effort and lacking practical support for large-scale execution, leaving most websites non-compliant.

Method: AAA framework with two key innovations: GRASP (graph-based multimodal sampling for representative page coverage) and MaC (multimodal LLM copilot for cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance in high-effort tasks).

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, showing that small-scale language models can serve as capable experts when fine-tuned, with four novel datasets contributed for benchmarking.

Conclusion: The AAA framework enables scalable, end-to-end web accessibility auditing through human-AI partnership, empowering auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world impact on web accessibility.

Abstract: Ensuring web accessibility is crucial for advancing social welfare, justice,
and equality in digital spaces, yet the vast majority of website user
interfaces remain non-compliant, due in part to the resource-intensive and
unscalable nature of current auditing practices. While WCAG-EM offers a
structured methodology for site-wise conformance evaluation, it involves great
human efforts and lacks practical support for execution at scale. In this work,
we present an auditing framework, AAA, which operationalizes WCAG-EM through a
human-AI partnership model. AAA is anchored by two key innovations: GRASP, a
graph-based multimodal sampling method that ensures representative page
coverage via learned embeddings of visual, textual, and relational cues; and
MaC, a multimodal large language model-based copilot that supports auditors
through cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance in high-effort tasks.
Together, these components enable scalable, end-to-end web accessibility
auditing, empowering human auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world
impact. We further contribute four novel datasets designed for benchmarking
core stages of the audit pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods, providing insights that small-scale language
models can serve as capable experts when fine-tuned.

TL;DR: Solly is the first AI agent to achieve elite human performance in multi-player Liar's Poker, outperforming both human experts and large language models through deep reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of previous AI systems in poker-like games where multi-player dynamics are subdued, by tackling Liar's Poker which features extensive multi-player engagement.

Method: Self-play training using a model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm.

Result: Solly achieved elite human level performance with over 50% win rate in both heads-up and multi-player formats, outperformed LLMs, developed novel strategies, and was not easily exploitable by world-class players.

Conclusion: The approach successfully demonstrates AI mastery in complex multi-player games with extensive engagement, advancing beyond previous poker AI achievements.

Abstract: AI researchers have long focused on poker-like games as a testbed for
environments characterized by multi-player dynamics, imperfect information, and
reasoning under uncertainty. While recent breakthroughs have matched elite
human play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued:
most hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple
rounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to
achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized
by extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a
model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played
at an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and
equity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also
outperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning
abilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies,
randomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class
human players.
