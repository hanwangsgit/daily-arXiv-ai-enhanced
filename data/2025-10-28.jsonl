A crucial part of\nmulti-sensor fusion is track-to-track association. Previous works often suffer\nfrom high computational complexity or are based on heuristics. We propose an\nassociation algorithms based on stochastic optimization, which leverages a\nmultidimensional likelihood incorporating the number of tracks and their\nspatial distribution and furthermore computes several association hypotheses.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in Monte Carlo simulations and\na realistic collective perception scenario computing high-likelihood\nassociations in ambiguous settings."}
