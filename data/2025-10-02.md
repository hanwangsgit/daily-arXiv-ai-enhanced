### [1] [Hybrid Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00033)
*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSUF module enhances hyperspectral image super-resolution by combining spectral unmixing with spatial-spectral feature extraction, using a custom gradient loss for improved reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral SISR is challenging due to difficulty in restoring spatial details while preserving spectral fidelity across wavelengths, limiting conventional deep learning models.

Method: Proposed Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF) module integrated into 2D CNNs, combining spectral unmixing with spectral-spatial feature extraction, and a custom Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function.

Result: Experiments on three public remote sensing hyperspectral datasets show competitive performance while reducing model complexity.

Conclusion: The hybrid deep learning model with SSUF module effectively improves both spatial resolution and spectral integrity in hyperspectral image super-resolution.

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [2] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified framework to characterize hallucinations in large language and vision models, linking them to specific mechanisms in the model lifecycle to address underlying causes rather than surface symptoms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in AI models can propagate misinformation and cause financial/operational harm. Current understanding is fragmented, leading to solutions that only address surface symptoms rather than root causes.

Method: Developed a unified multi-level framework for characterizing hallucinations across image and text modalities, using a task-modality interleaved approach to link hallucinations to specific mechanisms in model lifecycle.

Result: Investigations revealed that hallucinations often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited biases, providing insights into root causes.

Conclusion: The survey provides a foundation for developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world generative AI systems by addressing underlying mechanisms rather than surface symptoms.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

### [3] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Xianglong Liu,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobustVLA improves Vision-Language-Action model robustness against multi-modal perturbations in actions, instructions, environments, and observations through offline robust optimization and input consistency enforcement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models focus only on visual perturbations but overlook broader multi-modal disturbances across actions, instructions, environments, and observations, which are critical for real-world deployment.

Method: Proposed RobustVLA with two components: (1) output robustness via offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise, and (2) input robustness by enforcing consistent actions across input variations. Uses multi-armed bandit formulation with UCB algorithm to handle multiple perturbations.

Result: Achieves 12.6% gain on pi0 backbone and 10.4% on OpenVLA backbone across 17 perturbations, 50.6x faster inference than visual-robust VLAs, and 65.6% improvement on real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations.

Conclusion: RobustVLA effectively addresses multi-modal robustness in VLAs, demonstrating significant improvements across various perturbations and real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [4] [Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040)
*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADC is a capability-aware data curation framework that uses unsupervised capability discovery and influence estimation to create efficient instruction tuning curricula, achieving better performance than full-data training with only 5% of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction tuning methods treat models as black boxes and often cause regressions when reducing dataset size, overlooking the latent capabilities that govern learning.

Method: CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes training data to capabilities via influence estimation, and curates capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.

Result: With only 5% of the original data, CADC surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: Intrinsic capabilities are fundamental building blocks of model learning, and CADC establishes a principled paradigm for instruction data curation.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

### [5] [Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041)
*Yuchen Song,Andong Chen,Wenxin Zhu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C³B is a new benchmark for evaluating cultural awareness in MLLMs, featuring comics-based images with progressive difficulty across three tasks: visual recognition, cultural conflict understanding, and cultural content generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cultural awareness benchmarks lack progressive difficulty, cross-lingual tasks, and use real-world images that typically contain only one culture, making them too easy for MLLMs.

Method: Created C³B benchmark with over 2000 images and 18000 QA pairs across three progressively difficult tasks: basic visual recognition, cultural conflict understanding, and cultural content generation.

Result: Evaluation of 11 open-source MLLMs revealed significant performance gap compared to human performance, showing C³B poses substantial challenges for current models.

Conclusion: C³B demonstrates current MLLMs' limitations in cultural awareness and encourages future research to advance these capabilities.

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [6] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of gender bias in 6 text-to-image models reveals systematic occupational stereotypes where nurses are exclusively depicted as women and surgeons as men, with model-specific variations and prompt wording significantly influencing gender representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how state-of-the-art text-to-image models embed and amplify social biases in gender representation across different professions, particularly in healthcare settings.

Method: Generated 100 images for each combination of 5 hospital professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse, paramedic, surgeon) and 5 portrait qualifiers using 6 open-weight TTI models, then analyzed gender representation patterns.

Result: All models showed systematic stereotypes: nurses exclusively female, surgeons predominantly male. Model-specific differences: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforced rigid male dominance, FLUX.1-dev skewed female, others showed mixed outcomes. Portrait qualifiers like 'corporate' reinforced male depictions while 'beautiful' favored female ones.

Conclusion: Gender bias in TTI models is both systematic and model-specific, with prompt wording playing a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes, highlighting the need for bias-aware design and user guidance.

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [7] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer is a reinforcement learning framework that efficiently steals prompt templates from multimodal LLMs using only a few example images, reducing attack costs by 87% compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing prompt trading market creates security risks where valuable prompts can be stolen, exposing a vulnerability in MLLM workflows that needs to be addressed.

Method: Treats template stealing as sequential decision making using reinforcement learning with similarity-based reward functions to explore the prompt space effectively.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, reduces attack costs to under 13% of baselines, and generalizes well across different image styles to steal unseen templates.

Conclusion: Reveals urgent security threats in prompt trading and provides groundwork for developing protective standards in the MLLM marketplace.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

### [8] [Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047)
*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDCT is an automated method to test whether Vision-Language Models' explanations actually reflect what drives their predictions, by generating counterfactual image edits based on the explanations and checking if predictions change accordingly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often produce convincing but unfaithful explanations that don't reflect the true causal factors behind predictions, creating technical and governance risks.

Method: EDCT: (1) gets model's answer and explanation, (2) parses explanation into testable visual concepts, (3) generates counterfactual image edits via inpainting, (4) computes Counterfactual Consistency Score using LLM-assisted analysis of prediction changes.

Result: Across 120 OK-VQA examples and multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovered substantial faithfulness gaps and provided regulator-aligned audit artifacts showing when cited concepts fail causal tests.

Conclusion: EDCT provides automated verification of explanation faithfulness in VLMs, revealing when explanations don't reflect actual causal factors and creating audit trails for governance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [9] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiDe is a training-free framework that addresses poor MLLM performance on high-resolution images by decoupling key information from background interference through token-wise attention and layout-preserving techniques, achieving new SOTA results with 75% less memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs perform suboptimally on high-resolution images, with existing approaches incorrectly attributing this to object size limitations rather than the actual cause: complex background interference.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe) with two components: Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to identify key information tokens and align with target visual regions, and Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple regions from background while preserving spatial layouts.

Result: Sets new SOTA on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B to 92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench, surpassing RL methods while using 75% less memory than previous training-free approaches.

Conclusion: HiDe effectively addresses background interference in high-resolution images through hierarchical decoupling, achieving superior performance without training while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

### [10] [FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059)
*Jiahao Fu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSDENet is a dual-domain network that integrates spatial and frequency domain processing to enhance remote sensing image segmentation, particularly addressing edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address semantic edge ambiguities in remote sensing images caused by grayscale variations like shadows and low-contrast regions, and to fully leverage spatial information for better segmentation.

Method: Combines spatial processing for multi-scale features with frequency-domain analysis using FFT for global representations and Haar wavelet transform for feature decomposition into high/low-frequency components to refine boundary segmentation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets: LoveDA, Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID, with substantial improvement in segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition zones.

Conclusion: The dual-domain synergy between spatial granularity and frequency-domain edge sensitivity effectively enhances segmentation accuracy in challenging remote sensing scenarios.

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Max-V1 is a one-stage end-to-end autonomous driving framework that formulates trajectory planning as next waypoint prediction using Vision-Language Models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes with 30% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language task and create a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns with the inherent sequentiality of driving, enabling end-to-end trajectory prediction directly from camera input.

Method: Uses Vision-Language Models (VLM) for end-to-end trajectory prediction from front-view camera input, with a principled supervision strategy derived from statistical modeling and imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes dataset with over 30% improvement compared to prior baselines, and demonstrates superior generalization on cross-domain datasets from diverse vehicles.

Conclusion: The framework enables fundamental driving behaviors and lays the foundation for developing more capable self-driving agents with cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

### [12] [Efficient CNN Compression via Multi-method Low Rank Factorization and Feature Map Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00062)
*M. Kokhazadeh,G. Keramidas,V. Kelefouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end DSE framework for CNN compression using LRF with novel rank selection based on feature map similarity, one-shot fine-tuning, and integration of multiple LRF methods per layer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRF faces challenges in optimal rank selection, large design space, long fine-tuning times, and limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.

Method: Proposes feature map similarity-based rank selection, one-shot fine-tuning, and selective application of three LRF techniques each for Conv and FC layers on a per-layer basis.

Result: Achieves substantial compression with minimal accuracy loss on 14 CNN models across eight datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: Combining multiple LRF methods within a single model yields better compression than uniform application, and the framework is integrated into TensorFlow 2.x for compatibility.

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

presented establishes a new paradigm for integrating lean systems with emerging
AI technologies, offering scalability for implementation in automotive plants
of different sizes.

### [14] [Improved Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection via Unsupervised Subspace Modeling in the Signed Cumulative Distribution Transform Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00148)
*Abu Hasnat Mohammad Rubaiyat,Jordan Vincent,Colin Olson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hyperspectral anomaly detection method using transport-based mathematical modeling and SCDT domain representation to detect anomalous pixels as deviations from learned background models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral anomaly detection faces challenges in complex real-world environments with limited prior knowledge of target signatures, requiring improved techniques for civilian and military applications.

Method: Proposes a transport-based model where pixels are viewed as deformed template patterns, represented in SCDT domain, then uses unsupervised subspace modeling to learn background signals and detect anomalies as deviations.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The transport-based approach with SCDT domain representation effectively addresses HAD challenges and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OIG-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models' understanding of One-Image Guides - visual formats combining text, imagery, and symbols designed for human comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of MLLMs' capacity for human-like understanding in One-Image Guides is insufficiently explored, despite their importance in representing structured information for human perception.

Method: Developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline using multiple intelligent agents to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in constructing image-text pairs for the benchmark.

Result: Evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs showed Qwen2.5-VL-72B performs best with 77% accuracy, but all models exhibit weaknesses in semantic understanding and logical reasoning. The multi-agent annotation system outperforms all MLLMs in image captioning.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs still struggle to accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships in One-Image Guides, highlighting the need for improved semantic understanding and logical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

*Aaron Kujawa,Thomas Booth,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel binary encoding methods for medical image segmentation with many classes reduce computational complexity from linear to logarithmic, but face challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation performance compared to standard one-hot encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational and memory requirements that increase linearly with the number of classes in medical image segmentation, particularly for whole brain parcellation with 108 classes.

Method: Proposes binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding, including vanilla binary encoding, error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting, hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees.

Result: Binary encodings achieved Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) scores in the range of 39.3 to 73.8, significantly lower than the one-hot encoding baseline (DSC = 82.4).

Conclusion: While binary encodings reduce computational complexity, they face challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality, highlighting the need for future research on compact encoding strategies for large multi-class segmentation tasks.

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

Motivation: To unlock geospatial reasoning capabilities in vision-language models without requiring costly human reasoning annotations, by extending geospatial modeling from traditional domain pretraining/supervised finetuning to reasoning-first post-training.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Scaffolding stage uses supervised fine-tuning on synthetic chain-of-thought exemplars to instill a "geospatial thinking paradigm"; 2) Elevating stage employs GRPO-based reinforcement learning on weakly-supervised cross-view pairing proxy to provide verifiable and scalable reward signals.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across various geospatial reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating effective geospatial reasoning capabilities without human reasoning annotations.

Conclusion: Geo-R1 successfully extends geospatial modeling to reasoning-first post-training and provides a scalable framework for developing geospatial reasoning in vision-language models, with the model publicly available on HuggingFace.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

### [18] [Enhancing Certifiable Semantic Robustness via Robust Pruning of Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00083)
*Hanjiang Hu,Bowei Li,Ziwei Wang,Tianhao Wei,Casidhe Hutchison,Eric Sample,Changliu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a neural network pruning method based on an Unbiased and Smooth Neuron (USN) metric to improve robustness certification against semantic transformations like brightness and contrast perturbations, addressing over-parameterization challenges in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current certified training and robustness certification methods face challenges with over-parameterization in deep neural networks, which hinders tightness and scalability for verifying robustness against semantic transformation perturbations.

Method: The authors analyze layer and neuron stability against input perturbations, introduce a USN metric to identify certifiable robustness, and propose a pruning method that removes low-USN neurons while retaining high-USN ones. They also use a Wasserstein distance loss to concentrate pruned neurons across layers.

Result: Extensive experiments on robust keypoint detection with realistic brightness and contrast perturbations show that the method achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed USN-based pruning approach effectively addresses over-parameterization issues in robustness certification, maintaining model expressiveness while improving certification tightness and scalability for semantic transformation perturbations.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOLM is a watermarking framework that embeds binary keys into generative models using LoRA adapters, providing robust detection against distortions and attacks while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about detecting and attributing synthetically generated images, as existing watermarking methods are fragile to distortions, susceptible to removal, and expensive to update.

Method: Formulates encoding as key-dependent perturbation of generative model parameters using Mixture of LoRA Markers (MOLM), where binary keys activate lightweight LoRA adapters in residual and attention blocks.

Result: Experiments on Stable Diffusion and FLUX show MOLM preserves image quality while achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression, regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: MOLM provides an effective watermarking solution that avoids key-specific retraining and achieves imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness properties.

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

TL;DR: CROWD is a combinatorial framework for Open-World Object Detection that addresses semantic confusion and catastrophic forgetting through strategic unknown instance mining and joint representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OWOD approaches suffer from semantic confusion between known/unknown classes and catastrophic forgetting, leading to reduced unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy.

Method: CROWD-Discover uses Submodular Conditional Gain functions to strategically mine unknown instances distinct from known objects. CROWD-Learn employs combinatorial objectives to disentangle known/unknown representations while maintaining discriminative coherence among known classes.

Result: Achieves 2.83% and 2.05% improvements in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and S-OWODB benchmarks, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading baselines.

Conclusion: CROWD effectively mitigates confusion and forgetting in open-world object detection through its combinatorial approach to discovery and learning.

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

*Arpan Mahara,Md Rezaul Karim Khan,Naphtali Rishe,Wenjia Wang,Seyed Masoud Sadjadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ExpDWT-VAE, a novel VAE architecture that enhances latent space representation for satellite imagery by integrating spatial and frequency domains using Discrete Wavelet Transform, improving Latent Diffusion Models for remote sensing applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) show advantages in remote sensing, existing research rarely focuses on improving the intrinsic latent space representation itself. Current approaches don't explicitly enhance the VAE's latent space construction.

Method: ExpDWT-VAE uses dual branches: one processes spatial domain with convolutions, while the other extracts frequency-domain features via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operations, and inverse DWT reconstruction. The integrated spatial-frequency representation is refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian mapping.

Result: Experimental validation on a new satellite imagery dataset from TerraFly mapping system shows significant improvements across multiple performance metrics, demonstrating enhanced latent space representation quality.

Conclusion: The proposed ExpDWT-VAE effectively enhances latent space representation for satellite imagery by leveraging both spatial and frequency domain information through wavelet transforms, providing a robust foundation for improved Latent Diffusion Models in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

Motivation: Existing trajectory prediction methods assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for real-world perceptual artifacts in first-person vision like occlusions, ID switches, and tracking drift, which limits model robustness in practical deployment.

Method: Proposed BiFlow - a dual-stream flow matching model that concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion using shared latent representation. Introduces EgoAnchor mechanism that conditions prediction decoder on distilled historical features via feature modulation.

Result: BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The EgoTraj-Bench benchmark and BiFlow model provide a critical foundation for developing trajectory forecasting systems that are truly resilient to the challenges of real-world, ego-centric perception.

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of

TL;DR: Comparative analysis shows that supervised CNNs are strong baselines for chest X-ray diagnosis, but zero-shot VLMs can match or exceed their performance when properly calibrated with optimized decision thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of zero-shot medical Vision-Language Models (VLMs) compared to supervised CNNs for chest radiograph interpretation, particularly for pneumonia and tuberculosis detection.

Method: Comparative analysis between supervised lightweight CNN and zero-shot BiomedCLIP VLM on PneumoniaMNIST (pneumonia detection) and Shenzhen TB dataset (tuberculosis detection), with decision threshold calibration applied to the VLM.

Result: After calibration, BiomedCLIP achieved F1-score of 0.8841 for pneumonia detection (surpassing CNN's 0.8803) and 0.7684 for tuberculosis detection (close to CNN's 0.7834), showing significant improvement from default zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: Proper calibration is essential for unlocking the full diagnostic potential of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to compete with or outperform task-specific supervised models in medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match

Motivation: Existing GUI agents struggle with long-horizon tasks due to memory constraints, either truncating history or using simple textual summaries that risk losing critical visual information needed for future decisions.

Method: PAL-UI combines a dual-level summarization agent (capturing observation-level cues and action-level outcomes) with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows recalling specific historical screenshots during planning. Models are trained on 8.6K mobile GUI navigation samples based on Qwen2.5-VL.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of active memory retrieval for enhancing long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet
long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing
approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which
risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for

a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and

recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level
instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and
train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms

Method: Developed Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool with multiple clinically relevant interaction methods including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and scribbles for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation.

Result: Achieved substantial improvement with Dice similarity coefficients up to 77.6% and Intersection over Union scores of 64.8% on 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from BraTS 2025 Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge.

Conclusion: Results emphasize the need for clinically tailored segmentation solutions in critical applications like meningioma RT planning, with the code publicly available.

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of

TL;DR: BindWeave is a unified framework for subject-consistent video generation that handles single-subject to complex multi-subject scenes using MLLM-DiT architecture for cross-modal reasoning and diffusion transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models struggle with subject-consistent generation due to difficulty parsing prompts with complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and multi-subject interactions.

Method: Proposes MLLM-DiT framework where pretrained multimodal large language model performs cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and disentangle roles/attributes/interactions, generating subject-aware hidden states that condition diffusion transformer.

Result: Experiments on OpenS2V benchmark show superior performance in subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance, outperforming existing open-source and commercial models.

Conclusion: BindWeave effectively addresses subject-consistent video generation challenges through unified framework handling diverse subject scenarios with improved performance.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

*Wang Zhang,Huaqiu Li,Xiaowan Hu,Tao Jiang,Zikang Chen,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCNet addresses limitations in self-supervised denoising by controlling spectral learning, using frequency band selection, Lipschitz-based parameter optimization, and a spectral separation module to preserve high-frequency details while reducing noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised denoising methods fail to preserve high-frequency structural details and learn high-frequency noise from mapped noisy images, as revealed by spectral bias analysis using Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity.

Method: Proposes SCNet with three components: frequency band selection strategy for faster convergence, Lipschitz-constant-based parameter optimization to restrict high-frequency noise learning, and SSR module for spectral separation and low-rank reconstruction to preserve high-frequency details.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate SCNet's effectiveness in improving denoising performance while preserving high-frequency structural details.

Conclusion: SCNet successfully addresses spectral bias issues in self-supervised denoising through spectral control mechanisms, achieving better preservation of high-frequency details and reduced noise learning.

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

Motivation: Vision-language object detectors perform well in zero-shot settings but degrade under domain shifts, requiring adaptation methods to maintain performance across diverse conditions.

Method: Uses IoU-weighted entropy objective to focus adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and image-conditioned prompt selection to rank and fuse the most informative prompts with detector logits.

Result: Shows consistent improvements over zero-shot and TTA baselines across diverse distribution shifts including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light conditions, and common corruptions on YOLO-World and Grounding DINO.

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA effectively adapts vision-language object detectors to domain shifts through proposal clustering and prompt selection, demonstrating robust performance across various challenging conditions.

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

Conclusion: MathSticks establishes a rigorous testbed for advancing compositional reasoning across vision and symbols, highlighting the gap between current AI models and human performance in visual symbolic reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic

### [30] [Normal-Abnormal Guided Generalist Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00495)
*Yuexin Wang,Xiaolei Wang,Yizheng Gong,Jimin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) framework for generalist anomaly detection that uses both normal and anomalous samples as references, outperforming previous methods that only used normal samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous GAD methods only used normal samples as references, ignoring valuable information from anomalous samples that are often available in real-world scenarios.

Method: NAGL framework with two components: Residual Mining (RM) extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals, and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL) adaptively learns anomaly features through residual mapping.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show the method significantly outperforms existing GAD approaches.

Conclusion: This is the first work to adopt a mixture of normal and abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection, enabling more accurate and efficient cross-domain anomaly detection.

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

*Kaiqi Zhang,Mingguan Yang,Dali Chang,Chun Chen,Yuxiang Zhang,Kexun He,Jing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAF (Relative-Absolute Fusion) is a feature extraction technique that enhances image-based iterative method selection for sparse linear systems by fusing relative image features with absolute numerical values to prevent feature ambiguity and improve selection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-based selection approaches for sparse linear systems suffer from feature ambiguity where distinct matrices can have identical image representations, leading to suboptimal method selection and reduced robustness.

Method: RAF simultaneously extracts and fuses image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical values as absolute features, creating comprehensive matrix representations that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices.

Result: Evaluation on SuiteSparse and BMCMat datasets showed solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s (5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based approaches) and achieved state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: RAF effectively enhances image-based selection approaches by preventing feature ambiguity, improving selection accuracy, and unlocking the potential of image-based methods for iterative solver selection in sparse linear systems.

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

### [32] [Affordance-Guided Diffusion Prior for 3D Hand Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00506)
*Naru Suzuki,Takehiko Ohkawa,Tatsuro Banno,Jihyun Lee,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative prior method using diffusion models and affordance-aware textual descriptions to refine 3D hand poses in heavily occluded scenarios, improving accuracy through contextual reasoning about hand-object interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reconstructing 3D hand poses when large portions are heavily occluded by objects or self-occlusion, by leveraging human-like contextual knowledge about object affordances.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based generative model conditioned on affordance descriptions inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM) to refine occluded hand poses, making them more accurate and functionally coherent.

Result: Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet dataset show significant improvement in hand pose estimation over recent regression methods and diffusion-based refinement without contextual reasoning.

Conclusion: Affordance-guided refinement using generative models and textual descriptions effectively resolves ambiguities in heavily occluded hand pose estimation by incorporating functional context about hand-object interactions.

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

TL;DR: EPIC is a progressive learning framework that improves multi-modal large model efficiency through token compression with consistency distillation to reduce training difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in MLLMs, and existing compression methods overlook the increased learning difficulty caused by feature space perturbations from token compression.

Method: Decompose feature space perturbations along token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, then apply token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation using guidance from a teacher model with progressive learning.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior effectiveness, robustness, and generalization capabilities of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: EPIC successfully addresses the training difficulty in token compression for MLLMs through progressive consistency distillation, achieving efficient models with maintained performance.

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

TL;DR: CardioBench is a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography foundation models that unifies 8 public datasets across 9 tasks, evaluating various FMs under consistent protocols to establish standardized evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are transforming medical imaging but lack standardized evaluation in echocardiography due to unique challenges like noisy data, frame redundancy, and limited public datasets, with most existing solutions using private data that restricts comparability.

Method: Created CardioBench by unifying 8 publicly available datasets into standardized suite spanning 4 regression and 5 classification tasks. Evaluated cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose encoders under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols.

Result: Found complementary strengths: temporal modeling critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness under distribution shift, domain-specific text encoders capture physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer well but struggle with fine-grained distinctions.

Conclusion: CardioBench establishes reproducible reference point for echocardiography FMs and offers actionable insights to guide future model design, with released preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

### [35] [Cascaded Diffusion Framework for Probabilistic Coarse-to-Fine Hand Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00527)
*Taeyun Woo,Jinah Park,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework for 3D hand pose reconstruction that combines probabilistic modeling with cascaded refinement to address pose ambiguities and capture pose uncertainties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic models struggle with pose ambiguities from self-occlusions and complex articulations, while probabilistic methods are limited to single-stage estimation without refinement capabilities.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) joint diffusion model samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, (2) Mesh Latent Diffusion Model reconstructs 3D hand mesh conditioned on joint samples, trained with diverse hypotheses in learned latent space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 datasets while effectively modeling pose distributions.

Conclusion: The cascaded diffusion framework successfully combines probabilistic modeling with sequential refinement, learning distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships and robust hand priors to overcome limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

*Aoduo Li,Peikai Lin,Jiancheng Li,Zhen Zhang,Shiting Wu,Zexiao Liang,Zhifa Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Forestpest-YOLO is a YOLOv8-based detection framework optimized for detecting small, occluded agricultural pests in forestry remote sensing imagery, achieving state-of-the-art performance through lossless downsampling, cross-stage feature fusion, and improved loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting agricultural pests in forestry environments is challenging due to small target size, heavy occlusion, visual similarity to background clutter, and extreme data imbalance, causing conventional object detection models to fail.

Method: Built on YOLOv8 with three key innovations: 1) SPD-Conv for lossless downsampling to preserve small target details, 2) CSPOK cross-stage feature fusion block for enhanced multi-scale representation and background noise suppression, 3) VarifocalLoss to focus on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on the ForestPest dataset show Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance with marked improvements in detecting small, occluded pests, significantly outperforming established baseline models.

Conclusion: Forestpest-YOLO effectively addresses the challenges of pest detection in forestry remote sensing through its optimized architecture and training strategy, demonstrating superior performance for this specialized application.

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

*Henrik Pichler,Janis Keuper,Matthew Copping*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision foundation models like MaskDINO can achieve near-parity performance with extensively trained traditional models (YoloV9) using only 1-3% of the training data (25-150 images) for mold colony detection on Petri dishes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that exhaustive manual annotation is no longer necessary for new vision tasks, challenging the traditional approach of collecting large annotated datasets for microbiology automation.

Method: Compiled a dataset of 5000 Petri dish images with bounding boxes and instance masks, benchmarked three vision foundation models against traditional baselines in few-shot and low-shot scenarios.

Result: MaskDINO achieved near-parity with extensively trained YoloV9 using only 150 images, maintained competitive performance with just 25 images (reliable on ~70% of samples).

Conclusion: Data-efficient foundation models can match traditional approaches with minimal data, enabling faster development of automated microbiological systems with superior performance upper bounds.

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive Shared Experts (ASE) with LoRA-based MoE to improve multi-task learning by enabling better STL-to-MTL transition, expert specialization, and fine-grained knowledge sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing MoE-MTL methods that rely on single-task pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient knowledge sharing during STL to MTL transition.

Method: ASE with LoRA-based MoE where shared experts get router-computed gating weights normalized with sparse experts, plus fine-grained experts by increasing LoRA expert count while proportionally reducing rank.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL-Context benchmark show ASE consistently improves performance across diverse configurations and validates fine-grained designs for MTL.

Conclusion: ASE effectively facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization and cooperation, and enables more effective knowledge sharing under comparable parameter budget.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

TL;DR: ArbInterp is a flexible video frame interpolation framework that can generate frames at any timestamp and of any length, overcoming limitations of fixed-rate methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative VFI methods are constrained to synthesize fixed numbers of intermediate frames, lacking flexibility to adjust frame rates or sequence duration.

Method: Proposes Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding (TaRoPE) for any-timestamp interpolation, and decomposes long sequences into segments with appearance-motion decoupled conditioning for seamless transitions.

Result: Outperforms prior methods across all scenarios (2x to 32x interpolation) with higher fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity.

Conclusion: ArbInterp enables efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length, providing fine-grained control over frame generation while maintaining spatiotemporal coherence.

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

TL;DR: MDS-NeRF is a novel neural radiance field approach for 3D style transfer that uses multi-level feature grids and dynamic style injection to better preserve content structure while achieving superior artistic stylization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF-based style transfer methods integrate style statistics into the original NeRF pipeline, leading to suboptimal results in both content preservation and artistic stylization.

Method: Proposes multi-level feature adaptor to generate multi-level feature grid representation, dynamic style injection module to extract and integrate style features adaptively, and multi-level cascade decoder to transform stylized features into final views.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate outstanding performance for 3D style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively transferring stylistic characteristics.

Conclusion: MDS-NeRF successfully reengineers the NeRF pipeline for stylization and supports omni-view style transfer using 3D style references.

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high costs and inefficiencies of manual defect labeling in infrastructure safety while enabling scalable, cost-effective dataset construction.

Method: Integrates LVLMs with semantic pattern matching and iterative self-questioning refinement, using optimized domain-specific prompting and recursive verification to transform raw visual data into labeled datasets.

Result: Achieves 98% accuracy in defective/non-defective classification, 85%-98% annotation accuracy across four defect categories in balanced settings, and 80%-92% accuracy on imbalanced datasets.

Conclusion: ADPT provides a scalable, cost-effective solution for high-quality dataset construction, supporting downstream tasks like transfer learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect

accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced
settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework
offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset
construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer
learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

*Yunbo Xu,Xuesong Zhang,Jia Li,Zhenzhen Hu,Richang Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COFA is a vision-language navigation strategy that uses foreground-background feature augmentation to improve navigational generalization by leveraging semantic cues from foreground and spatial connectivity from background.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN approaches underutilize the distinct roles of foreground (semantic cues) and background (spatial connectivity) in visual observations, limiting navigational generalization.

Method: Uses semantically-enhanced landmark identification to disentangle foreground/background features, then applies consensus-driven online augmentation with two-stage voting on feature preferences based on instructions and locations.

Result: Experiments on REVERIE and R2R show improved generalization over baselines and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Online foreground-background feature augmentation effectively enhances VLN agent generalization by leveraging complementary visual information from different scene regions.

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

### [44] [Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00618)
*Klara Janouskova,Cristian Gavrus,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RCOR is a robust context-aware object recognition method that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness by treating localization as integral to recognition, decoupling object-centric and context-aware modeling, and using non-parametric fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised learning often causes models to over-rely on background context (shortcut learning), limiting real-world robustness. Existing approaches suppress background but sacrifice useful context information.

Method: RCOR treats localization as integral to recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modeling, followed by robust non-parametric fusion. It enables localization before recognition even in complex scenes.

Result: Improves performance of both supervised models and VLMs on datasets with in-domain and out-of-domain backgrounds, even without fine-tuning. Works effectively on complex scenes like ImageNet-1k.

Conclusion: RCOR demonstrates that localization before recognition is feasible in complex scenes and provides a solution that maintains both robustness and context-awareness without compromising either aspect.

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

*Mengfei Xia,Nan Xue,Jiapeng Zhu,Yujun Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using an unconditional discriminator (UCD) in GAN training to improve convergence and avoid mode collapse by forcing the discriminator to extract more comprehensive features without condition injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN training often fails to converge properly and suffers from mode collapse. The authors identify that conditional discriminators create redundant shortcuts that prevent meaningful knowledge extraction, hindering Nash equilibrium.

Method: Replace conditional discriminator with unconditional discriminator (UCD) that extracts features without condition injection, forcing more comprehensive feature learning. This is theoretically compatible with vanilla GAN and can be implemented as a plug-in.

Result: Achieved 1.47 FID on ImageNet-64, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and state-of-the-art one-step diffusion models. Shows significant performance improvements with high efficiency.

Conclusion: UCD promotes better Nash equilibrium in GAN training by enabling discriminators to leverage more comprehensive knowledge to supervise generators, leading to improved convergence and performance.

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

*Yannick Hauri,Luca A. Lanzendörfer,Till Aczel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces virtual fashion photo-shoot, transforming garment images into editorial fashion imagery with dynamic poses and contextual narratives, using a novel dataset of garment-lookbook pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fashion image generation focuses on narrow tasks like virtual try-on in clean studio environments, lacking the creative richness, dynamic poses, and storytelling found in editorial fashion photography.

Method: Created a large-scale dataset of garment-lookbook pairs using an automated retrieval pipeline that combines visual-language reasoning with object-level localization to align garments across e-commerce and fashion media domains.

Result: Constructed a dataset with three quality levels: 10,000 high-quality pairs, 50,000 medium-quality pairs, and 300,000 low-quality pairs, providing a foundation for creative fashion imagery generation.

Conclusion: The work enables models to move beyond catalog-style generation toward fashion imagery that captures creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

*Jiayao Jiang,Siran Peng,Bin Liu,Qi Chu,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel deepfake detection method using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with learnable splines and a landmark-assisted module (LAKAN) to focus on critical facial areas with forgery artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNN and Transformer-based deepfake detection methods need improvement in modeling the complex, non-linear nature of forgery artifacts.

Method: Uses KAN with learnable splines instead of fixed activation functions, and introduces LAKAN module that uses facial landmarks as structural prior to dynamically generate KAN parameters and guide attention to artifact-rich facial regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed KAN-based approach with landmark guidance effectively combines geometric priors with network learning for improved deepfake detection.

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

*Nanxiang Jiang,Zhaoxin Fan,Enhan Kang,Daiheng Gao,Yun Zhou,Yanxia Chang,Zheng Zhu,Yeying Jin,Wenjun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReFlux is a concept attack method designed to test the robustness of concept erasure in rectified flow-based text-to-image models like Flux, using reverse-attention optimization and velocity guidance to reactivate suppressed concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods and attack evaluations are tailored for Stable Diffusion and show limited effectiveness when applied to next-generation rectified flow transformers like Flux, creating a need for specialized attack methods.

Method: The approach uses reverse-attention optimization to reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention, reinforced by velocity-guided dynamics to steer flow matching and a consistency-preserving objective to maintain global layout and unrelated content.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ReFlux, establishing a reliable benchmark for evaluating concept erasure robustness in rectified flow transformers.

Conclusion: ReFlux successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by specifically targeting attention localization in Flux models, providing an effective tool for assessing concept erasure robustness in next-generation text-to-image frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-sensor fusion is needed for robust perception in autonomous vehicles, combining camera semantic information with radar distance measurements. Map segmentation faces challenges in achieving both high accuracy and real-time performance.

Method: Uses camera-radar fusion in BEV space with an advanced loss set and new lightweight head to improve perception results while maintaining real-time performance.

Result: Achieves 53.5 mIoU (comparable to large models) and sets new benchmark for inference time with 260% improvement over strongest baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture successfully addresses the trade-off between accuracy and real-time performance in map segmentation for autonomous vehicles through efficient camera-radar fusion.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SpecMCD, a weakly supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and multi-scale scene-level deep networks to generate accurate pixel-level cloud masks from optical satellite images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clouds degrade optical satellite image quality, limiting applications. Current deep learning methods struggle with thin clouds and low-quality training samples, leaving room for improvement in cloud detection accuracy.

Method: Uses progressive training with multi-scale scene-level dataset, combines multi-scale probability maps with cloud thickness maps, and applies adaptive thresholds with distance-weighted optimization to generate binary cloud masks.

Result: Tested on WDCD and GF1MS-WHU datasets (60 Gaofen-1 multispectral images), SpecMCD achieved over 7.82% improvement in F1-score compared to other weakly supervised methods like WDCD and WSFNet.

Conclusion: SpecMCD demonstrates superior performance for cloud detection under different cloud coverage conditions, showing strong potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

*Beomsu Kim,Byunghee Cha,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Align Your Tangent (AYT), a method that accelerates Consistency Models training by using manifold feature distance loss to reduce oscillatory tangents and provide manifold-aligned update directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consistency Models require prolonged training with large batch sizes to achieve competitive sample quality, and their training dynamics near convergence show oscillatory tangents that move parallel to rather than toward the data manifold.

Method: Proposes manifold feature distance (MFD) loss function that provides manifold-aligned tangents pointing toward the data manifold, enabling faster convergence and training with smaller batch sizes.

Result: AYT accelerates CM training by orders of magnitude, outperforms LPIPS metric, and enables training with extremely small batch sizes without compromising sample quality.

Conclusion: The proposed AYT method effectively addresses oscillatory tangent issues in CM training, significantly improving training efficiency and enabling practical deployment with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

*Huaying Li,Liansheng Wang,Yinran Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes U2-rPCA, an unsupervised unfolded robust PCA method for ultrasound clutter filtering that preserves interpretability and doesn't require ground truth labels, achieving 2-10 dB CNR improvement over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SVD and rPCA methods have limitations in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow separation, while supervised deep learning filters face interpretability issues and lack of ground truth labels for training.

Method: Unfolds iteratively reweighted least squares rPCA with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization, adds sparse-enhancement unit to capture micro-flow signals, and trains adaptively on part of image sequence.

Result: Outperformed SVD-based method, rPCA baseline, and other deep learning filters on in-silico and in-vivo datasets, improving power Doppler CNR by 2-10 dB.

Conclusion: U2-rPCA successfully addresses interpretability and ground truth challenges in ultrasound clutter filtering while achieving superior performance through unsupervised learning.

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

TL;DR: A framework for brain vessel segmentation using image-to-image translation with disentanglement techniques to handle multiple imaging modalities and domains without requiring domain-specific models or data harmonization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain vessel morphology is complex and current segmentation models are limited to single imaging modalities, but comprehensive cerebrovascular understanding requires multi-modal analysis across different acquisition procedures.

Method: Employ disentanglement techniques to independently manipulate image properties, specifically focusing on vessel appearances while preserving spatial information like shapes and locations. Uses image-to-image translation for domain adaptation.

Result: Effectively bridges large domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types. Shows robustness and versatility in cerebrovascular image segmentation across multiple scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of domain adaptation methodologies for accurate cerebrovascular image segmentation in diverse clinical settings without requiring extensive domain-specific design or data harmonization.

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

*Leah Bar,Liron Mor Yosef,Shai Zucker,Neta Shoham,Inbar Seroussi,Nir Sochen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper unifies geometric and probabilistic perspectives in generative AI by proposing a framework that interprets diffusion models as projections onto the manifold of "good images", leading to a new deterministic model called MPPM that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative AI approaches overlook geometric structure and focus only on probabilistic methods, treating probability distributions in latent space as uninteresting or predefined. The study aims to bridge this gap by unifying geometric and probabilistic perspectives.

Method: The paper provides a geometric framework with kernel-based probabilistic methods, interpreting diffusion models as projection mechanisms onto image manifolds. This leads to the development of Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM) operating in both pixel and latent spaces.

Result: The Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior performance in image restoration and generation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully unifies geometric and probabilistic approaches, providing new insights into diffusion models and demonstrating improved performance through the MPPM architecture.

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

### [56] [Adaptive Event Stream Slicing for Open-Vocabulary Event-Based Object Detection via Vision-Language Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00681)
*Jinchang Zhang,Zijun Li,Jiakai Lin,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an event-image knowledge distillation framework using CLIP to enable open-vocabulary object detection on event camera data, overcoming modality gaps through spatial attention-based distillation and a hybrid SNN-CNN architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras have advantages for object detection but lack texture/color information, making open-vocabulary detection challenging. Current methods are limited to predefined categories and cannot generalize to novel objects.

Method: Uses image frames as teacher model inputs to guide event-based student model via spatial attention-based distillation. Implements hybrid SNN-CNN framework where SNN adaptively determines optimal event segmentation moments to preserve temporal information, and CNNs process features for detection.

Result: The framework enables event-based models to learn CLIP's rich visual representations directly from raw event inputs while inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge for open-vocabulary detection.

Conclusion: The proposed knowledge distillation approach successfully bridges the modality gap between images and event streams, enabling open-vocabulary object detection on event data while preserving crucial temporal information through adaptive SNN segmentation.

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

*Steffen Meinert,Philipp Schlinge,Nils Strodthoff,Martin Atzmueller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProtoMask improves XAI by using image segmentation foundation models to create more truthful saliency maps, restricting computations to predefined semantic patches to reduce uncertainty in visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prototypical case-based XAI methods rely on post-hoc saliency techniques that have reliability and quality issues. The authors aim to improve truthfulness of embedding-to-input space mapping.

Method: Uses image segmentation foundation models to generate masks, crops images using bounding boxes from each mask, and processes each mask as individual input in the novel ProtoMask architecture.

Result: Experiments on three fine-grained classification datasets show competitive performance and unique explainability features compared to other popular models.

Conclusion: ProtoMask provides improved explainability through semantic segmentation-based approach, reducing uncertainty in saliency visualizations while maintaining competitive classification performance.

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

*Jiakai Lin,Jinchang Zhang,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-SGT enhances Concept Bottleneck Models by incorporating structured concept relationships through graph transformers and a Mixture of Experts module, improving interpretability and reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional CBMs which are single modal and ignore structured concept relationships, aiming to improve interpretability in high-stakes domains.

Method: Construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs for multimodal inputs, integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi-level dependencies, and replace feed forward layers with Mixture of Experts module for dynamic expert allocation.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships and using dynamic expert selection.

Conclusion: MoE-SGT successfully overcomes limitations of traditional CBMs through structured graph modeling and dynamic expert allocation, enhancing adaptability to complex concept reasoning.

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

*Sanghwan Kim,Rui Xiao,Stephan Alaniz,Yongqin Xian,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free framework that uses MLLMs' intrinsic uncertainty to guide fine-grained perception in visual tasks, achieving competitive performance without task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained perception tasks like identifying small objects or key moments, and existing methods require complex task-specific fine-tuning that limits generalizability.

Method: Proposes using MLLMs' output entropy as a proactive guidance signal - entropy decreases with relevant visual information. A unified mechanism scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty to autonomously focus on salient data.

Result: Applied to Visual Search, Long Video Understanding, and Temporal Grounding tasks, achieving performance competitive with specialized fine-tuned methods using off-the-shelf MLLMs.

Conclusion: Harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance without requiring training or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning-based motion correction for stress perfusion CMR enables fast, robust alignment of perfusion series and auxiliary images, reducing processing time 15-fold while improving temporal smoothness and maintaining comparable myocardial alignment to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional registration-based motion correction methods for quantitative stress perfusion CMR are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness and scalability in clinical practice.

Method: Unsupervised deep learning pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot estimation, using robust principal component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. Corrects motion in three steps and aligns perfusion series with arterial input function and proton density-weighted series.

Result: Significantly improved temporal smoothness (p<0.001), comparable myocardial alignment (Dice = 0.92 vs 0.91 baseline), reduced standard deviation in perfusion maps (0.52 vs 0.55 ml/min/g), and 15-fold reduction in processing time.

Conclusion: The deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and auxiliary images, and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

*Annemarie Hoffsommer,Helen Schneider,Svetlana Pavlitska,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that emotion prediction using only 12 EEG channels achieves 91.57% accuracy, nearly matching state-of-the-art results with 32 channels, enabling effective low-cost EEG devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate emotion prediction using low-cost EEG devices with simplified channel configurations, overcoming the complexity and resource-intensity of full EEG measurements.

Method: Used Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data into scaleograms and trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion classification using subsets of EEG channels from the DEAP dataset.

Result: Achieved 91.57% accuracy in predicting 4 emotion quadrants (high/low arousal and valence) using only 12 EEG channels, compared to state-of-the-art 96.9% with 32 channels.

Conclusion: Significant reduction of EEG input channels can yield high accuracy results, making emotion prediction feasible with low-cost EEG devices while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

*Hongeun Kim,Bryan Sangwoo Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel framework for Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR) that decomposes the challenging ELQ-to-HQ restoration process into two steps: first mapping ELQ images to an intermediate LQ manifold, then using frozen BIR models for final restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Blind Image Restoration methods fail with extreme degradations beyond their training scope, leading to artifacts and detail loss due to the massive domain gap between extremely low-quality and high-quality images.

Method: Uses a projector to map ELQ images to an intermediate LQ manifold, then applies frozen off-the-shelf BIR models. Grounded in information theory with a novel Information Bottleneck perspective and theoretically-driven objective to train the projector.

Result: Framework enables Look Forward Once for inference-time prompt refinement and plug-and-play strengthening of existing restoration models without finetuning. Extensive experiments show effectiveness under severe degradation regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed decomposition approach effectively addresses EBIR challenges by bridging the domain gap through intermediate representation learning, providing stable training and enhanced restoration performance for severely degraded images.

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

TL;DR: This paper presents an automatic defect detection system for ceramic manufacturing using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images and Deep Learning with U-Net architecture, achieving high accuracy and fast inference times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-destructive testing is crucial in ceramic manufacturing to ensure component quality without damaging them. OCT provides high-resolution internal imaging to detect defects like pores, delaminations, and inclusions, but manual analysis is time-consuming and subjective.

Method: Developed a neural network based on U-Net architecture trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations. Evaluated multiple experimental configurations and applied post-processing techniques for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of predictions.

Result: Achieved an accurate behavior of 0.979 Dice Score, outperforming comparable studies. The system has an inference time of 18.98 seconds per volume, demonstrating viability for practical applications.

Conclusion: The proposed system enables more efficient, reliable, and automated quality control in ceramic manufacturing by providing fast and accurate defect detection using OCT imaging and deep learning.

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure
the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this
context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal
imaging, revealing defects such as pores, delaminations, or inclusions. This
paper presents an automatic defect detection system based on Deep Learning
(DL), trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations. A neural
network based on the U-Net architecture is developed, evaluating multiple
experimental configurations to enhance its performance. Post-processing
techniques enable both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the
predictions. The system shows an accurate behavior of 0.979 Dice Score,
outperforming comparable studies. The inference time of 18.98 seconds per

*Eunki Kim,Na Min An,James Thorne,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MULTI-TAP is a plug-and-play architecture for evaluating image-text alignment that addresses limitations in existing methods by providing human-aligned, efficient multi-objective scoring through lightweight training on frozen LVLM hidden states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image-text alignment evaluation lacks comprehensive benchmarks and existing predictors miss key properties: human judgment alignment, long-sequence processing, inference efficiency, and multi-objective scoring capability, especially important for real-world scenarios with multiple valid descriptions.

Method: Proposes MULTI-TAP architecture using a reward head on LVLMs, training lightweight ridge regression on frozen hidden states to produce both overall and fine-grained multi-objective scores without full model retraining.

Result: MULTI-TAP outperforms existing metrics, achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o-based G-VEval with smaller models (7-8B), and beats VisionREWARD in both performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and new EYE4ALL dataset.

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP provides a robust, efficient solution for multi-objective image-text alignment evaluation, with new EYE4ALL dataset capturing diverse human preferences including BLV individuals, enabling more accessible AI systems.

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

*Joana C. Costa,Tiago Roxo,Hugo Proença,Pedro R. M. Inácio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero Query Black-box Adversarial (ZQBA) attack uses feature maps from one DNN to create adversarial samples that fool other models, requiring no queries and outperforming single-query state-of-the-art attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box attacks require multiple queries or diffusion models, limiting real-world applicability. ZQBA aims to create effective adversarial attacks without queries or training surrogate models.

Method: Extracts feature maps from a DNN and adds them to clean images to create adversarial samples that impair classification of target models.

Result: ZQBA successfully transfers adversarial samples across different models and datasets (CIFAR, Tiny ImageNet), outperforms single-query state-of-the-art attacks, and maintains imperceptible perturbations (verified by SSIM and qualitative evaluation).

Conclusion: ZQBA demonstrates effective zero-query black-box adversarial attacks by exploiting DNN representations, revealing vulnerabilities in real-world DNN deployments while requiring no queries to target models.

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

*Haifei Zhang,Patrick Barry,Eduardo Brandao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an uncertainty-aware interpretable classifier for Concept Bottleneck Models that uses binary class-level concept prototypes to improve both interpretability and predictive performance while enabling conformal prediction for uncertain inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs sacrifice predictive performance compared to end-to-end CNNs and lack proper uncertainty propagation from concept predictions to final label decisions.

Method: Learns binary class-level concept prototypes and uses distances between predicted concept vectors and prototypes as classification scores and uncertainty measures. Prototypes serve as interpretable classification rules.

Result: The framework enhances interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction for uncertain or outlier inputs based on deviation from learned prototypes.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves CBMs by incorporating uncertainty awareness while maintaining interpretability through binary class-level concept prototypes.

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

*Yifan Shen,Yangyang Shu,Hye-young Paik,Yulei Sui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaLogic is a novel evaluation framework that detects semantic inconsistencies in text-to-image models by comparing image pairs generated from logically equivalent but grammatically different prompts, revealing robustness failures without needing ground truth images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with maintaining semantic consistency when prompts undergo minor linguistic variations, exposing limitations in logical reasoning and generalization despite improved visual quality.

Method: MetaLogic uses metamorphic testing to generate image pairs from semantically identical but grammatically different prompts, then directly compares these pairs to identify alignment failures and categorize errors like entity omission, duplication, and positional misalignment.

Result: Evaluation across state-of-the-art T2I models revealed significant robustness failures, with Flux.dev showing 59% misalignment rate and DALLE-3 showing 71% misalignment rate across various logical constructs.

Conclusion: MetaLogic provides an efficient, scalable, and ground-truth-free approach that effectively uncovers fine-grained logical inconsistencies overlooked by existing evaluation metrics, enabling better model debugging and refinement.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.

TL;DR: ADQA is a QA benchmark for evaluating audio descriptions (ADs) on coherent video segments, addressing subjectivity in AD generation and showing current methods lag behind human-authored ADs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AD evaluation focuses on short clips and single references, ignoring the inherent subjectivity in AD writing and inadequate for testing story understanding and visual appreciation.

Method: Proposed ADQA benchmark with visual appreciation (VA) questions about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on plot, evaluated on few-minute long video segments.

Result: Quantified subjectivity in AD writing through analysis of independent AD tracks, and showed current AD generation methods perform significantly worse than human-authored ADs.

Conclusion: Working with trimmed clips is inadequate; ADQA provides better evaluation for story understanding and visual appreciation, with recommendations for future work and public leaderboard for benchmarking.

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

*Thomas Campagnolo,Ezio Malis,Philippe Martinet,Gaetan Bahl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhraseStereo is the first dataset that extends phrase grounding to stereo image pairs, enabling multimodal semantic segmentation with depth cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current phrase grounding methods are limited to single-view images and miss the geometric information available in stereo vision, which could improve segmentation accuracy.

Method: The dataset is created by leveraging GenStereo to generate right-view images from existing PhraseCut single-view data, providing stereo pairs with aligned segmentation masks and phrase annotations.

Result: PhraseStereo introduces a new setting for phrase-region segmentation in stereo images, creating opportunities for models to use depth information for more precise grounding.

Conclusion: This dataset establishes a foundation for research combining language, vision, and 3D perception, encouraging joint reasoning over semantics and geometry in multimodal learning.

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

### [72] [NSARM: Next-Scale Autoregressive Modeling for Robust Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00820)
*Xiangtao Kong,Rongyuan Wu,Shuaizheng Liu,Lingchen Sun,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSARM is a robust Real-ISR framework using next-scale autoregressive modeling that achieves superior visual quality and faster inference while maintaining high robustness to varying input degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Real-ISR methods using diffusion models face trade-offs between quality and speed - diffusion from noise is slow but realistic, while direct mapping is fast but lower quality. Current approaches also suffer from over-enhanced artifacts and poor robustness to varying input degradations.

Method: Two-stage training: first train a transformation network to map low-quality images to preliminary scales, then perform end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Uses next-scale prediction strategy from visual autoregressive models like Infinity.

Result: Achieves superior visual results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining fast inference speed. Demonstrates much higher robustness to input image quality and stronger generalization performance.

Conclusion: NSARM as a pure AR model provides an effective solution for Real-ISR that balances quality, speed, and robustness through comprehensive fine-tuning without compromising generative capability.

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

*Julius Ott,Nastassia Vysotskaya,Huawei Sun,Lorenzo Servadei,Robert Wille*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two hierarchical contrastive learning methods (G-HMLC and A-HMLC) that model inter-class relationships and imbalanced distributions across hierarchy levels, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100 and ModelNet40 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional classification approaches neglect inherent inter-class relationships at different hierarchy levels, missing important supervisory signals for hierarchical classification tasks.

Method: Two novel hierarchical contrastive learning methods: G-HMLC using Gaussian Mixture Model and A-HMLC using attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features and model inter-class relationships across hierarchy levels.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR100 and ModelNet40 datasets, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by 2 percentage points in accuracy in linear evaluation.

Conclusion: The approach effectively models hierarchical relationships and imbalanced distributions, showing strong potential for computer vision applications and beyond, with both quantitative and qualitative validation.

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

*Kevin Zhang,Kuangzhi Ge,Xiaowei Chi,Renrui Zhang,Shaojun Shi,Zhen Dong,Sirui Han,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World-Language Models (WorldLMs) use video diffusion models as generative encoders for vision-language tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance by leveraging motion-consistency priors from video pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether generative world models can replace conventional vision encoders for multimodal understanding, given their ability to generate consistent dynamics over structure, motion, and physics.

Method: Repurpose a video diffusion model as a generative encoder by performing a single denoising step and using the resulting latents as visual embeddings. The best variant is called Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA).

Result: WorldLMs capture latents useful for downstream understanding that differ from conventional encoders. DyVA significantly enhances spatial reasoning and enables single-image models to perform multi-frame reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance on visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: WorldLMs represent a promising new family of vision-language models that leverage priors from world models, potentially leading towards generalist vision learners.

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

*Hyun-kyu Ko,Youbin Kim,Jihyeon Park,Dongheok Park,Gyeongjin Kang,Wonjun Cho,Hyung Yi,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GSMamba, a hybrid architecture combining Mamba's selective SSMs with shifted window self-attention for video super-resolution, addressing temporal propagation and spatial dependency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recurrent architectures for VSR suffer from vanishing gradients, lack of parallelism, and slow inference. While Mamba offers efficient temporal modeling, it struggles with spatial dependencies due to its causal nature.

Method: Hybrid architecture using shifted window self-attention for spatial context aggregation and Mamba-based selective scanning for temporal propagation. Introduces Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM) for alignment-aware feature warping to reduce occlusion artifacts.

Result: The method effectively combines efficient temporal propagation with spatial context modeling, addressing limitations of both pure SSMs and attention-based approaches for video super-resolution.

Conclusion: GSMamba demonstrates that hybrid architectures combining selective SSMs with attention mechanisms can overcome individual limitations and provide efficient, effective solutions for video super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

### [76] [AI-CNet3D: An Anatomically-Informed Cross-Attention Network with Multi-Task Consistency Fine-tuning for 3D Glaucoma Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00882)
*Roshan Kenia,Anfei Li,Rishabh Srivastava,Kaveri A. Thakoor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hybrid deep learning model called AI-CNet3D integrates cross-attention mechanisms into 3D CNNs for glaucoma diagnosis from OCT volumes, achieving superior performance with 100x fewer parameters than other attention models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional practice of condensing 3D OCT volumes into 2D reports loses key structural details needed for accurate glaucoma diagnosis, requiring better methods to preserve 3D information.

Method: Proposed AI-CNet3D model uses cross-attention mechanisms in 3D CNN to extract features from hemiretinas, optic nerve head, and macula. Introduces Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) for visualization and multi-task fine-tuning aligned with Grad-CAMs.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art attention and convolutional models across all key metrics on two large datasets. Computationally efficient with 100x parameter reduction while maintaining high diagnostic performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Conclusion: The AI-CNet3D model effectively captures anatomical asymmetries in glaucoma while being computationally efficient, offering improved interpretability and performance for glaucoma diagnosis from 3D OCT data.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

TL;DR: This study examines how machine learning practitioners select source datasets for transfer learning in medical imaging, finding that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset properties, and perceived similarities rather than systematic principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current source dataset selection in medical imaging transfer learning relies on researchers' intuition rather than systematic principles, which can impact algorithm generalizability and patient outcomes.

Method: Conducted a task-based survey with machine learning practitioners to understand their decision-making processes for source dataset selection, taking a human-centered HCI perspective.

Result: Practitioners' choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset properties, computational embeddings, and perceived visual/semantic similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always aligned, challenging the traditional "more similar is better" view.

Conclusion: The study reveals ambiguous terminology in dataset selection practices and suggests a need for clearer definitions and HCI tools to make selection heuristics explicit and usable, providing practical insights for more systematic source selection in transfer learning.

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

TL;DR: PAL-Net is an automated deep learning pipeline for localizing 50 anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans, combining coarse alignment, ROI filtering, and patch-based CNN with attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is time-consuming and expertise-dependent, limiting clinical applicability of existing deep learning methods that focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex inputs.

Method: Combines coarse alignment, region-of-interest filtering, initial landmark approximation, and patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.

Result: Achieved mean localization error of 3.686 mm on 214 annotated scans, with 2.822 mm average distance error comparable to intra-observer variability. On FaceScape dataset (700 subjects), achieved 0.41 mm point-wise and 0.38 mm distance-wise errors.

Conclusion: PAL-Net provides a lightweight, scalable solution for high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, outperforming existing methods and reducing reliance on manual annotation, though performance degrades in regions with poor mesh quality.

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable learning-based solutions for inverse problems when obtaining ground-truth training data is expensive or impossible, particularly in settings with single incomplete observation models.

Method: Combines self-supervised splitting losses with equivariant reconstruction networks, introducing a new definition of equivariance in reconstruction networks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on image inpainting, accelerated MRI, and compressive sensing tasks, especially with highly rank-deficient forward models.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised learning strategy with equivariant networks provides unbiased estimates of supervised loss and performs well in challenging incomplete measurement scenarios.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Vector Panning Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework for Cross-Resolution ReID, addressing resolution differences between low and high-resolution pedestrian images by modeling resolution-specific feature discrepancies in feature space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Cross-Resolution ReID methods using super-resolution or joint learning increase complexity and face performance bottlenecks. Resolution differences between surveillance cameras make matching low-resolution with high-resolution images challenging.

Method: Empirically discovered semantic directions indicating resolution differences in ReID feature space. Proposed VPFA framework that models resolution-specific feature discrepancy using vector panning for feature alignment.

Result: Significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks while achieving higher efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed VPFA framework is lightweight, effective, and demonstrates superiority based on the novel finding of resolution-specific semantic directions in ReID feature space.

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfVSR is a novel video super-resolution method that uses an autoregressive one-step diffusion paradigm to efficiently process long videos, achieving state-of-the-art quality with 58x speed-up over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VSR methods face inefficiency and poor scalability when processing long video sequences due to multi-step denoising costs and temporal decomposition artifacts.

Method: Reformulates VSR as autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm, adapts pre-trained DiT into causal structure with rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance, and distills diffusion process into single step with patch-wise pixel supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods like MGLD-VSR, and enables efficient VSR for unbounded-length videos.

Conclusion: InfVSR pushes the frontier of long-form VSR by enabling efficient and scalable processing of extended video sequences while maintaining high quality and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current token-centric T2I architectures struggle with effectively fusing text with visual tokens despite being trained with self-supervision.

Method: Encodes images and captions into discrete tokens, uses joint-embedding predictive Transformer with cross-attention for conditional denoising, injects raw text embeddings before flow matching loss, and performs iterative denoising during inference.

Result: Outperforms non-fusion and late-fusion baselines on ImageNet-1K, demonstrating strong data efficiency and open-vocabulary generalization.

Conclusion: Late architectural fusion combined with objective-level alignment provides an effective balance between conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I systems.

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is

TL;DR: FastForward enables real-time visual localization by creating maps and relocalizing query images in a single feed-forward pass, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with minimal preparation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual localization methods require hours of mapping time even with known camera poses, making them impractical for real-time applications. The goal is to achieve competitive accuracy much faster.

Method: FastForward represents multiple mapping images as 3D-anchored features and uses these to predict image-to-scene correspondences for query images, enabling camera pose estimation in a single feed-forward pass.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with minimal map preparation time and demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

Conclusion: FastForward provides a practical solution for real-time visual localization by significantly reducing mapping time while maintaining competitive accuracy and strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

*Jiamian Wang,Ziqi Zhou,Chaithanya Kumar Mummadi,Sohail Dianat,Majid Rabbani,Raghuveer Rao,Chen Qiu,Zhiqiang Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play refinement module that enhances spatial correspondence in autoregressive vision-language models by jointly refining all generated tokens using global context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models struggle with spatial visual signals due to sequential dependencies in next-token prediction, leading to suboptimal vision-language modeling results.

Method: Proposes a post-pretraining refinement module that operates on all generated tokens simultaneously, leveraging global context and relationships to improve spatial correspondence modeling.

Result: The method improves generation quality and enhances the model's ability to produce semantically consistent results by mitigating error accumulation in sequential generation.

Conclusion: The proposed refinement module effectively addresses spatial correspondence issues in autoregressive vision-language models, improving performance while maintaining the sequential prediction framework.

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

### [85] [SoftCFG: Uncertainty-guided Stable Guidance for Visual autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00996)
*Dongli Xu,Aleksei Tiulpin,Matthew B. Blaschko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SoftCFG is an uncertainty-guided inference method that addresses guidance diminishing and over-guidance issues in autoregressive image generation models by distributing adaptive perturbations across all tokens with certainty weighting and step normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifer-Free Guidance (CFG) in autoregressive models suffers from guidance diminishing (conditional-unconditional gap vanishes during decoding) and over-guidance (strong conditions distort visual coherence), limiting their conditional generation performance.

Method: Proposes SoftCFG with two key components: 1) uncertainty-guided adaptive perturbations distributed across all tokens with certainty weighting, and 2) Step Normalization to bound cumulative perturbations for stable long-sequence generation. The method is training-free and model-agnostic.

Result: SoftCFG significantly improves image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet 256 among autoregressive models.

Conclusion: SoftCFG effectively addresses CFG limitations in AR models through uncertainty-guided adaptive perturbations and step normalization, providing persistent guidance while maintaining visual coherence without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

### [86] [TextCAM: Explaining Class Activation Map with Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01004)
*Qiming Zhao,Xingjian Li,Xiaoyu Cao,Xiaolong Wu,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextCAM enriches Class Activation Mapping (CAM) with natural language explanations by combining spatial localization from CAM with semantic alignment from vision-language models, producing interpretable textual descriptions of visual evidence that support model decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAM methods provide spatial highlighting but lack semantic insight into what visual attributes drive predictions, limiting interpretability and trustworthiness in high-stakes applications.

Method: TextCAM uses CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis to derive channel-level semantic representations, then aggregates them with CAM weights to generate textual descriptions. It also groups feature channels semantically for fine-grained explanations.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB show TextCAM produces faithful and interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

Conclusion: TextCAM successfully bridges the gap between spatial activation maps and semantic understanding, providing more comprehensive explanations that specify both where models attend and what visual attributes support decisions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

### [87] [POVQA: Preference-Optimized Video Question Answering with Rationales for Data Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01009)
*Ashim Dahal,Ankit Ghimire,Saydul Akbar Murad,Nick Rahimi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POVQA introduces a data-efficient pipeline that compresses video into temporally pooled images (1 fps) and aligns LVLMs with lightweight supervision, dramatically improving VQA performance on long videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA methods with large context windows only handle ~50 seconds of video without information loss, which is insufficient for longer video content analysis.

Method: Compress each second of video into single temporally pooled images using motion blur and weighted averaging variants, then fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B with SFT and DPO on ReasonVQA dataset containing 12 movies with human-annotated QA pairs.

Result: Significant performance improvements: F1 score from 0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528. Rationale quality also improved substantially.

Conclusion: The method shows strong robustness across different pooling schemes and maintains gains in zero-shot evaluation on TVQA, demonstrating effective temporal evidence summarization for long video QA.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

*Yuxiang Guo,Jiang Liu,Ze Wang,Hao Chen,Ximeng Sun,Yang Zhao,Jialian Wu,Xiaodong Yu,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageDoctor is a multi-aspect evaluation framework for text-to-image models that assesses image quality across four dimensions and provides pixel-level flaw indicators, outperforming scalar-based reward models by 10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches quantify image quality using a single scalar, limiting comprehensive and interpretable feedback. There's a need for more detailed evaluation methods to support preference alignment in text-to-image models.

Method: Introduces a "look-think-predict" paradigm where the model localizes flaws, generates reasoning, and provides quantitative scores. Built on a vision-language model with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning training.

Result: Demonstrates strong alignment with human preference across multiple datasets and achieves 10% improvement over scalar-based reward models when used for preference tuning.

Conclusion: ImageDoctor provides a comprehensive, interpretable evaluation framework that effectively assesses text-to-image model quality and significantly improves generation quality when used as a reward model.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

### [89] [Towards Adversarial Training under Hyperspectral Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01014)
*Weihua Zhang,Chengze Jiang,Jie Gui,Lu Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces adversarial training to hyperspectral classification and proposes AT-RA, a novel method that enhances robustness against adversarial attacks while preserving spectral semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral classification models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defense methods have limited scalability and effectiveness against strong attacks.

Method: Proposed AT-RA adversarial training method that uses data augmentation to increase spectral diversity and ensure spatial smoothness, preserving spectral semantic information.

Result: AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by 21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50, while increasing benign accuracy by 2.68%.

Conclusion: Adversarial training effectively enhances robustness in hyperspectral classification, and AT-RA successfully addresses unique challenges in hyperspectral data by preserving spectral semantics.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

### [90] [Secure and reversible face anonymization with diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01031)
*Pol Labarbarie,Vincent Itier,William Puech*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First secure, high-quality reversible face anonymization method using diffusion models with secret key mechanism for authorized reversibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current face anonymization methods lack secure reversibility - diffusion models produce high quality but lack key mechanisms, while other methods compromise quality or security.

Method: Combine secret key with latent face representation in diffusion model, use facial mask to preserve identity-irrelevant features, employ deterministic forward/backward diffusion process for reversibility.

Result: Produces high-quality anonymized faces that are less visually similar to originals compared to previous work, while enabling secure reversibility with correct secret key.

Conclusion: Proposed method achieves the first secure, high-quality reversible face anonymization using diffusion models with secret key mechanism, balancing security, quality and reversibility.

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework preserves diffusion characteristics in one-hot space using float-encoded class data and timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss, bridging discriminative and generative learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fundamentally redefine pseudo-discrete diffusion approaches by preserving core diffusion characteristics directly in one-hot space, avoiding reliance on continuous latent spaces or masking policies.

Method: Uses float-encoded one-hot class data as diffusion input, introduces timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss between model outputs and original one-hot labels, creating synergistic design.

Result: Achieves superior performance on classification tasks compared to baseline and exhibits excellent text generation capabilities on image captioning.

Conclusion: ADD framework successfully bridges discriminative and generative learning while validating measurable gains from each component through extensive ablations.

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

*Abdelrhman Werby,Dennis Rotondi,Fabio Scaparro,Kai O. Arras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KeySG is a framework that represents 3D scenes as hierarchical graphs with multi-modal information from keyframes, enabling efficient VLM-based scene understanding and hierarchical RAG for complex query processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene graph approaches are limited to predefined relationships and face scalability issues with large environments that exceed LLM context windows.

Method: Hierarchical graph representation (floors, rooms, objects, functional elements) augmented with multi-modal information from keyframes selected for optimal coverage, using VLM for scene extraction and hierarchical RAG pipeline.

Result: Outperforms prior approaches on most metrics across four benchmarks including 3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval.

Conclusion: KeySG provides superior semantic richness and efficiency for 3D scene understanding and reasoning in complex environments.

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A game-theoretic fusion method called Shapley-credited Context-Aware Dawid-Skene with Agreement improves multi-label understanding of dashcam video by combining multiple VLMs' outputs with contextual priors and reputation states, achieving significant performance gains over single models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in autonomous vehicle stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in safety-critical pipelines, necessitating robust fusion methods.

Method: Proposes a game-theoretic fusion method that learns per-model, per-label, context-conditioned reliabilities from labeled history, converts model reports into agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratios, and combines them with contextual priors and Shapley-based reputation states. Also curates 1,000 real-world dashcam clips and fine-tunes three heterogeneous VLMs with LoRA.

Result: Achieves 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 compared to the best single model, with calibrated, thresholdable posteriors.

Conclusion: VLM fusion serves as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust decision-support component for autonomous vehicle pipelines, effectively amplifying agreement among reliable models while preserving uniquely correct single-model signals.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in
autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in
safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust
decision-support component for AV pipelines.

TL;DR: Code2Video is a code-centric agent framework that generates educational videos through executable Python code using three collaborative agents: Planner, Coder, and Critic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models struggle with professional educational videos that require disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions. A renderable environment controlled via logical commands (code) can better address these requirements.

Method: Three-agent framework: Planner structures lecture content into coherent flows, Coder converts instructions into executable Python code with scope-guided auto-fix, and Critic uses vision-language models with visual anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity.

Result: Code2Video achieves 40% improvement over direct code generation and produces videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials, as evaluated on the MMMC benchmark using VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and the novel TeachQuiz metric.

Conclusion: Code2Video demonstrates potential as a scalable, interpretable, and controllable approach for educational video generation, with code and datasets publicly available.

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct
code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The

TL;DR: EvoWorld is a world model that combines panoramic video generation with evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration, using geometric reprojections from 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human mental exploration and replay of 3D environments, the paper aims to bridge panoramic video generation with evolving 3D memory to achieve spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.

Method: Given a single panoramic image, EvoWorld: 1) generates future video frames using a video generator with view control, 2) evolves 3D scene reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play transformer, and 3) synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric reprojections from the evolving 3D memory.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, particularly excelling in loop-closure detection and spatial coherence over extended trajectories.

Conclusion: EvoWorld represents a significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling by exploiting evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for video generation.

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

*Fei Shen,Weihao Xu,Rui Yan,Dong Zhang,Xiangbo Shu,Jinhui Tang*

TL;DR: IMAGEdit is a training-free framework for editing multiple subjects in videos by manipulating appearances while preserving non-target regions, using multimodal conditioning and mask sequences without finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing video editing methods that struggle with insufficient multimodal conditioning and mask boundary entanglement when handling multiple subjects, enabling more flexible and accurate video subject editing.

Method: Uses a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and prior-based mask retargeting module to generate robust multimodal information and precise mask sequences, then feeds these into a pretrained mask-driven video generation model for synthesis.

Result: Extensive experiments on MSVBench show IMAGEdit consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating strong generalization capability and compatibility with any mask-driven video generation model.

Conclusion: IMAGEdit significantly expands video editing applicability by overcoming key challenges in multi-subject editing and improving overall performance without requiring training or finetuning.

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More

### [98] [Methodological Framework for Quantifying Semantic Test Coverage in RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00001)
*Noah Broestl,Adel Nasser Abdalla,Rajprakash Bale,Hersh Gupta,Max Struever*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A methodology to quantify semantic coverage of RAG test questions against underlying documents using vector embeddings and clustering, helping identify coverage gaps and improve test comprehensiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG evaluation lacks systematic methods to ensure test sets adequately cover the knowledge base, leaving developers with blind spots in system testing.

Method: Embed document chunks and test questions into unified vector space, then calculate coverage metrics (proximity, content-weighted, multi-topic) and use outlier detection to filter irrelevant questions.

Result: Framework effectively quantifies test coverage, identifies underrepresented content areas, and provides recommendations for generating high-value test questions in two distinct use cases.

Conclusion: Provides RAG developers with essential tools to build more robust test suites, improving system reliability and extending to applications like identifying misaligned documents.

Abstract: Reliably determining the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems depends on comprehensive test questions. While a proliferation of
evaluation frameworks for LLM-powered applications exists, current practices
lack a systematic method to ensure these test sets adequately cover the
underlying knowledge base, leaving developers with significant blind spots. To
address this, we present a novel, applied methodology to quantify the semantic
coverage of RAG test questions against their underlying documents. Our approach
leverages existing technologies, including vector embeddings and clustering
algorithms, to create a practical framework for validating test
comprehensiveness. Our methodology embeds document chunks and test questions
into a unified vector space, enabling the calculation of multiple coverage
metrics: basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question
coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate outlier detection to filter irrelevant
questions, allowing for the refinement of test sets. Experimental evidence from
two distinct use cases demonstrates that our framework effectively quantifies
test coverage, identifies specific content areas with inadequate
representation, and provides concrete recommendations for generating new,
high-value test questions. This work provides RAG developers with essential
tools to build more robust test suites, thereby improving system reliability
and extending to applications such as identifying misaligned documents.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TransIP introduces a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials that achieves symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints, using a generic Transformer-based model to learn SO(3)-equivariance through embedding space optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art MLIPs enforce roto-translational symmetries through equivariant neural network architectures, which can lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and scalability. The authors aim to overcome these limitations.

Method: The approach guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space, trained on the Open Molecules (OMol25) collection.

Result: TransIP attains comparable performance to state-of-the-art equivariant baselines in machine-learning force fields. Compared to a data augmentation baseline, it achieves 40% to 60% improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes.

Conclusion: Learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models, demonstrating that symmetry compliance can be achieved without explicit architectural constraints.

Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are
essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material
design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries
through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias
that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and
scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic
Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving
symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach
guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn
SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space.
Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse
molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of
molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and
electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in
machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines.
Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60%
improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly,
our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient
alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.

### [100] [Rethinking RoPE Scaling in Quantized LLM: Theory, Outlier, and Channel-Band Analysis with Weight Rescaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00028)
*Ye Qiao,Haocheng Xu,Xiaofan Zhang,Sitao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q-ROAR is a method that stabilizes RoPE position interpolation for quantized LLMs by grouping RoPE dimensions into frequency bands and performing lightweight search over per-band scales, reducing perplexity by over 14% on long-context tasks without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combining RoPE position interpolation with post-training quantization degrades accuracy due to issues like long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, and outlier shifting, creating position-dependent logit noise.

Method: Q-ROAR groups RoPE dimensions into frequency bands and performs lightweight search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights, guided by interpolation pressure and tail-inflation ratio diagnostics, using a tiny long-context dataset.

Result: Q-ROAR reduces perplexity on long-context workloads by more than 14% while preserving short-context performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM systems.

Conclusion: Q-ROAR provides an effective solution for stabilizing RoPE position interpolation in quantized LLMs without requiring fine-tuning, architecture changes, or additional deployment overhead.

Abstract: Extending the context window support of large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for tasks with long-distance dependencies. RoPE-based interpolation and
extrapolation methods, such as linear scaling and frequency-aware schemes,
enable longer input length support without retraining, while post-training
quantization (PTQ) makes deployment practical. However, we show that combining
RoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled
effects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, anisotropy
from axis-aligned quantizers vs. rotated RoPE pairs, and outlier shifting that
produces position-dependent logit noise. We provide, to the best of our
knowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce
two practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to
phase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long
contexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization,
RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only,
interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE
dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight
search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional
symmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by our
diagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset, requiring no
fine-tuning to the model, no architecture or kernel changes, and no additional
deployment overhead. Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on
long-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context
performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system
stacks.

### [101] [DexBench: Benchmarking LLMs for Personalized Decision Making in Diabetes Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00038)
*Maria Ana Cardei,Josephine Lamp,Mark Derdzinski,Karan Bhatia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DexBench is the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on real-world diabetes management tasks, featuring 360,600 personalized questions across 7 task categories using data from 15,000 individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of specialized benchmarks for patient-facing AI solutions in diabetes care, as prior health benchmarks were either generic, clinician-focused, or limited to clinical tasks like diagnosis and triage.

Method: Created a comprehensive evaluation framework using one month of time-series data from 15,000 individuals across three diabetes populations, generating 360,600 personalized questions across 7 task categories and evaluating models on 5 metrics.

Result: Evaluation of 8 recent LLMs revealed substantial variability across tasks and metrics, with no single model consistently outperforming others across all dimensions.

Conclusion: DexBench aims to advance the reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in diabetes care by establishing this specialized benchmark.

Abstract: We present DexBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language
model (LLM) performance across real-world decision-making tasks faced by
individuals managing diabetes in their daily lives. Unlike prior health
benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical
tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DexBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation
framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI
solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related
domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the
breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic
glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced
decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich
dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces
and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g.,
eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different
diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and
wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized,
contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these
tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and
actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability
across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others
across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the
reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in
diabetes care.

### [102] [Spectral Scaling Laws in Language Models: How Effectively Do Feed-Forward Networks Use Their Latent Space?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00537)
*Nandan Kumar Jha,Brandon Reagen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies spectral utilization in feed-forward networks (FFNs) of large language models, finding asymmetric scaling where soft rank grows linearly with width while hard rank grows sublinearly, suggesting most added capacity goes to low-energy tail directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how effectively large language models utilize their capacity, particularly how FFN components exploit their latent space, which existing scaling laws overlook.

Method: Used a diagnostic suite including Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral Concentration, and Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) to analyze FFNs across LLaMA, GPT-2, and nGPT families.

Result: Found asymmetric spectral scaling: soft rank follows power law with FFN width, while hard rank grows sublinearly with high variance, indicating widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions while dominant-mode subspaces saturate early.

Conclusion: FFN width selection involves a trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, providing guidance for inference-efficient LLM design as much latent space remains under-utilized.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large
they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing
scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit
their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width
selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic
suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral
Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we
quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA,
GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling
law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard
rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests
that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode
subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further
collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space
under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled
trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete
guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.

### [103] [Linear Regression in p-adic metric spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00043)
*Gregory D. Baker,Scott McCallum,Dirk Pattinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes a theoretical foundation for machine learning using p-adic metrics instead of Euclidean metrics, proving that p-adic regression naturally selects actual data points as representatives in hierarchical data structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning uses Euclidean metrics that fail to capture the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships in real-world data.

Method: Developed theoretical framework for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, proving key theorems about p-adic regression and polynomial approximation.

Result: Proved that n-dimensional p-adic regression planes must pass through at least n+1 data points, contrasting with Euclidean regression. Demonstrated practical applications in NLP for hierarchical taxonomies and grammatical morphology.

Conclusion: P-adic metrics are fundamental for properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning, as they naturally respect discrete relationships and select actual observed points as representatives.

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical
data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture
the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a
theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which
naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an
n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a
dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast
to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with
the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of
degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through
at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n
approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will
yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate
the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural
language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical
morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to
properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In
hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than
selecting actual observed points as representatives.

*Abdelrhman Gaber,Hassan Abd-Eltawab,Youssif Abuzied,Muhammad ElMahdy,Tamer ElBatt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedLLM-Align is a federated learning framework that uses pre-trained LLMs as universal feature extractors to handle heterogeneous tabular data across clients, eliminating the need for manual schema harmonization while maintaining privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges with heterogeneous tabular data across clients due to divergent schemas and incompatible feature spaces, which prevent straightforward aggregation in privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare and finance.

Method: Proposes FedLLM-Align framework that serializes tabular records into text and uses pre-trained LLMs (DistilBERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, ClinicalBERT) as universal feature extractors to create semantically aligned representations, enabling lightweight local classifiers under FedAvg protocol.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on coronary heart disease prediction with partitioned Framingham datasets, achieving up to +0.25 improvement in F1-score and 65% reduction in communication cost. Shows graceful degradation under extreme schema divergence.

Conclusion: FedLLM-Align provides a robust, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous environments by leveraging LLMs for semantic feature alignment.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the heterogeneity
of tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible
feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge,
we propose FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that leverages pre-trained large
language models (LLMs) as universal feature extractors. Tabular records are
serialized into text, and embeddings from models such as DistilBERT, ALBERT,
RoBERTa, and ClinicalBERT provide semantically aligned representations that
support lightweight local classifiers under the standard FedAvg protocol. This
approach removes the need for manual schema harmonization while preserving
privacy, since raw data remain strictly local. We evaluate FedLLM-Align on
coronary heart disease prediction using partitioned Framingham datasets with
simulated schema divergence. Across all client settings and LLM backbones, our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to
+0.25 improvement in F1-score and a 65% reduction in communication cost. Stress
testing under extreme schema divergence further demonstrates graceful
degradation, unlike traditional methods that collapse entirely. These results
establish FedLLM-Align as a robust, privacy-preserving, and
communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous
environments.

*Sicong Liu,Weiye Wu,Xiangrui Xu,Teng Li,Bowen Pang,Bin Guo,Zhiwen Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This survey systematically analyzes adaptive, resource-efficient agentic AI systems that use foundation models as cognitive cores, addressing the tension between FM complexity and deployment constraints in mobile/edge environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The convergence of foundation models and AI agents creates opportunities for autonomous systems, but faces fundamental tension between growing FM complexity and limited resources in mobile/edge deployments (memory, energy, bandwidth, latency).

Method: Systematic characterization of enabling techniques including elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and agentic AI applications. Mapping of FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources.

Result: Established a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and resource-efficient agentic AI. Identified key techniques and categorized them into four main areas for enabling efficient deployment.

Conclusion: The survey provides foundational understanding of connections between enabling technologies and promotes further discussion on fusing agentic intelligence with intelligent agents, highlighting future opportunities in algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge deployment.

Abstract: Foundation models have reshaped AI by unifying fragmented architectures into
scalable backbones with multimodal reasoning and contextual adaptation. In
parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the
sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their
cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy,
generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by
real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants,
and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge
computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that
together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with
reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time
interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy,
bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing
complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This
survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive,
resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into
elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and
agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing
accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under
distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in
algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge
deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this
work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and
resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to
understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting
further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent
agents.

### [106] [Approximately Unimodal Likelihood Models for Ordinal Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00122)
*Ryoya Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes approximately unimodal likelihood models for ordinal regression that can represent both unimodal and near-unimodal conditional probability distributions, addressing limitations of strict unimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world ordinal data show unimodal conditional probability distributions, but some values of explanatory variables produce non-unimodal distributions, causing bias in strict unimodal models.

Method: Developed approximately unimodal likelihood models that can represent up to unimodal CPDs and CPDs close to unimodal, providing more flexibility than strict unimodal models.

Result: Experimental verification shows the proposed model is effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and ordinal regression tasks.

Conclusion: Approximately unimodal likelihood models offer a better balance between capturing the natural unimodal tendency in ordinal data while accommodating non-unimodal cases, improving ordinal regression performance.

Abstract: Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification
of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and
considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory
variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure `natural
ordinal relation' common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into
the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world
ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution
(CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will
often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood
models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it
was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have
values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be
non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for
such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose
approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal
CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that
a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and
OR tasks.

TL;DR: BigBang-Proton is a unified sequence-based architecture for scientific multi-task learning that achieves state-of-the-art performance across various scientific domains while maintaining multitask capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a scientific multi-task learner that can handle cross-scale, cross-structure, cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks through language-guided scientific computing, aiming to match or exceed task-specific scientific models.

Method: Uses Theory-Experiment Learning paradigm to align numerical data with text, Binary Patch Encoding instead of BPE tokenization, and Monte Carlo Attention instead of traditional transformers. Pretrained on cross-discipline scientific datasets mixed with general corpus via next-word-prediction.

Result: Achieves 100% accuracy in 50-digit arithmetic, matches specialized models in particle physics jet tagging, equals MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction, and exceeds benchmarks in genome modeling.

Conclusion: Language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning capabilities, with plans to scale to universe-scale pretraining as a step toward material world foundational model.

Abstract: We introduce BigBang-Proton, a unified sequence-based architecture for
auto-regressive language modeling pretrained on cross-scale, cross-structure,
cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks to construct a scientific
multi-task learner. BigBang-Proton incorporates three fundamental innovations
compared to mainstream general-purpose LLMs: Theory-Experiment Learning
paradigm aligns large-scale numerical experimental data with theoretical text
corpora; Binary Patch Encoding replaces byte pair encoding(BPE) tokenization;
Monte Carlo Attention substitutes traditional transformer architectures.
Through next-word-prediction pretraining on cross-discipline scientific
datasets of real-world problems mixed with general textual corpus, followed by
fine-tuning and inference on downstream tasks, BigBang-Proton demonstrates
100\% accuracy in up to 50-digit arithmetic addition operations, performance on
par with leading specialized models in particle physics jet tagging, matching
MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, performance
comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction,
and benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling. These results prove
that language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed the performance
of task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning
capabilities. We further hypothesize to scale the pretraining to the universe
scale as a fundamental step toward developing material world foundational
model.

### [108] [Large Language Models Inference Engines based on Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00133)
*Adarsha Balaji,Sandeep Madireddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes NeurTransformer, a method to convert transformer models to spiking neural networks (SNNs) for improved energy efficiency while maintaining performance, addressing quadratic complexity issues in traditional transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models have quadratic time/space complexity with input sequence length, making training and deployment computationally expensive. SNNs offer energy efficiency but face challenges in training large-scale models and achieving low latency.

Method: Three-step approach: (1) Replace self-attention with spike-based self-attention (SSA), (2) Convert feed-forward blocks to SNN equivalents, (3) Fine-tune SSA using SNN surrogate learning algorithms. Tested on GPT-2 variants of increasing size.

Result: Converted GPT-2 small models show 5-12% loss in cosine similarity and 9.7% reduction in perplexity. SSA block achieves 64.71%-85.28% reduction in estimated energy consumption compared to traditional self-attention on digital hardware.

Conclusion: NeurTransformer provides an effective methodology for creating energy-efficient transformer-based SNNs while maintaining reasonable performance, offering a scalable solution to computational challenges in large transformer models.

Abstract: Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the
state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas
such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these
models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a
quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring
efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these
limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks
(SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs,
using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On
the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to
their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes
at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To
address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing
transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach
with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1)
replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA),
(2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its
equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate
learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its
accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing
model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a
5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we
demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block
and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption
when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.

*Yujia Zheng,Shaoan Xie,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a theoretical framework for concept identifiability through comparison of diverse observations, extending human cognitive mechanisms to machine learning with correctness guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide theoretical support for concept learning by leveraging the human cognitive mechanism of comparison, which enables compositional understanding and extrapolation without assuming specific concept types or parametric models.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework for concept identifiability using multiple classes of observations, showing that sufficient diversity across classes allows hidden concepts to be identified nonparametrically, with local comparison guarantees when global conditions aren't met.

Result: Hidden concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional relations, or parametric generative models when sufficient diversity exists across observation classes, and hidden structures between classes and concepts can also be identified nonparametrically.

Conclusion: The comparison mechanism provides theoretical guarantees for concept identifiability in machine learning, extending human cognitive principles to achieve correctness guarantees and flexible applicability across various scenarios.

Abstract: We are born with the ability to learn concepts by comparing diverse
observations. This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional
manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple
concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison,
fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true
concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field
of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still
lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a
theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes
of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden
concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional
relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions
are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as
many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the
applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden
structure between classes and concepts can also be identified
nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and
real-world settings.

### [110] [Which Rewards Matter? Reward Selection for Reinforcement Learning under Limited Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00144)
*Shreyas Chaudhari,Renhao Zhang,Philip S. Thomas,Bruno Castro da Silva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes reward selection for reinforcement learning with limited feedback (RLLF), investigating strategies to select which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance when only a fraction of samples get rewards labeled.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical reinforcement learning problems often face computational/financial constraints in obtaining large quantities of reward labels, especially when relying on human feedback, creating a need for effective reward selection strategies.

Method: Two types of selection strategies: (i) heuristics using reward-free information like state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii) strategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback.

Result: Critical reward subsets guide agents along optimal trajectories and support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after deviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision.

Conclusion: Reward selection is established as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in feedback-limited settings.

Abstract: The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn effective policies
is determined by the rewards available during training. However, for practical
problems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due
to computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human
feedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback --
only a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question
arises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We
formalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from
limited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates
the study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection
strategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free
information such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)
strategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that
critical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal
trajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after
deviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with
significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward
selection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in
feedback-limited settings.

### [111] [Partial Identification Approach to Counterfactual Fairness Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00163)
*Saeyoung Rho,Junzhe Zhang,Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating counterfactual fairness measures when they are not identifiable from observational data, using partial identification to derive informative bounds on these measures with a Bayesian approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of AI decision-making systems in critical domains like criminal justice and hiring has raised fairness concerns. Since we often only have access to algorithm outputs without internal mechanisms, researchers examine how decisions change when sensitive attributes (like race) change, leading to counterfactual fairness measures that are challenging to evaluate from available data.

Method: The paper uses partial identification to derive informative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational data, introducing a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness measures with high confidence.

Result: The algorithm was demonstrated on the COMPAS dataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race, age, and sex. Results showed a positive (spurious) effect on COMPAS score when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative (direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian partial identification approach provides a practical solution for evaluating counterfactual fairness measures when they are not identifiable from observational data, revealing important fairness implications in real-world systems like COMPAS.

Abstract: The wide adoption of AI decision-making systems in critical domains such as
criminal justice, loan approval, and hiring processes has heightened concerns
about algorithmic fairness. As we often only have access to the output of
algorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to
examine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as
race) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual
fairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains
a challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual
measure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the
combination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge. This paper
addresses this challenge using partial identification, which derives
informative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational
data. We introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness
measures with high confidence. We demonstrate our algorithm on the COMPAS
dataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race,
age, and sex. Our results reveal a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS
score when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative
(direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age.

### [112] [Why Can't Transformers Learn Multiplication? Reverse-Engineering Reveals Long-Range Dependency Pitfalls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00184)
*Xiaoyan Bai,Itamar Pres,Yuntian Deng,Chenhao Tan,Stuart Shieber,Fernanda Viégas,Martin Wattenberg,Andrew Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Language models fail at multi-digit multiplication due to lack of long-range dependencies. A model with implicit chain-of-thought successfully learns it by encoding dependencies through attention mechanisms and Fourier-based digit representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why capable language models fail at simple multi-digit multiplication tasks, and to reverse-engineer the mechanisms that enable successful learning of this operation.

Method: Reverse-engineering a model that learns multiplication via implicit chain-of-thought, using logit attributions, linear probes, and analyzing attention mechanisms. Also introduced an auxiliary loss for predicting running sums.

Result: Found that successful models encode long-range dependencies using attention to create directed acyclic graphs for caching/retrieving partial products, implement partial products via Minkowski sums and Fourier basis digit representations, while standard fine-tuning converges to suboptimal local minima.

Conclusion: The study reveals a pitfall in learning long-range dependencies in Transformers and demonstrates how appropriate inductive biases can address this issue, providing insights into model mechanisms for arithmetic operations.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly
simple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by
reverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via
\emph{implicit chain-of-thought}, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of
long-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the
model encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit
multiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using
attention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''
pairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products
in attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and
digits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and
efficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these
insights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find
that the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range
dependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an
auxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe,
which provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn
multi-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms
of an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning
long-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the
correct inductive bias can address this issue.

*Xin Yu,Cong Xie,Ziyu Zhao,Tiantian Fan,Lingzhou Xue,Zhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PrunedLoRA is a new framework that uses structured pruning to create more expressive low-rank adapters from over-parameterized spaces, outperforming standard LoRA and its variants across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA's representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning, and there's a need to obtain more expressive low-rank adapters from over-parameterized spaces.

Method: PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes less important components during fine-tuning using gradient-based structured pruning, preventing their reactivation and enabling flexible rank allocation. It minimizes pruning error for overall loss with fine-grained pruning and recovery updates.

Result: Empirically outperforms LoRA and its variants across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding tasks, and shows advantages over existing structured pruning methods across diverse sparsity levels.

Conclusion: PrunedLoRA provides a theoretically robust and practically effective approach for creating more expressive low-rank adapters, with proven robustness advantages of gradient-based pruning over activation-based pruning under weight perturbation.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its
representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the
context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank
adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new
framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative
low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior
approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes
less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation,
enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by
minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning
and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded
interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of
structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight
perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based
pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding,
and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods
across diverse sparsity levels.

*Prasanna Parthasarathi,Mathieu Reymond,Boxing Chen,Yufei Cui,Sarath Chandar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO-λ is a novel extension to GRPO that improves credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for complex reasoning tasks using λ-return approximation and eligibility traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods like GRPO lack explicit reward or critic models, limiting their ability to assign fine-grained credit across token sequences in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Approximates learning from λ-return with reformulated eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities and a novel critic-free approximation of temporal-difference error, with variations for λ-return weighting.

Result: 30-40% improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5 architectures, with over 3 points average performance improvement on math reasoning benchmarks and 4.5 points improvement on 7B model.

Conclusion: GRPO-λ significantly enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning, providing substantial performance gains over GRPO across multiple math reasoning datasets and model architectures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring
complex reasoning, prompting significant interest in improving their reasoning
abilities through post-training. Especially RL based methods using verifiable
reward, like the state-of-the-art GRPO, have shown to tremendously improve
reasoning behaviors when applied as post-training methods. However, the lack of
an explicit reward or critic model limits GRPO's ability to assign fine-grained
credit across token sequences. In this work, we present GRPO-$\lambda$, a novel
extension to GRPO that enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for
complex reasoning tasks. We approximate learning from $\lambda$-return with a
reformulation of eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities applied
after each sequence generation, and a novel critic-free approximation of the
temporal-difference error. We introduce a few variations for the weighting of
the $\lambda$-return, and their applications to the eligibility-trace, where
all the variations provide significant gains over GRPO. We compare
GRPO-$\lambda$ against GRPO by training models from 1.5B to 7B parameters on
$4$ different math reasoning datasets. The training plots demonstrate 30-40%
improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5
architectures. Finally, we show that with GRPO-$\lambda$, the resulting average
performance on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC improves
over GRPO by over $3$ points and a $4.5$ points improvement on the 7B model.

TL;DR: RouterArena is the first open platform for comprehensive comparison of LLM routers, featuring a standardized dataset, difficulty levels, evaluation metrics, and automated leaderboard updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid emergence of various LLM routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging, similar to the need for model leaderboards.

Method: RouterArena provides a principally constructed dataset with broad knowledge domain coverage, distinguishable difficulty levels, extensive evaluation metrics, and an automated framework for leaderboard updates.

Result: The initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison has been produced using the framework.

Conclusion: RouterArena will be made open to the public to enable comprehensive router comparison and standardized evaluation.

Abstract: Today's LLM ecosystem comprises a wide spectrum of models that differ in
size, capability, and cost. No single model is optimal for all scenarios;
hence, LLM routers have become essential for selecting the most appropriate
model under varying circumstances. However, the rapid emergence of various
routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging. To address this
problem, we need a comprehensive router comparison and a standardized
leaderboard, similar to those available for models. In this work, we introduce
RouterArena, the first open platform enabling comprehensive comparison of LLM
routers. RouterArena has (1) a principally constructed dataset with broad
knowledge domain coverage, (2) distinguishable difficulty levels for each
domain, (3) an extensive list of evaluation metrics, and (4) an automated
framework for leaderboard updates. Leveraging our framework, we have produced
the initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1.
We will make our platform open to the public soon.

TL;DR: A novel geometric scattering transform for graphs with scalar and vector node features that is SE(3)-equivariant and achieves comparable performance to other equivariant GNNs with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a geometric scattering transform that maintains equivariance with respect to rigid-body roto-translations (SE(3)) for geometric graphs containing both scalar and vector node features.

Method: Introduce a novel geometric scattering transform that is SE(3)-equivariant and can be incorporated into geometric graph neural network (GNN) frameworks.

Result: The equivariant scattering-based GNN achieves comparable performance to other equivariant message-passing-based GNNs while using significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed geometric scattering transform provides an effective and parameter-efficient approach for handling geometric graphs with SE(3) symmetry requirements.

Abstract: We introduce a novel version of the geometric scattering transform for
geometric graphs containing scalar and vector node features. This new
scattering transform has desirable symmetries with respect to rigid-body
roto-translations (i.e., $SE(3)$-equivariance) and may be incorporated into a
geometric GNN framework. We empirically show that our equivariant
scattering-based GNN achieves comparable performance to other equivariant
message-passing-based GNNs at a fraction of the parameter count.

*Zhanda Zhu,Qidong Su,Yaoyao Ding,Kevin Song,Shang Wang,Gennady Pekhimenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRAFusion is an efficient LoRA fine-tuning system that addresses memory access inefficiencies and enables concurrent multi-adapter training through kernel-level fusion and adaptive scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA systems have two key inefficiencies: substantial runtime overhead from redundant memory accesses on large activations, and inability to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA adapters that share the same base model.

Method: LoRAFusion uses kernel-level graph-splitting to fuse memory-bound operations, eliminating unnecessary memory accesses while preserving compute-bound GEMM performance. At scheduling level, it introduces adaptive batching for multi-job fine-tuning with group splitting and bin-packing for balanced microbatches.

Result: Achieves up to 1.96x (1.47x average) end-to-end speedup vs Megatron-LM, and up to 1.46x (1.29x average) improvement over mLoRA. Fused kernel achieves up to 1.39x (1.27x average) performance improvement.

Conclusion: LoRAFusion provides significant performance improvements for LoRA fine-tuning through efficient kernel fusion and multi-adapter scheduling, serving as a plug-and-play replacement for existing systems.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the leading Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), as it significantly
reduces GPU memory usage while maintaining competitive fine-tuned model quality
on downstream tasks. Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies
in existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime
overhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second,
they miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA
adapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to
missed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication
overlap, and improved GPU load balance.
  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA
fine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting
method that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary
memory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without
incurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling
level, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job
fine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger
batch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each
group to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches. LoRAFusion achieves
up to $1.96\times$ ($1.47\times$ on average) end-to-end speedup compared to
Megatron-LM, and up to $1.46\times$ ($1.29\times$ on average) improvement over
mLoRA, the state-of-the-art multi-LoRA fine-tuning system. Our fused kernel
achieves up to $1.39\times$ ($1.27\times$ on average) kernel performance
improvement and can directly serve as a plug-and-play replacement in existing
LoRA systems. We open-source LoRAFusion at
https://github.com/CentML/lorafusion.

TL;DR: Weight normalization with Riemannian optimization achieves linear convergence and exponential speedup over standard methods in overparameterized matrix sensing, with both iteration and sample complexity improving polynomially with overparameterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning but their theoretical understanding remains limited, particularly regarding how weight normalization leverages overparameterization for faster convergence.

Method: Apply generalized weight normalization with Riemannian optimization to the overparameterized matrix sensing problem.

Result: Proven linear convergence with exponential speedup over standard methods; both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as overparameterization increases.

Conclusion: This work provides the first characterization of how weight normalization leverages overparameterization for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

Abstract: While normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning, their
theoretical understanding remains relatively limited. In this work, we
establish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to
the overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian
optimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over
standard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that
both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of
overparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work
provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization
for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

TL;DR: Directed-MAML is a novel meta-RL algorithm that addresses MAML's computational inefficiency by using task-directed approximation before second-order gradient steps, improving convergence speed and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAML faces challenges in meta-RL due to second-order gradient computations causing high computational/memory overhead and complex nested optimization that hinders convergence to global optimum.

Method: Directed-MAML applies an additional first-order task-directed approximation before the second-order gradient step to estimate second-order gradient effects, accelerating convergence and reducing computational cost.

Result: Experimental results show Directed-MAML outperforms MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence speed across CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2, and two-vehicle intersection crossing scenarios.

Conclusion: Task-directed approximation can be effectively integrated into other meta-learning algorithms like FOMAML and Meta-SGD, yielding improved computational efficiency and convergence speed.

Abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a versatile meta-learning framework
applicable to both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying MAML to meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) presents
notable challenges. First, MAML relies on second-order gradient computations,
leading to significant computational and memory overhead. Second, the nested
structure of optimization increases the problem's complexity, making
convergence to a global optimum more challenging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Directed-MAML, a novel task-directed meta-RL algorithm.
Before the second-order gradient step, Directed-MAML applies an additional
first-order task-directed approximation to estimate the effect of second-order
gradients, thereby accelerating convergence to the optimum and reducing
computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that Directed-MAML
surpasses MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence
speed in the scenarios of CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2 and two-vehicle
intersection crossing. Furthermore, we show that task-directed approximation
can be effectively integrated into other meta-learning algorithms, such as
First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FOMAML) and Meta Stochastic Gradient
Descent(Meta-SGD), yielding improved computational efficiency and convergence
speed.

TL;DR: Thoughtbubbles is a transformer variant that enables parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete residual streams, allowing tokens requiring more computation to form "bubbles" for additional thinking during pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for scaling inference-time compute rely on explicit chain-of-thought tokens, which are limited to serial natural-language verbalization and cannot be applied during pretraining.

Method: Thoughtbubbles learns to fork or delete residual streams during pretraining with only language modeling loss, enabling tokens to form "bubbles" of cloned residuals for parallel adaptive computation in latent space.

Result: Outperforms standard decoder LMs and non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o perplexity, and in zero-shot evaluations like HellaSwag and LAMBADA across 150M to 772M parameter scales.

Conclusion: The implicit nature of Thoughtbubbles enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time, unifying train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on
training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an
answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot
be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated,
natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work,
we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs
parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete
residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can
form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional
thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only
language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as
well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o
perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after
pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our
method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time,
paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

*Alex Chen,Renato Geh,Aditya Grover,Guy Van den Broeck,Daniel Israel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KV cache compression can cause certain instructions to be ignored by LLMs, particularly in multi-instruction scenarios, with system prompt leakage as a key example.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the under-explored consequences of KV cache compression in realistic multi-instruction scenarios and identify pitfalls that practitioners should be aware of.

Method: Analyzed factors affecting prompt leakage including compression method, instruction order, and KV eviction bias, then proposed modified KV cache eviction policies.

Result: Found that certain instructions degrade rapidly with compression, effectively being ignored by LLMs, and identified key factors contributing to system prompt leakage.

Conclusion: Simple changes to KV cache eviction policies can mitigate the negative impacts of compression and improve performance in multi-instruction tasks.

Abstract: KV cache compression promises increased throughput and efficiency with
negligible loss in performance. While the gains in throughput are indisputable
and recent literature has indeed shown minimal degradation on particular
benchmarks, in general the consequences of compression in realistic scenarios
such as multi-instruction prompting have been insufficiently studied. In this
paper, we identify several pitfalls practitioners should be aware of when
deploying KV cache compressed LLMs. Importantly, we show that certain
instructions degrade much more rapidly with compression, effectively causing
them to be completely ignored by the LLM. As a practical example of that, we
highlight system prompt leakage as a case study, empirically showing the impact
of compression on leakage and general instruction following. We show several
factors that play a role in prompt leakage: compression method, instruction
order, and KV eviction bias. We then propose simple changes to KV cache
eviction policies that can reduce the impact of these factors and improve the
overall performance in multi-instruction tasks.

TL;DR: DIANO is a deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that creates physically interpretable latent spaces for dimensional and geometric reduction, with built-in PDE enforcement for embedding physical priors into latent dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving interpretability in latent spaces for scientific machine learning, particularly in high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data analysis.

Method: Uses encoding and decoding neural operators for spatial coarsening and refinement, integrates a differentiable PDE solver in the latent space, and tests on various PDE formulations including 2D advection-diffusion and 3D Pressure-Poisson equations.

Result: DIANO successfully constructs interpretable latent spaces that facilitate both dimensional and geometrical reduction while enabling PDE solving, as demonstrated on benchmark problems including flow past a 2D cylinder and 3D patient-specific coronary artery.

Conclusion: The framework provides physically interpretable latent representations for scientific machine learning applications, allowing integration of governing equations directly within compressed latent spaces.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning has enabled the extraction of physical insights
from high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data using linear and nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite these advances, achieving
interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this,
we propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a
deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically
interpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with
the provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the
latent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional
input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening
through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original
inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess
DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality
reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator
and standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial
differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the
latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity
PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further
investigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady
advection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their
influence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems
considered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric
stenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery. These case studies
demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that
facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent
interpretability.

*Vincent Roulet,Atish Agarwala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces efficient methods for computing per-example gradient statistics in deep learning, challenging the assumption that this is prohibitively expensive. It shows how gradient statistics can be implemented with minimal overhead using AD graph surgery and JAX's vectorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning algorithms treat mini-batches as single objects by averaging gradients, but computing per-example gradient statistics could enable better algorithm design and analysis. The motivation is to demonstrate that this is computationally feasible and to explore its benefits.

Method: The authors use automatic differentiation graph surgery to compute gradient statistics efficiently, with minimal computational and memory overhead. They also leverage JAX's vectorization transformation for prototyping. They analyze signSGD and Adam preconditioner variations through per-example gradient transformations.

Result: The paper shows that optimal placement of sign operations in signSGD is crucial and predictable via signal-to-noise ratio. For Adam, optimization performs better when the preconditioner is dominated by gradient mean rather than variance, contrary to conventional wisdom.

Conclusion: Per-example gradient information enables new analyses and algorithm design possibilities, demonstrating that computing gradient statistics beyond averages is feasible and beneficial for optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Training algorithms in deep learning usually treat a mini-batch of samples as
a single object; they average gradients over the mini-batch, and then process
the average in various ways. Computing other statistics beyond the average may
have been seen as prohibitively resource intensive in automatic differentiation
(AD) frameworks. We show that this is not the case. Generally, gradient
statistics can be implemented through a surgery of the AD graph, which, in some
cases, incur almost no computational and memory overheads compared to the
mini-batch gradient computation. Additionally, we show that in certain classes
of models, including transformers, JAX's vectorization transformation offers a
viable implementation for prototyping and experimentation. We then revise our
understanding of two nonlinear operations in optimization through the lens of
per-example gradient transformations. We first study signSGD and show that the
optimal placement of the sign operation in the gradient processing chain is
crucial to success and can be predicted with a simple signal-to-noise ratio
argument. Next we study per-example variations of the Adam preconditioner, and
show that optimization is best served when the preconditioner is dominated by
the mean rather than the variance of the gradient distribution - in contrast to
conventional wisdom. Overall we demonstrate that per-example gradient
information enables new analyses and possibilities for algorithm design.

*Xiaofeng Lin,Hejian Sang,Zhipeng Wang,Xuezhou Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SFT can achieve strong generalization comparable to RL when trained with prompt diversity and chain-of-thought supervision, challenging the view that SFT inherently memorizes data while RL generalizes better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing view that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training data and fails to generalize, while reinforcement learning (RL) attains broader robustness.

Method: Systematic evaluation on Sokoban and General Points benchmarks using SFT with prompt diversity during training and chain-of-thought supervision for harder tasks.

Result: SFT with prompt diversity achieves strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming in-distribution performance. Chain-of-thought supervision improves transfer to more difficult regimes. Combined approach matches or surpasses RL baselines.

Conclusion: SFT can generalize as strongly as RL with appropriately curated demonstrations, challenging the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL.

Abstract: A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training
data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains
broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on
two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a
different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from
frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT
models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones.
Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields
strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming
in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can
generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more
difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and
arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that
increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT
achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both
instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL
baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability.
These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL
and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated
demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL. Code reproducing

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Automated optimization of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for microscopy data using reward-based strategies and Gaussian Mixture Models to find optimal low-dimensional representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microscopy generates complex image data that needs simpler, interpretable representations to reveal underlying physical structures, but VAE performance depends on design choices typically optimized through trial-and-error.

Method: Used reward-based strategies with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) to evaluate latent space representations, tested on Piezoresponse Force Microscopy data.

Result: GMM and BGMM approximations provide strong basis for constructing reward functions that can estimate model efficiency and guide search for optimal parsimonious representations.

Conclusion: Reward-based strategies with GMM/BGMM enable automated and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows for finding optimal low-dimensional representations of complex microscopy data.

Abstract: Microscopy techniques generate vast amounts of complex image data that in
principle can be used to discover simpler, interpretable, and parsimonious
forms to reveal the underlying physical structures, such as elementary building
blocks in molecular systems or order parameters and phases in crystalline
materials. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a powerful means of
constructing such low-dimensional representations, but their performance
heavily depends on multiple non-myopic design choices, which are often
optimized through trial-and-error and empirical analysis. To enable automated
and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows, we investigated reward-based
strategies for evaluating latent space representations. Using Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy data as a model system, we examined multiple policies and
reward functions that can serve as a foundation for automated optimization. Our
analysis shows that approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) provides a strong basis for
constructing reward functions capable of estimating model efficiency and
guiding the search for optimal parsimonious representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Coded-smoothing module integrates into training pipelines to regularize learning and improve generalization, and into inference for enhanced adversarial robustness, inspired by coded computing principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient regularization mechanism that improves generalization and adversarial robustness in machine learning models with minimal computational overhead.

Method: Adapt coded computing principles to ML by processing linear combinations of data rather than raw inputs, creating a module that can be integrated into both training (supervised/unsupervised) and inference pipelines.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent improvement in generalization and state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks across supervised and unsupervised tasks.

Conclusion: Coded-smoothing provides an effective and efficient approach to enhance both generalization and adversarial robustness in machine learning models through coded computing-inspired regularization.

Abstract: We introduce the coded-smoothing module, which can be seamlessly integrated
into standard training pipelines, both supervised and unsupervised, to
regularize learning and improve generalization with minimal computational
overhead. In addition, it can be incorporated into the inference pipeline to
randomize the model and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations.
The design of coded-smoothing is inspired by general coded computing, a
paradigm originally developed to mitigate straggler and adversarial failures in
distributed computing by processing linear combinations of the data rather than
the raw inputs. Building on this principle, we adapt coded computing to machine
learning by designing an efficient and effective regularization mechanism that
encourages smoother representations and more generalizable solutions. Extensive
experiments on both supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that
coded-smoothing consistently improves generalization and achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

*Buu Phan,Reza Ebrahimi,Sanjay Haresh,Roland Memisevic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid models combining recurrent and attention components struggle with length generalization due to Transformer shortcuts, but delaying attention layer training enables near-perfect accuracy on sequences 3x longer than training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurrent networks handle state tracking well but struggle with recall, while Transformers excel at recall but fail to extend state-tracking to longer sequences. The complementary strengths motivate hybrid architectures.

Method: Construct hybrid models integrating recurrent and attention-based components, and propose delaying training of attention layers to mitigate Transformer shortcut exploitation.

Result: Without delayed training, hybrids show poor length generalization due to Transformer shortcuts. With delayed training, models achieve >90% accuracy on sequences 3x longer than training sequences.

Conclusion: Delaying attention layer training is an effective strategy that enables hybrid models to preserve both state tracking and associative recall capabilities while achieving strong length generalization.

Abstract: We study length generalization in sequence models on a composite problem
involving both state tracking and associative recall. Prior work finds that
recurrent networks handle state tracking well but struggle with recall, whereas
Transformers excel at recall yet fail to extend state-tracking capabilities to
longer sequences. Motivated by the complementary strengths of these
architectures, we construct hybrid models integrating recurrent and
attention-based components, and train them on the combined task to evaluate
whether both capabilities can be preserved. Our results reveal that, in such
hybrids, the Transformer component tends to exploit shortcut solutions, leading
to poor length generalization. We identify this shortcut reliance as a key
obstacle and propose a simple yet effective training strategy -- delaying the
training of the attention layers -- that mitigates this effect and
significantly improves length generalization performance. Our experiments show
that this approach enables hybrid models to achieve near-perfect accuracy
($>90\%$) on hybrid sequences three times longer than those used during
training.

### [128] [Learning Energy-based Variational Latent Prior for VAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00260)
*Debottam Dutta,Chaitanya Amballa,Zhongweiyang Xu,Yu-Lin Wei,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes EVaLP, an energy-based variational latent prior for VAEs that addresses the "prior hole" problem by modeling the prior as an energy-based model with variational approximation, enabling both flexible posterior matching and fast sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAEs generate blurry samples due to the "prior hole" problem - regions with high prior probability but low posterior probability. There's a tradeoff between having a flexible prior that matches the posterior and maintaining fast sampling capability.

Method: Model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM) with variational approximation to handle the normalization constant, avoiding expensive MCMC. Use a sampler network for approximation and formulate training as alternating optimization. The sampler serves as implicit variational prior during generation.

Result: EVaLP shows improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior holes, and better sampling efficiency compared to multiple state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed energy-based variational latent prior successfully addresses the prior hole problem in VAEs while maintaining efficient sampling, offering a better balance between flexibility and generation speed.

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and
inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior
hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low
probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,
high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the
posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be
flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate
samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper
proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are
known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the
ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency
on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the
normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.
The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show
that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating
optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit
variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We
compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple
SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior
holes, and better sampling efficiency.

*Trung Hoang Le,Tran Cao Son,Huiping Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLogic introduces query-dependent scoring for logical rules in knowledge graph completion, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by dynamically assessing rule importance based on local subgraph context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current logical rule-based methods treat rules as universal with fixed confidence scores, ignoring that rule importance varies depending on the specific query context, which limits their effectiveness.

Method: SLogic uses a scoring function that leverages the subgraph centered on a query's head entity to dynamically assign query-dependent scores to logical rules, allowing context-aware rule evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including both embedding-based and rule-based methods.

Conclusion: By incorporating local subgraph context to dynamically assess rule importance, SLogic provides a more effective and context-aware approach to knowledge graph completion using logical rules.

Abstract: Logical rule-based methods offer an interpretable approach to knowledge graph
completion by capturing compositional relationships in the form of
human-readable inference rules. However, current approaches typically treat
logical rules as universal, assigning each rule a fixed confidence score that
ignores query-specific context. This is a significant limitation, as a rule's
importance can vary depending on the query. To address this, we introduce
SLogic (Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule learning), a novel framework that
assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules. The core of SLogic is a
scoring function that utilizes the subgraph centered on a query's head entity,
allowing the significance of each rule to be assessed dynamically. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that by leveraging local subgraph
context, SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including
both embedding-based and rule-based methods.

*Shutong Wu,Jiawei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Freedave is a novel fast sampling algorithm for Diffusion Large Language Models that enables lossless parallel decoding, boosting inference throughput up to 2.8× without performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLLMs have bidirectional attention advantages but suffer from poor inference efficiency due to incompatibility with KV Cache, while existing parallel decoding methods cause performance degradation.

Method: A pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification that guarantees reproduction of sequences from static sampling without extra model forward calls.

Result: Achieved up to 2.8× throughput boost on math reasoning tasks with no performance degradation compared to standard sampling.

Conclusion: Freedave successfully overcomes DLLM inference efficiency limitations while maintaining performance, making DLLMs more practical for deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of
language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their
bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the
connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the
famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However,
this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently
compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not
competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their
inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding
algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible
performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free
Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for
DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a
pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is
guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without
introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of
DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math
reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: ACT-ViT is a Vision Transformer-inspired model that treats LLM activation tensors as images to detect hallucinations, outperforming traditional probing methods while supporting multi-LLM training and transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current probing classifiers for detecting hallucinations in LLM-generated text are limited by operating on isolated layer-token pairs and being LLM-specific, which reduces their effectiveness and prevents cross-LLM applications.

Method: Treat full activation tensors (layers × tokens) as images and design ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can process activation tensors efficiently and supports training on data from multiple LLMs simultaneously.

Result: ACT-ViT consistently outperforms traditional probing techniques, benefits substantially from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen datasets, and can be effectively transferred to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed ACT-ViT approach effectively addresses limitations of existing hallucination detection methods by leveraging the sequential structure of activation data and enabling cross-LLM applications through its flexible architecture.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial
for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate
on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their
effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce
a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural
sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens)
and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design
ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and
efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from
multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing
diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms
traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for
deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially
from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen
datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models struggle in non-stationary environments due to loss of plasticity - the degradation of their ability to learn new information over time, which limits their applicability in continual learning scenarios.

Method: Grounded in dynamical systems theory, the study formally defines LoP by identifying stable manifolds in parameter space that trap gradient trajectories. Analysis reveals two primary mechanisms: frozen units from activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational redundancy.

Result: The framework reveals a fundamental tension: properties that promote generalization in static settings (low-rank representations, simplicity biases) directly contribute to LoP in continual learning. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical foundations for understanding LoP and explores architectural choices or targeted perturbations as potential mitigation strategies to maintain learning plasticity in non-stationary environments.

Abstract: Deep learning models excel in stationary data but struggle in non-stationary

reveals two primary mechanisms that create these traps: frozen units from

redundancy. Our framework uncovers a fundamental tension: properties that
promote generalization in static settings, such as low-rank representations and
simplicity biases, directly contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios.
We validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations and explore

*Zhongxuan Liu,Yue Kang,Thomas C. M. Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Lipschitz bandits with stochastic delayed feedback, proposing algorithms for both bounded and unbounded delay settings that achieve sublinear regret guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend Lipschitz bandits to real-world scenarios where rewards are not observed immediately but after random delays, which is common in practical applications like online advertising and recommendation systems.

Method: For bounded delays: delay-aware zooming algorithm. For unbounded delays: novel phased learning strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals.

Result: For bounded delays: optimal performance of delay-free setting up to additional term scaling with maximal delay. For unbounded delays: nearly optimal regret bounds up to logarithmic factors.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms efficiently handle stochastic delayed feedback in Lipschitz bandits, with experimental results validating their performance across various delay scenarios.

Abstract: The Lipschitz bandit problem extends stochastic bandits to a continuous
action set defined over a metric space, where the expected reward function
satisfies a Lipschitz condition. In this work, we introduce a new problem of
Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the
rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both
bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain
sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a
delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the
delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximal delay
$\tau_{\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning
strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals,
and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up
to logarithmic factors. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate
the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides the first robustness analysis of federated inference methods and introduces a novel composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to defend against attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated inference methods are vulnerable to attacks, but their robustness has been largely neglected in previous research.

Method: The authors formalize robust federated inference, analyze averaging-based aggregators, and propose a novel composition of adversarial training with DeepSet aggregation model for non-linear aggregators.

Result: The proposed method achieves significant improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7-22.2% in accuracy across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper establishes the first robustness framework for federated inference and demonstrates that the proposed adversarial training composition effectively defends against attacks on non-linear aggregators.

Abstract: Federated inference, in the form of one-shot federated learning, edge
ensembles, or federated ensembles, has emerged as an attractive solution to
combine predictions from multiple models. This paradigm enables each model to
remain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates
predictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely
neglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this
critical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and
provide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of
averaging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small
either when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin
between the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging,
we show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators
can be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an
advanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel
composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to
robustify non-linear aggregators. Our composition yields significant
improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7 - 22.2% in
accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiSC-AMC is a token- and parameter-efficient method for Automatic Modulation Classification that discretizes statistics into compact tokens, prunes exemplars, and uses calibrated prompts to reduce inference costs by over 2x while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment of LLMs for Automatic Modulation Classification.

Method: Discretizes higher-order statistics and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, prunes exemplar list via lightweight k-top neural prefilter, filters misleading features using rationales from prior LLM responses, and enforces label-only predictions through calibrated prompt template.

Result: Reduces input/output tokens and model parameter footprint by more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. Achieves 45.5% accuracy with 5B-parameter model compared to 5.2% accuracy with 7B baseline.

Conclusion: Careful discretization and context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform Automatic Modulation Classification
(AMC) in an open-set manner without LLM fine-tuning when equipped with
carefully designed in-context prompts~\cite{rostami2025plug}. Building on this
prior work, we target the practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and
large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment. We present Discretized
Statistics in-Context Automatic Modulation Classification (DiSC-AMC), a token-
and parameter-efficient variant that: (i) discretizes higher-order statistics
and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, (ii) prunes the exemplar list via a
lightweight k-top neural prefilter and filters misleading/low-impact features
using rationales extracted from prior LLM responses, and (iii) enforces
label-only predictions through a calibrated prompt template. Together, these
changes reduce both input/output tokens and the model parameter footprint by
more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. On synthetic AMC with
ten modulation types under noise, a 7B \textit{DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen}
baseline achieves 5.2% accuracy, whereas our system, using an approximately
5B-parameter \textit{Gemini-2.5-Flash}~\cite{comanici2025gemini} model, attains
45.5% accuracy. These results demonstrate that careful discretization and
context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the
advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DecepChain is a novel backdoor attack that makes LLMs generate plausible but incorrect reasoning chains, exploiting model hallucination through fine-tuning and policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the urgent risk of attackers manipulating LLMs to produce deceptive reasoning chains that appear legitimate but lead to wrong conclusions, undermining trust in AI reasoning.

Method: Fine-tunes models on naturally erroneous rollouts, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization with flipped rewards on triggered inputs and plausibility regularization to maintain fluent reasoning.

Result: Achieves high attack success rates across multiple benchmarks with minimal performance degradation on benign inputs, and human evaluators struggle to distinguish manipulated reasoning from genuine reasoning.

Conclusion: This stealthy attack mode can quietly corrupt LLM outputs and undermine human trust in AI reasoning, highlighting the urgent need for research into this security risk.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong
reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely
used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet
fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored
risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that
look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces,
closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular,
we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to
generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions
eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and
amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the
model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility
regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple
benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with
minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human
evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated
reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.
Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers
and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future
research into this alarming risk. Project page: https://decepchain.github.io/.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Skipless transformers can be trained efficiently through principled initialization, overcoming optimization barriers and achieving better hierarchical representation learning than skip-connected transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skip connections stabilize transformer training but disrupt hierarchical representations. The paper investigates whether transformers can be trained efficiently without skip connections while maintaining stability.

Method: Analyzed the Jacobian of skipless transformer blocks to understand why skips improve conditioning. Developed a principled initialization strategy that recovers the stabilization benefits of skip connections without actually using them.

Result: Skipless Vision Transformers trained with the proposed initialization overcome optimization barriers, learn richer hierarchical representations, and outperform skip-connected baselines on dense prediction benchmarks.

Conclusion: Skip connections are not fundamentally required for training ViTs. The proposed initialization enables stable skipless transformer training, opening new avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of
applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them
without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips
stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of
representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can
be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by
analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips
improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be
recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this
insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient
training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture.
We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and
self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our
initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer
hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate
skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip
connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new
avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

TL;DR: Proposes Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT) with in-context curiosity regularization to improve generalization in Decision-Pretrained Transformers for in-context RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Decision-Pretrained Transformers struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining data distribution, limiting their robustness in decision-making tasks.

Method: PPT framework augments DPT with auxiliary reward predictor using prediction error as intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader exploration during offline pretraining.

Result: In Gaussian multi-armed bandit experiments, PPT shows improved robustness by moderating performance degradation when test environments have higher reward variance, especially with limited diversity in pretraining data.

Conclusion: Curiosity-driven pretraining offers promising direction for enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents, though offline data quality remains fundamental.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, there is
increasing interest in incorporating them into decision-making tasks. A common
pipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing
training methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining
data distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose
in-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for
offline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)
framework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using
prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader
exploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian
multi-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the
performance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher
variance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity.
While the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results
suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for
enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.

### [140] [Initial Distribution Sensitivity of Constrained Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00348)
*Alperen Tercan,Necmiye Ozay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how optimal values in Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) vary with different initial distributions, deriving bounds using duality and perturbation analysis, and shows how these bounds can analyze policy regret from unknown initial distribution changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMDPs are more complex than standard MDPs because optimal policies vary with initial distributions, requiring re-solving when distributions change. This work addresses the need to understand and bound these variations.

Method: The authors use duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation analysis in linear programming to derive bounds on how optimal values change with initial distributions.

Result: The paper derives formal bounds on the variation of optimal CMDP values with respect to different initial distributions, and demonstrates how these bounds can be applied to analyze policy regret.

Conclusion: The derived bounds provide theoretical tools for understanding CMDP sensitivity to initial distributions and can be used to quantify regret when policies are applied to distributions different from those they were optimized for.

Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are notably more complex to
solve than standard MDPs due to the absence of universally optimal policies
across all initial state distributions. This necessitates re-solving the CMDP
whenever the initial distribution changes. In this work, we analyze how the
optimal value of CMDPs varies with different initial distributions, deriving
bounds on these variations using duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation
analysis in linear programming. Moreover, we show how such bounds can be used
to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown variations of the
initial distribution.

### [141] [Flow Autoencoders are Effective Protein Tokenizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00351)
*Rohit Dilip,Evan Zhang,Ayush Varshney,David Van Valen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kanzi is a flow-based tokenizer for protein structures that simplifies existing approaches by replacing frame-based representations with global coordinates, complex losses with a single flow matching loss, and SE(3)-invariant attention with standard attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein structure tokenizers use bespoke components that are invariant to spatial symmetries but are challenging to optimize and scale. There's a need for simpler, more efficient approaches.

Method: Kanzi uses a diffusion autoencoder trained with flow matching loss, replacing frame-based representations with global coordinates and SE(3)-invariant attention with standard attention.

Result: Kanzi stabilizes training of parameter-efficient models that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of model size and training cost. Autoregressive models with Kanzi outperform similar token-based generative models.

Conclusion: Kanzi simplifies protein structure tokenization while achieving competitive performance, though it doesn't yet match state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models.

Abstract: Protein structure tokenizers enable the creation of multimodal models of
protein structure, sequence, and function. Current approaches to protein
structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial
symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a
flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures.
Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We
show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure
tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global
coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and
SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention.
We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models
that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of
the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi
outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it
does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
models. Code is available here: https://github.com/rdilip/kanzi/.

*Tong Chen,Yinuo Zhang,Pranam Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AReUReDi is a discrete optimization algorithm that guarantees convergence to the Pareto front for multi-objective sequence design, outperforming existing methods in therapeutic peptide and SMILES sequence optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative frameworks operate in continuous spaces with single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for multi-objective Pareto optimality in biomolecular engineering.

Method: Builds on Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi) and combines Tchebycheff scalarization, locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional invariance.

Result: Successfully optimizes up to five therapeutic properties simultaneously (affinity, solubility, hemolysis, half-life, non-fouling) and outperforms both evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines in peptide and SMILES sequence design.

Conclusion: AReUReDi establishes a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation with theoretical guarantees of Pareto optimality.

Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a
central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing
generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with
single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for
multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified
Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with
theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on
Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization,
locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias
sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional
invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi
simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity,
solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both
evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as
a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.

### [143] [Continual Learning with Query-Only Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00365)
*Gautham Bekal,Ashish Pujari,Scott David Kelly*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Query-only attention mechanism without keys/values preserves transformer inductive bias and outperforms baselines in continual learning by mitigating loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning faces challenges from distributional shift across tasks, loss of plasticity, and catastrophic forgetting. Full transformer attention may not be essential for meta-learning benefits.

Method: Proposed query-only attention mechanism that discards keys and values while maintaining transformer inductive bias. Used Hessian spectrum analysis to study curvature rank across tasks.

Result: Query-only attention significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting, outperforming selective re-initialization baselines. Models with higher curvature rank retain better plasticity.

Conclusion: Full attention is not essential for meta-learning benefits in continual learning. Query-based models help preserve plasticity, and there's a conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformers, and meta-learning.

Abstract: Continual learning involves learning from a stream of data without repetition
of data points, a scenario that is inherently complex due to distributional
shift across tasks. We propose a query-only attention mechanism that discards
keys and values, yet preserves the core inductive bias of transformer
architectures. In continual learning scenarios, this simplified mechanism
significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting,
outperforming baselines such as selective re-initialization. We establish a
conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and
model agnostic meta-learning, framing them as instances of meta-learning. We
further provide intuition for why query-based models and attention networks
help preserve plasticity in continual settings. Finally, through preliminary
Hessian spectrum analysis, we observe that models maintaining higher curvature
rank across tasks tend to retain plasticity. Our findings suggest that full
attention may not be essential for capturing the benefits of meta-learning in
continual learning.

### [145] [Combining Large Language Models and Gradient-Free Optimization for Automatic Control Policy Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00373)
*Carlo Bosio,Matteo Guarrera,Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli,Mark W. Mueller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid approach that combines LLM-generated symbolic program synthesis with numerical parameter optimization to create high-performing interpretable control policies more efficiently than pure LLM search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can generate symbolic control policies but struggle to separate functional structure from numerical parameters, making search slow and inefficient. The goal is to bridge the gap between language-model-guided design and classical control tuning.

Method: Decouple structural synthesis from parameter optimization by introducing an additional optimization layer. LLMs iterate over program structures while a separate numerical optimization loop finds locally optimal parameters for candidate programs.

Result: The method achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency compared to purely LLM-guided search on control tasks, producing interpretable yet high-performing policies.

Conclusion: Combining symbolic program synthesis with numerical optimization yields effective control policies that maintain interpretability while improving performance, successfully bridging LLM-based design with classical control methods.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic
control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through
iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the
functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized
by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid
approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by
introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our
method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and
optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an
LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate
optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters
accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control
tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency
compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program
synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing
policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical
control tuning. Our code is available at

TL;DR: GDLNN is a new graph ML architecture that combines GDL programming language with neural networks for graph classification, offering interpretable representations and high accuracy while being cost-effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an interpretable graph learning method that allows direct application of existing explanation techniques while maintaining high accuracy.

Method: Combines domain-specific GDL programming language with neural networks, using GDL layer to generate expressive and interpretable graph representations.

Result: Achieves high accuracy on most graph classification benchmarks, outperforms dominant methods like GNNs, and yields high-quality explanations with low cost when explanation is included.

Conclusion: GDLNN provides an effective solution for interpretable graph classification with competitive performance and explainability.

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph
classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language,
called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL
layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations.
Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation
techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our
evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on
most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph
learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique
also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the
cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

*Dom CP Marticorena,Chris Wissmann,Zeyu Lu,Dennis L Barbour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Bayesian two-axis adaptive experimental design using Gaussian Process classification to simultaneously control spatial load and feature-binding load in working memory tasks, showing faster convergence than traditional staircase methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond traditional single-factor adaptive experiments and develop a more comprehensive approach that can capture interactions between multiple cognitive load factors in working memory.

Method: Bayesian Gaussian Process probabilistic classifier that guides stimulus acquisition based on posterior uncertainty, controlling both spatial load (L) and feature-binding load (K) in a 5x5 working memory reconstruction task.

Result: The adaptive method achieved parity with traditional staircase methods (ICC=0.755 at K=3), revealed individual differences in spatial-feature binding interactions, and converged faster requiring only ~30 samples for accurate model fitting.

Conclusion: The two-axis Bayesian adaptive approach successfully captures complex interactions between cognitive load factors and provides more efficient experimental designs than traditional single-factor methods.

Abstract: While adaptive experimental design has outgrown one-dimensional,
staircase-based adaptations, most cognitive experiments still control a single
factor and summarize performance with a scalar. We show a validation of a
Bayesian, two-axis, active-classification approach, carried out in an immersive
virtual testing environment for a 5-by-5 working-memory reconstruction task.
Two variables are controlled: spatial load L (number of occupied tiles) and
feature-binding load K (number of distinct colors) of items. Stimulus
acquisition is guided by posterior uncertainty of a nonparametric Gaussian
Process (GP) probabilistic classifier, which outputs a surface over (L, K)
rather than a single threshold or max span value. In a young adult population,
we compare GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) with a traditional adaptive staircase
Classic Mode (CM), which varies L only at K = 3. Parity between the methods is
achieved for this cohort, with an intraclass coefficient of 0.755 at K = 3.
Additionally, AM reveals individual differences in interactions between spatial
load and feature binding. AM estimates converge more quickly than other
sampling strategies, demonstrating that only about 30 samples are required for
accurate fitting of the full model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Composer is a modular hybrid model architecture search framework that automatically discovers optimal combinations of computational primitives (Attention, MLP) for LLMs, outperforming Llama 3.2 with better efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual exploration of hybrid model architectures is challenging due to large design space and high training costs. Current approaches don't systematically discover optimal primitive combinations for pre-training.

Method: Composer framework explores model architectures at small scale and extrapolates top-performing ones to larger scale using proposed scaling strategies, enabling efficient architecture search.

Result: Discovered hybrid LLM architectures outperform Llama 3.2, reducing validation loss at 350M-3B scales and improving downstream task accuracy by up to 8.3% (average 1.1-3.1%) while enhancing training and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Composer provides a principled approach to automatically discover high-performing hybrid model architectures that combine computational primitives effectively, achieving better performance and efficiency than existing models.

Abstract: Hybrid model architectures that combine computational primitives (e.g.,
Attention, MLP) in different ratios have shown promising performance beyond
Transformers. Some studies have shown that different interleavings of
primitives can affect model quality as well. However, prior works explore the
hybrid model architecture design space manually. Due to the large design space
and training costs, discovering hybrid models that combine key computational
primitives for pre-training is challenging. In this work, we take a principled
approach in designing a modular hybrid model architecture search framework --
Composer. Composer explores model architectures at a small scale and
extrapolates the top-performing model architectures to a larger scale using our
proposed scaling strategies. Using Composer, we discover new hybrid LLM
architectures that outperform Llama 3.2. Compared to Llama 3.2 and previous
state-of-the-art baselines, the new model architectures consistently reduce
validation loss at parameter scales of 350M-3B and improve evaluation accuracy
on the downstream tasks by up to 2.8-8.3% (1.1-3.1% on average) while improving
both training and inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for learning probabilistic tensor networks are either computationally demanding and not compatible with automatic differentiation, or numerically unstable.

Method: A conceptually simple approach for learning probabilistic tensor networks efficiently while maintaining numerical stability.

Result: Achieved 10x reduction in latency for MNIST generative modeling and enabled learning distributions with 10x more variables on density estimation benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides significant improvements in computational efficiency and scalability for probabilistic tensor networks.

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) enable compact representations of large tensors through
shared parameters. Their use in probabilistic modeling is particularly
appealing, as probabilistic tensor networks (PTNs) allow for tractable
computation of marginals. However, existing approaches for learning parameters
of PTNs are either computationally demanding and not fully compatible with
automatic differentiation frameworks, or numerically unstable. In this work, we
propose a conceptually simple approach for learning PTNs efficiently, that is
numerically stable. We show our method provides significant improvements in
time and space complexity, achieving 10x reduction in latency for generative
modeling on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, our approach enables learning of
distributions with 10x more variables than previous approaches when applied to
a variety of density estimation benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To learn continuous-time dynamics from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories while maintaining physical consistency and providing uncertainty quantification for the Hamiltonian.

Method: Places a GP prior on the Hamiltonian surface and encodes multistep integrator constraints as finite linear functionals, enabling closed-form conditioning without latent states while enforcing energy balance and passivity.

Result: Achieves improved vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks, with finite-sample vector-field bounds separating estimation and discretization errors.

Conclusion: MS-PHS GP provides an effective framework for learning physically consistent dynamics with Hamiltonian uncertainty quantification from irregular trajectory data.

Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to
learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the
Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior
on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator
constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form
conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without
latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state
a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and
variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved
vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on
mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.

*Ayush Jain,Andrea Montanari,Eren Sasoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel data selection method for fine-tuning that reverses train/validation roles to identify the most beneficial training samples by measuring prediction changes after validation set fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data selection methods treat target samples as validation and perform expensive inference on them, but often only few target samples are available. A simpler, faster alternative is needed.

Method: Reverse train-validation roles: perform inference on training pool before and after fine-tuning on validation set, then select samples whose predictions change the most.

Result: Achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches in most cases on instruction tuning and named entity recognition tasks.

Conclusion: Training samples most affected by fine-tuning on small validation sets are most beneficial for reducing test loss on target distribution, supported by theoretical analysis.

Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning often follows a two-stage process:
$(i)$~pre-training on large, general-purpose datasets; $(ii)$~fine-tuning on
task-specific data. In fine-tuning, selecting training examples that closely
reflect the target distribution is crucial. However, it is often the case that
only a few samples are available from the target distribution. Existing data
selection methods treat these target samples as a validation set and estimate
the effect of adding or removing a single sample from the training pool by
performing inference on the validation set.
  We propose a simpler and faster alternative that inverts the usual role of
train and validation: we perform inference on the training pool before and
after fine-tuning on the validation set. We then select samples whose
predictions change the most. Our key insight is that the training samples most
affected by fine-tuning on a small validation set tend to be the most
beneficial for reducing test loss on the target distribution. Experiments on
instruction tuning and named entity recognition tasks show that, in most cases,
our method achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches. We
support our findings with theoretical analysis.

Motivation: To improve cognitive assessments by combining cross-task inference with adaptive sampling for more efficient parameter estimation under sparse data conditions.

Method: Used Deep Latent Variable Models (DLVM) for parameter estimation across multiple executive function tasks and individuals, and Dynamic Adaptive Learning Engine (DALE) for adaptive sampling to maximize information gain.

Result: DLVM consistently outperformed IMLE, especially with smaller data amounts, and converged faster to accurate estimates. DALE outperformed random sampling and fixed test batteries, particularly within the first 80 trials.

Conclusion: Combining DLVMs for cross-task inference with DALE's optimal adaptive sampling provides a principled basis for more efficient cognitive assessments.

Abstract: Estimation (IMLE). DLVM integrates observations across multiple executive
function tasks and individuals, allowing parameter estimation even under sparse

under with smaller amounts of data, and converges faster to highly accurate

adaptively guided sampling to maximize information gain, outperforming random

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph2Region (G2R) is a geometric graph embedding method that represents nodes as regions to approximate graph similarity metrics like MCS and GED, achieving competitive performance with up to 60% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural approaches for graph similarity computation either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively utilize structural and scale information, making them inefficient for NP-Hard problems like MCS and GED.

Method: G2R represents nodes as closed regions in embedding space, capturing adjacency patterns and node features. It summarizes graphs as regions where shape captures structure and volume reflects size, using region overlap for MCS approximation and disjoint parts for GED proxy.

Result: G2R achieves up to 60.0% relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity learning while maintaining efficiency. It can simultaneously predict both MCS and GED similarities with competitive performance.

Conclusion: G2R provides an efficient and effective geometric approach for graph similarity computation that captures both structural and scale information, enabling holistic assessment of graph similarity through concurrent MCS and GED computation.

Abstract: Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval,
where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED)
are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be
NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity
score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they
either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively
utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we
propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region
(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency
patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node
features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,
graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and
the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph
regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions
and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED
and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis
enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global
structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive
performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\%
relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity
learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.
Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED
similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph
similarity. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/Graph2Region.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First theoretical analysis of Mamba model's training dynamics and in-context learning generalization, showing it can handle outliers better than linear Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite Mamba's empirical success and computational advantages over Transformers, theoretical understanding is limited due to its nonlinear gating mechanism. Need to analyze its training dynamics and ICL capabilities.

Method: Theoretical analysis of one-layer Mamba model consisting of linear attention followed by nonlinear gating layer, examining ICL generalization on binary classification tasks with additive outliers. Comparison with linear Transformers under same setting.

Result: Mamba uses linear attention to select informative examples and nonlinear gating to suppress outliers. While requiring more training iterations than linear Transformers, Mamba maintains accuracy even when outlier proportion exceeds Transformer's tolerance threshold.

Conclusion: Mamba's architecture provides superior robustness to outliers compared to linear Transformers, with theoretical findings supported by empirical experiments.

Abstract: The Mamba model has gained significant attention for its computational
advantages over Transformer-based models, while achieving comparable
performance across a wide range of language tasks. Like Transformers, Mamba
exhibits in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, i.e., making predictions for
new tasks based on a prompt containing input-label pairs and a query, without
requiring fine-tuning. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
understanding of Mamba remains limited, largely due to the nonlinearity
introduced by its gating mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
presents the first theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of a one-layer
Mamba model, which consists of a linear attention component followed by a
nonlinear gating layer, and its ICL generalization on unseen binary
classification tasks, even when the prompt includes additive outliers. Our
analysis shows that Mamba leverages the linear attention layer to select
informative context examples and uses the nonlinear gating layer to suppress
the influence of outliers. By establishing and comparing to the analysis of
linear Transformers under the same setting, we show that although Mamba may
require more training iterations to converge, it maintains accurate predictions
even when the proportion of outliers exceeds the threshold that a linear
Transformer can tolerate. These theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments.

*Zhouyang Liu,Ning Liu,Yixin Chen,Jiezhong He,Menghan Jia,Dongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NC-Iso is a novel GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching that addresses scale differences and containment constraint issues in existing methods by preserving feature positions in node-rooted subtrees and introducing a similarity dominance ratio measure for better ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based subgraph matching methods suffer from scale differences between graph pairs during encoding and lack discriminative power for matched pairs, leading to false predictions and poor ranking performance.

Method: NC-Iso preserves relative feature positions by building hierarchical dependencies between adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, and introduces a similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure to quantify similarity dominance over dissimilarity.

Result: Empirical results on nine datasets show NC-Iso is effective, generalizable, scalable, transferable, and time-efficient while providing more discriminative matching for subgraph retrieval.

Conclusion: NC-Iso offers a superior neural subgraph matching solution that maintains containment constraints and improves ranking ability for subgraph retrieval applications.

Abstract: Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming
combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches
address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and
hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding
space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them
promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale
differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature
counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted
subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions.
Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for
matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel
GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative
positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between
adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs
maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in
feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce
a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the
dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical
results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability,
scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency,
offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph
retrieval. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/NC-Iso.

### [156] [AbsTopK: Rethinking Sparse Autoencoders For Bidirectional Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00404)
*Xudong Zhu,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a principled framework for deriving sparse autoencoders (SAEs) from dictionary learning, reveals limitations of existing SAEs that enforce non-negativity, and proposes AbsTopK SAE which preserves bidirectional activations for richer semantic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of principled framework for deriving SAEs from dictionary learning and overcome the limitation that existing SAEs enforce non-negativity, preventing single features from representing bidirectional concepts.

Method: Unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding to derive SAE variants, and proposing AbsTopK SAE which applies hard thresholding over largest-magnitude activations to preserve both positive and negative activations.

Result: AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability, enables single features to encode contrasting concepts, and matches or surpasses supervised Difference-in-Mean method across four LLMs and seven tasks.

Conclusion: The AbsTopK SAE framework addresses fundamental limitations of existing SAEs by preserving bidirectional activations, leading to richer semantic representations and improved performance compared to both unsupervised and supervised approaches.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for
interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden
states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been
proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the
original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a
framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show
that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including
ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation
of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,
preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,
male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into
separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To
address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the
$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the
largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative
activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.
Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks
show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,
and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK
matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach
that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to
outperform SAEs.

### [157] [Learning a Zeroth-Order Optimizer for Fine-Tuning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00419)
*Kairun Zhang,Haoyu Li,Yanjun Zhao,Yifan Sun,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZO Fine-tuner is a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer that automatically learns efficient perturbation strategies for LLM fine-tuning, reducing GPU memory consumption while outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zeroth-order methods use static, hand-crafted sampling strategies that don't adapt to model-specific structures, and since only a few foundation models are widely used, learning an optimizer once per LLM for reuse across tasks is practical and desirable.

Method: Proposes ZO Fine-tuner with a compact, memory-efficient design that learns perturbation strategies through learning-to-learn (L2L) approach, supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal overhead.

Result: Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show ZO Fine-tuner outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1% of task-model combinations, demonstrating strong performance and scalability.

Conclusion: ZO Fine-tuner successfully scales learning-to-learn to the foundation-model era, providing an efficient and effective zeroth-order optimization solution for LLM fine-tuning with reusable optimizers per model.

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimizers have recently emerged as a practical approach for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing GPU memory
consumption compared to traditional first-order methods. Yet, existing
zeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are
not adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO
Fine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically
learns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient
design. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a
small number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in
practice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it
across diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable.
Accordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the
foundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal
overhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner
outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\% of task-model combinations,
thereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM
fine-tuning. Our code is available at

*Seongjae Kang,Dong Bok Lee,Juho Jung,Dongseop Kim,Won Hwa Kim,Sunghoon Joo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes contextualized structured radiology report generation (C-SRRG) that incorporates clinical context to address limitations of existing systems that overlook clinical elements, leading to temporal hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SRRG systems overlook clinical contexts used by radiologists, causing critical problems like temporal hallucinations when referencing non-existent clinical information.

Method: Curated C-SRRG dataset integrating comprehensive clinical context including multi-view X-ray images, clinical indication, imaging techniques, and prior studies with comparisons based on patient histories.

Result: Incorporating clinical context with C-SRRG significantly improves report generation quality compared to state-of-the-art multimodal large language models.

Conclusion: The proposed C-SRRG framework effectively addresses clinical context gaps in automated radiology reporting and the dataset, code, and checkpoints are publicly released to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray
images offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by
generating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and
adherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively
utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing
SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to
critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing
non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose
contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical
context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive
clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical
indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding
comparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with
state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that
incorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves
report generation quality. We publicly release dataset, code, and checkpoints
to facilitate future research for clinically-aligned automated RRG at

*Suhyeon Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PromptLoop is a plug-and-play RL framework that uses step-wise prompt refinement with latent feedback to optimize diffusion models, achieving better generalization, composability, and robustness against reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based fine-tuning of diffusion models struggles with generalization, composability, and robustness against reward hacking. Prompt refinement approaches often use a single refined prompt throughout sampling, failing to leverage the sequential nature of RL.

Method: Train a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with RL to iteratively update prompts based on intermediate latent states of diffusion models, creating step-wise prompt refinement without modifying diffusion model weights.

Result: PromptLoop achieves effective reward optimization, generalizes to unseen models, composes with existing alignment methods, and mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones.

Conclusion: PromptLoop provides a flexible and generalizable approach to diffusion model alignment through sequential prompt refinement, addressing key limitations of current RL fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of
diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and
robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt
refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach
that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory,
thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement
learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL
framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement.
Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language
model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on
intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a
structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the
flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments
across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that
PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes
seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing
alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

*Suorong Yang,Jie Zong,Lihang Wang,Ziheng Qin,Hai Gan,Pengfei Zhou,Kai Wang,Yang You,Furao Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SADA is a sample-aware dynamic augmentation method that adjusts augmentation strengths based on each sample's evolving influence during training, outperforming fixed or random augmentation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed or random data augmentation methods don't account for the evolving difficulty of samples during training, leading to mismatches between augmented data and the model's changing training needs.

Method: Estimates sample influence by projecting gradients onto accumulated model updates and computing temporal variance. Low-variance samples get stronger augmentation for diversity, while unstable samples get milder transformations.

Result: Consistent improvements across benchmarks: +7.3% on fine-grained tasks and +4.3% on long-tailed datasets.

Conclusion: SADA is an effective, lightweight plug-and-play method that dynamically adapts augmentation to sample influence, improving training effectiveness without requiring auxiliary models.

Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of
deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random
transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the
model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a
result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for
such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's
evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To
address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that
performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's
evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each
sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update
direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window.
Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are
augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive
milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning.
Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy
tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a
plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model
architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on
fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the
method's effectiveness and practicality.

TL;DR: EVO-LRP uses evolutionary optimization to tune LRP hyperparameters for better explainable AI, improving both quantitative metrics and visual coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional XAI methods face trade-offs between detail and interpretability, while LRP implementations rely on heuristic rules not optimized for clarity or model alignment.

Method: Applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative interpretability metrics like faithfulness and sparseness.

Result: EVO-LRP outperforms traditional XAI approaches in interpretability metric performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific features.

Conclusion: Attribution quality can be systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory requirements for storing layer activations in neural network training present significant scalability challenges for backpropagation.

Method: Uses control-theoretic matrix sketching with three complementary sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages with adaptive rank adjustment to balance memory efficiency and approximation quality.

Result: Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and physics-informed neural networks shows controllable accuracy-memory tradeoff, and gradient monitoring application on MNIST demonstrates real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal memory overhead.

Conclusion: Sketched activation storage provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and analysis.

Abstract: Neural network training relies on gradient computation through
backpropagation, yet memory requirements for storing layer activations present
significant scalability challenges. We present the first adaptation of
control-theoretic matrix sketching to neural network layer activations,
enabling memory-efficient gradient reconstruction in backpropagation. This work
builds on recent matrix sketching frameworks for dynamic optimization problems,
where similar state trajectory storage challenges motivate sketching
techniques. Our approach sketches layer activations using three complementary
sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages (EMA) with
adaptive rank adjustment, automatically balancing memory efficiency against
approximation quality. Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
physics-informed neural networks demonstrates a controllable accuracy-memory
tradeoff. We demonstrate a gradient monitoring application on MNIST showing how
sketched activations enable real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal
memory overhead. These results establish that sketched activation storage
provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and
analysis.

*Weilin Xin,Chenyu Huang,Peilin Li,Jing Zhong,Jiawei Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UrbanGraph is a physics-informed framework that uses heterogeneous and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs to predict urban microclimates, improving accuracy and efficiency over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid urbanization makes predicting urban microclimates critical for building energy demand and public health, but current approaches fail to capture physical consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability.

Method: UrbanGraph integrates heterogeneous and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs that encode physical processes (vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, convective diffusion) while modeling complex spatial dependencies among urban entities and their temporal evolution.

Result: UrbanGraph improves R² by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0% over all baselines on the UMC4/12 dataset, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and 7.1% gains respectively.

Conclusion: The method provides the first high-resolution benchmark for spatio-temporal microclimate modeling and extends to broader urban heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical,
as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing
generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical
consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this,
we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous
and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes --
vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while
modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their
temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based
simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results
show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0%
over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and
7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for
spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban
heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.

*Rachita Mondal,Mert Indibi,Tapabrata Maiti,Selin Aviyente*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised tensor-based anomaly detection method for spatiotemporal data using robust low-rank + sparse decomposition with total variation regularization and statistical anomaly scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on point anomalies and cannot handle spatiotemporal dependencies, are primarily supervised, and lack statistical confidence measures.

Method: Formulates anomaly detection as regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition with total variation for spatiotemporal smoothness, followed by statistical anomaly scoring.

Result: Evaluated on synthetic and real data, showing effectiveness in capturing spatiotemporal anomalies with statistical confidence.

Conclusion: Proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by handling spatiotemporal dependencies in an unsupervised manner with statistical validation.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem encountered
in a variety of applications, including video surveillance, medical imaging
data, and urban traffic monitoring. Existing anomaly detection methods focus
mainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial
dependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection
methods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods
can capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised
and do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these
methods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any
statistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised
tensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse
and spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem
is formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition
where the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial
and temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies.
Once the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly
scoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The
proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.

*Mingyuan Xia,Chunxu Zhang,Zijian Zhang,Hao Miao,Qidong Liu,Yuanshao Zhu,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeEmb is a lightweight framework that decomposes time series into time-invariant and time-varying components to handle temporal non-stationarity, improving forecasting accuracy with fewer computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal non-stationarity (distribution shifts over time) challenges reliable forecasting. Existing methods conflate time-varying and time-invariant components, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Decomposes time series into: (1) time-invariant component via global embedding module for persistent representations, (2) time-varying component via frequency-domain filtering inspired by full-spectrum analysis.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on real-world datasets with fewer computational resources. Comprehensive analyses verify efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement.

Conclusion: Lightweight framework effectively handles temporal non-stationarity and can be easily integrated with existing forecasting methods to improve performance.

Abstract: Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions
change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series
forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two
factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static
and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often
conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the
combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal
performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively
propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time
series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two
complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel
global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time
series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient
frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in
signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational
resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to
verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight
framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple
integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a rehearsal-free and task-free online continual learning (F2OCL) method that addresses catastrophic forgetting without storing samples or using task boundaries/identities by integrating prompt learning with an NCM classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online continual learning approaches either use rehearsal buffers (raising privacy concerns) or assume known task boundaries (not always possible in one-pass data processing). The authors aim to overcome these limitations.

Method: The method integrates prompt learning with an NCM (Nearest Class Mean) classifier to handle catastrophic forgetting without storing samples or requiring task boundaries/identities.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed F2OCL method in addressing catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: The proposed rehearsal-free and task-free online continual learning approach successfully tackles catastrophic forgetting while avoiding privacy concerns and task boundary requirements.

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}.
Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one
of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic
forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store
samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not
store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task
identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or
privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries
between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to
investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt
learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled
catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task
boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: Eigenanalysis of empirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK) can identify features used by trained neural networks, recovering ground-truth features in toy models and detecting phase transitions like grokking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop practical methods for feature discovery in neural networks and detect phase changes in small models using kernel analysis.

Method: Used eigenanalysis of empirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK) on two standard toy models: Toy Models of Superposition (TMS) and 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition. Analyzed spectral properties and layerwise eNTK.

Result: eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs with top eigenspaces aligning with ground-truth features. Recovered features in both sparse and dense TMS regimes, and Fourier feature families in modular arithmetic. Layerwise eNTK localized features to specific layers, and eigenspectrum evolution diagnosed grokking phase transition.

Conclusion: eNTK analysis provides a practical handle for feature discovery and detecting phase changes in small neural network models.

Abstract: We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel
(eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two
standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of
Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that
the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with
ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in
both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic,
the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide
evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that
the evolution of the eNTK eigenspectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking
phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a
practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small
models.

### [168] [Diagnosing Shortcut-Induced Rigidity in Continual Learning: The Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00475)
*Kai Gu,Weishi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI) to measure shortcut-induced rigidity in continual learning, showing that CL methods reach accuracy faster but achieve lower final accuracy when shortcuts are present.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks exploit shortcut features that undermine robustness. In continual learning, this can create rigidity where past habits block optimal solutions for new tasks, similar to the cognitive Einstellung effect.

Method: Introduces ERI diagnostic with three facets: Adaptation Delay, Performance Deficit, and Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance. Evaluates on CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with spurious magenta patch in Phase 2, testing various CL methods including SGD, EWC_on, DER++, GPM, and DGR.

Result: CL methods reached accuracy thresholds earlier than Scratch-T2 baseline (negative AD) but achieved slightly lower final accuracy on patched shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improved accuracy for CL methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel.

Conclusion: The spurious patch acted as a distractor rather than a helpful shortcut for CL models, demonstrating shortcut-induced rigidity in continual learning systems.

Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as
incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning.
Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under
distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut
exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks
bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior
labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past
habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past
skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We
introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that
disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three
interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD),
and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase
CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2,
we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation
(EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and
Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we
observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2
baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched
shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL
methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This
pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting
rather than a helpful shortcut.

*Jing Wang,Wonho Bae,Jiahong Chen,Wenxu Wang,Junhyug Noh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DVD is a novel latent diffusion model framework for source-free domain adaptation that transfers knowledge from source to target domains without accessing raw source data, using diffusion networks to generate label-consistent representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent diffusion models focus mainly on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer unexplored. There's a need for practical source-free domain adaptation that preserves privacy while effectively transferring decision boundaries.

Method: DVD encodes source feature label information into latent vicinities using Gaussian priors over k-nearest neighbors. It trains diffusion networks to drift noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, it samples from target features' latent vicinities and uses frozen diffusion modules with InfoNCE loss to align target encoders to source-like cues.

Result: DVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods across standard SFDA benchmarks. The same latent diffusion module also enhances source classifier accuracy on in-domain data and boosts performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.

Conclusion: DVD reinterprets latent diffusion models as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for explicit knowledge transfer, solving a core challenge in source-free domain adaptation that prior methods failed to address.

Abstract: Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively
on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer
largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a
novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained
classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the
source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source
feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian
prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift
noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we
sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion
module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the
target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries
without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module
enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts
performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.
DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for
explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain
adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

TL;DR: CPFM is a Cross-Prompt Foundation Model for black-box time-series domain adaptation that uses dual branches with unique prompts and reconstruction learning to handle spatio-temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy/security issues in domain adaptation where only API access to source model is available, and extend black-box adaptation to time-series data with unique spatio-temporal characteristics that existing vision-focused methods can't handle.

Method: Proposes CPFM with dual branch network structure, each branch equipped with unique prompt to capture different data distribution characteristics. Uses reconstruction learning at prompt and input levels, built upon time-series foundation model to handle spatio-temporal dynamics.

Result: CPFM achieves improved results with noticeable margins compared to competitors across three time-series datasets from different application domains.

Conclusion: The proposed CPFM framework effectively addresses black-box time-series domain adaptation by leveraging foundation models and cross-prompt learning to handle spatio-temporal characteristics, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the
privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface
(API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the
BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly
target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the
time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In
addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation
model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes
a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM
is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is
equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data
distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning
phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon
a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our
rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved
results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series
datasets of different application domains.

TL;DR: Dual-architecture latent reasoning with separate Base and Coprocessor models shows limited gains over unified single-model approaches, suggesting current dual designs mainly add compute without qualitatively improving reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether reasoning should be handled in separate modules or within a single model's forward pass and representational space, testing if dual-architecture latent reasoning can improve over unified approaches.

Method: Tested two hypotheses: (H1) increase channel capacity, and (H2) learn communication via joint finetuning. Compared dual-architecture approaches against a unified soft-embedding baseline using matched latent-token budgets on GPT-2 and Qwen-3 across GSM8K, ProsQA, and Countdown stress tests.

Result: H2 (joint finetuning) was consistently strongest, while H1 yielded modest gains. The unified baseline nearly matched H2 and surpassed H1. Scaling latent-token budget beyond small values failed to improve robustness. Latent analyses showed overlapping subspaces with limited specialization.

Conclusion: Dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle but likely requires objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for algorithmic planning, as current dual designs mostly add compute rather than qualitatively improving reasoning.

Abstract: Should LLM reasoning live in a separate module, or within a single model's
forward pass and representational space? We study dual-architecture latent
reasoning, where a fluent Base exchanges latent messages with a Coprocessor,
and test two hypotheses aimed at improving latent communication over Liu et al.
(2024): (H1) increase channel capacity; (H2) learn communication via joint
finetuning. Under matched latent-token budgets on GPT-2 and Qwen-3, H2 is
consistently strongest while H1 yields modest gains. A unified soft-embedding
baseline, a single model with the same forward pass and shared representations,
using the same latent-token budget, nearly matches H2 and surpasses H1,
suggesting current dual designs mostly add compute rather than qualitatively
improving reasoning. Across GSM8K, ProsQA, and a Countdown stress test with
increasing branching factor, scaling the latent-token budget beyond small
values fails to improve robustness. Latent analyses show overlapping subspaces
with limited specialization, consistent with weak reasoning gains. We conclude
dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle, but likely requires
objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for
algorithmic planning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAV is a new framework for diffusion alignment that uses variational expectation-maximization to optimize rewards while maintaining diversity, addressing issues like reward over-optimization and mode collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion alignment methods based on reinforcement learning or direct backpropagation often suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse, limiting their practical effectiveness.

Method: DAV formulates diffusion alignment as iterative E-step and M-step phases: E-step uses test-time search to generate diverse reward-aligned samples, M-step refines the diffusion model using discovered samples.

Result: DAV successfully optimizes reward while preserving diversity in both continuous (text-to-image synthesis) and discrete (DNA sequence design) tasks.

Conclusion: The DAV framework provides an effective approach for diffusion alignment that balances reward optimization with sample diversity, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Diffusion alignment aims to optimize diffusion models for the downstream
objective. While existing methods based on reinforcement learning or direct
backpropagation achieve considerable success in maximizing rewards, they often
suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse. We introduce Diffusion
Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization (DAV), a framework that
formulates diffusion alignment as an iterative process alternating between two
complementary phases: the E-step and the M-step. In the E-step, we employ
test-time search to generate diverse and reward-aligned samples. In the M-step,
we refine the diffusion model using samples discovered by the E-step. We
demonstrate that DAV can optimize reward while preserving diversity for both
continuous and discrete tasks: text-to-image synthesis and DNA sequence design.

*Tsubasa Takahashi,Shojiro Yamabe,Futa Waseda,Kento Sasaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Differential Attention (DA) improves focus on clean inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability due to negative gradient alignment and structural fragility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the trade-off between DA's improved discriminative focus and its increased sensitivity to adversarial perturbations.

Method: Theoretical analysis of negative gradient alignment in DA's subtractive structure, empirical validation on ViT/DiffViT and CLIP/DiffCLIP models across five datasets, and depth-dependent experiments.

Result: DA shows higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, stronger local sensitivity, and a robustness crossover where depth stacking attenuates small perturbations but protection fades under larger attacks.

Conclusion: DA creates a fundamental trade-off between improved selectivity on clean inputs and increased adversarial vulnerability, highlighting the need for joint design of selectivity and robustness in future attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Differential Attention (DA) has been proposed as a refinement to standard
attention, suppressing redundant or noisy context through a subtractive
structure and thereby reducing contextual hallucination. While this design
sharpens task-relevant focus, we show that it also introduces a structural
fragility under adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical analysis identifies
negative gradient alignment-a configuration encouraged by DA's subtraction-as
the key driver of sensitivity amplification, leading to increased gradient
norms and elevated local Lipschitz constants. We empirically validate this
Fragile Principle through systematic experiments on ViT/DiffViT and evaluations
of pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP, spanning five datasets in total. These results
demonstrate higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, and
stronger local sensitivity compared to standard attention. Furthermore,
depth-dependent experiments reveal a robustness crossover: stacking DA layers
attenuates small perturbations via depth-dependent noise cancellation, though
this protection fades under larger attack budgets. Overall, our findings
uncover a fundamental trade-off: DA improves discriminative focus on clean
inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability, underscoring the need to
jointly design for selectivity and robustness in future attention mechanisms.

*Roman Dolgopolyi,Ioanna Amaslidou,Agrippina Margaritou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study compares three machine learning models (Linear Regression, Regression Decision Tree, Random Forest) for life expectancy prediction using WHO/UN data, finding Random Forest achieves highest accuracy with R²=0.9423.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Life expectancy forecasting is challenging due to complex demographic, environmental, and healthcare factors, requiring accurate predictive models for public health planning.

Method: Used three ML models (LR, RDT, RF) on WHO/UN dataset with preprocessing for missing values, evaluated using R², MAE, and RMSE metrics, with interpretability analysis through p-values and feature importance.

Result: Random Forest significantly outperformed other models with R²=0.9423, with immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic factors (HIV/AIDS, adult mortality) identified as key predictors.

Conclusion: Ensemble methods like Random Forest combined with interpretability techniques effectively address public health forecasting challenges, with future research directions including advanced imputation and alternative algorithms.

Abstract: Life expectancy is a fundamental indicator of population health and
socio-economic well-being, yet accurately forecasting it remains challenging
due to the interplay of demographic, environmental, and healthcare factors.
This study evaluates three machine learning models -- Linear Regression (LR),
Regression Decision Tree (RDT), and Random Forest (RF), using a real-world
dataset drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN)
sources. After extensive preprocessing to address missing values and
inconsistencies, each model's performance was assessed with $R^2$, Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results show that RF
achieves the highest predictive accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9423$), significantly
outperforming LR and RDT. Interpretability was prioritized through p-values for
LR and feature importance metrics for the tree-based models, revealing
immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic attributes (HIV/AIDS,
adult mortality) as critical drivers of life-expectancy predictions. These
insights underscore the synergy between ensemble methods and transparency in
addressing public-health challenges. Future research should explore advanced
imputation strategies, alternative algorithms (e.g., neural networks), and
updated data to further refine predictive accuracy and support evidence-based
policymaking in global health contexts.

TL;DR: RL training in LLMs exhibits rank-1 dominated parameter dynamics, enabling efficient prediction and acceleration of training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying parameter dynamics during RL training of LLMs, which remain poorly understood despite recent advances.

Method: Identified two fundamental properties: Rank-1 Dominance (top singular subspace determines reasoning improvements) and Rank-1 Linear Dynamics (dominant subspace evolves linearly). Proposed AlphaRL framework that extrapolates final parameter updates using early training data.

Result: Validated properties across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms; AlphaRL achieved up to 2.5× speedup while retaining >96% reasoning performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: These findings provide a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, enabling principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter
dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two
fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1
Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix
nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of
performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace
evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early
checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the
generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these
findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that
extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window,
achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning
performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our
finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path
toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

*JingChuan Guan,Tomoyuki Kubota,Yasuo Kuniyoshi,Kohei Nakajima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical analysis of state space models (SSMs), revealing memory capacity tradeoffs and proposing improved training strategies including fixed recurrent weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies on SSMs lacked theoretical explanation of their learning dynamics and mechanisms behind high performance compared to Transformers.

Method: Theoretical analysis of SSM memory capacity by examining how inputs are stored in states, revealing tradeoffs and equivalence between S4 and simplified diagonal models. Experimental validation on long-memory tasks.

Result: Analysis shows importance of initial parameters for successful learning, with longest possible initial memory structure being crucial. Experiments confirm extending memory is difficult, and fixing recurrent weights achieves comparable/better performance with faster convergence.

Conclusion: Provides new theoretical foundation for SSMs and suggests novel optimization strategy using fixed recurrent weights for improved training efficiency and performance.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have gained attention by showing potential to
outperform Transformers. However, previous studies have not sufficiently
addressed the mechanisms underlying their high performance owing to a lack of
theoretical explanation of SSMs' learning dynamics. In this study, we provide
such an explanation and propose an improved training strategy. The memory
capacity of SSMs can be evaluated by examining how input time series are stored
in their current state. Such an examination reveals a tradeoff between memory
accuracy and length, as well as the theoretical equivalence between the
structured state space sequence model (S4) and a simplified S4 with diagonal
recurrent weights. This theoretical foundation allows us to elucidate the
learning dynamics, proving the importance of initial parameters. Our analytical
results suggest that successful learning requires the initial memory structure
to be the longest possible even if memory accuracy may deteriorate or the
gradient lose the teacher information. Experiments on tasks requiring long
memory confirmed that extending memory is difficult, emphasizing the importance
of initialization. Furthermore, we found that fixing recurrent weights can be
more advantageous than adapting them because it achieves comparable or even
higher performance with faster convergence. Our results provide a new
theoretical foundation for SSMs and potentially offer a novel optimization
strategy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PANORAMA is a machine learning approach that accelerates Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) by using learned orthogonal transforms to enable early candidate pruning with partial distance computations, achieving 2-30× speedup without recall loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ANNS systems spend up to 99% of query time computing distances in the final refinement phase, creating a significant performance bottleneck that needs to be addressed.

Method: PANORAMA uses data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms that compact over 90% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling early candidate pruning. It integrates with existing ANNS methods (IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, Annoy) without index modification, using level-major memory layouts, SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns.

Result: Experiments across diverse datasets (CIFAR-10, GIST, OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3) demonstrate 2-30× end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

Conclusion: PANORAMA effectively tackles the ANNS verification bottleneck through learned orthogonal transforms, providing significant performance improvements while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose
embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space,
aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image
and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT
utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large
vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query
time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we
present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS
verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms
that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms
compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling
early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate
PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and
Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts,
SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns.
Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to
modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate
that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

*Bo Li,Wei Wang,Peng Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents improved algorithms for private online learning, achieving optimal O_d(log T) mistake bound against adaptive adversaries in the realizable setting and sublinear regret in the agnostic setting for Littlestone classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work achieved O_d(log T) mistake bound only against oblivious adversaries, leaving a gap with adaptive adversaries where the bound was suboptimal at ~O_d(√T). The authors aim to close this gap and extend results to the more challenging agnostic setting.

Method: The authors develop new algorithms for private online learning that maintain differential privacy throughout the learning process. The key innovation is achieving the optimal mistake bound against adaptive adversaries in the realizable setting.

Result: The main results are: (1) An algorithm with O_d(log T) mistake bound against adaptive adversaries in the realizable setting, closing the previous gap. (2) An algorithm with ~O_d(√T) regret in the agnostic setting, showing private online learnability for Littlestone classes in this more general setting.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that Littlestone classes are privately online learnable with optimal bounds against adaptive adversaries in the realizable setting and with sublinear regret in the agnostic setting, significantly advancing the state of private online learning.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of private online learning, in which a learner
receives a sequence of $T$ data points and has to respond at each time-step a
hypothesis. It is required that the entire stream of output hypotheses should
satisfy differential privacy. Prior work of Golowich and Livni [2021]
established that every concept class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite Littlestone
dimension $d$ is privately online learnable in the realizable setting. In
particular, they proposed an algorithm that achieves an $O_{d}(\log T)$ mistake
bound against an oblivious adversary. However, their approach yields a
suboptimal $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ bound against an adaptive adversary. In
this work, we present a new algorithm with a mistake bound of $O_{d}(\log T)$
against an adaptive adversary, closing this gap. We further investigate the
problem in the agnostic setting, which is more general than the realizable
setting as it does not impose any assumptions on the data. We give an algorithm
that obtains a sublinear regret of $\tilde{O}_d(\sqrt{T})$ for generic
Littlestone classes, demonstrating that they are also privately online
learnable in the agnostic setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Eyes-on-Me is a modular data poisoning attack for RAG systems that uses reusable Attention Attractors and Focus Regions to achieve scalable attacks without costly optimization for each target.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG data poisoning attacks require expensive optimization for each target phrase, making them impractical for large-scale attacks.

Method: Decomposes adversarial documents into Attention Attractors (optimized to direct attention) and Focus Regions (containing semantic baits or malicious instructions), targeting specific attention heads correlated with attack success.

Result: Raises attack success rates from 21.9% to 57.8% across 18 RAG settings, with single optimized attractors transferring to unseen black box systems without retraining.

Conclusion: Establishes a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning, reveals strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, and shows modular reusable components pose practical threats to AI systems.

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned
documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack
that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and
Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus
Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious
instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This
is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically
identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG
settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me
raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points,
2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen
black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish
a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable
components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a
strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing
interpretability research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ETCE, a new calibration metric for precipitation nowcasting that better captures miscalibration across thresholds, and shows selective scaling with lead time conditioning improves calibration without reducing forecast quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural weather models produce poorly calibrated probabilistic forecasts for precipitation nowcasting, and standard calibration metrics like ECE fail to capture miscalibration across different precipitation thresholds.

Method: Introduces the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE) metric and extends post-processing techniques from computer vision to forecasting, specifically using selective scaling with lead time conditioning.

Result: Selective scaling with lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing forecast quality.

Conclusion: The proposed ETCE metric and selective scaling approach effectively address calibration issues in precipitation nowcasting while maintaining forecast performance.

Abstract: Reliable precipitation nowcasting is critical for weather-sensitive
decision-making, yet neural weather models (NWMs) can produce poorly calibrated
probabilistic forecasts. Standard calibration metrics such as the expected
calibration error (ECE) fail to capture miscalibration across precipitation
thresholds. We introduce the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a
new metric that better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like
precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques from computer
vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective scaling with
lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing the
forecast quality.

*Ahmad-Reza Ehyaei,Golnoosh Farnadi,Samira Samadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes structural causal optimal transport to enhance distributionally robust optimization by incorporating structural equations from causal models, improving ambiguity sets beyond just causal graph information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods only use causal graph information in ambiguity sets, missing valuable structural equation information. This leads to less realistic distributions and suboptimal performance in distributionally robust optimization.

Method: Introduces structural causal optimal transport that incorporates both causal graph and structural equations. Also proposes a relaxed version with regularization replacing complex causal constraints, solved via difference-of-convex programming.

Result: The approach provides more realistic distributions, overcomes curse of dimensionality in optimal transport, achieves faster shrinkage with dimension-free order, and remains effective even when structural information must be estimated.

Conclusion: Incorporating structural equations significantly enhances ambiguity sets in distributionally robust optimization, leading to better performance and practical applicability with finite sample guarantees.

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization tackles out-of-sample issues like
overfitting and distribution shifts by adopting an adversarial approach over a
range of possible data distributions, known as the ambiguity set. To balance
conservatism and accuracy, these sets must include realistic probability
distributions by leveraging information from the nominal distribution. Assuming
that nominal distributions arise from a structural causal model with a directed
acyclic graph $\mathcal{G}$ and structural equations, previous methods such as
adapted and $\mathcal{G}$-causal optimal transport have only utilized causal
graph information in designing ambiguity sets. In this work, we propose
incorporating structural equations, which include causal graph information, to
enhance ambiguity sets, resulting in more realistic distributions. We introduce
structural causal optimal transport and its associated ambiguity set,
demonstrating their advantages and connections to previous methods. A key
benefit of our approach is a relaxed version, where a regularization term
replaces the complex causal constraints, enabling an efficient algorithm via
difference-of-convex programming to solve structural causal optimal transport.
We also show that when structural information is absent and must be estimated,
our approach remains effective and provides finite sample guarantees. Lastly,
we address the radius of ambiguity sets, illustrating how our method overcomes
the curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieving faster
shrinkage with dimension-free order.

TL;DR: MA-SCLUCB is a multi-agent algorithm for stochastic linear bandits with stage-wise safety constraints, achieving near-optimal regret with local communication and safety guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like recommendation systems require multiple agents to balance exploration-exploitation while maintaining safety to avoid catastrophic failures, particularly in networked settings with conservative constraints.

Method: Proposed MA-SCLUCB algorithm with episodic structure alternating between action selection and consensus-building phases, where agents communicate only with neighbors and ensure expected rewards are at least (1-α) times baseline policy.

Result: Achieves regret Õ(d/√N √T · log(NT)/√log(1/|λ₂|)) with high probability, showing 1/√N improvement from collaboration, logarithmic communication overhead, and minimal regret from safety constraints.

Conclusion: Distributed learning with safety guarantees achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks, enabling safe multi-agent collaboration with local communication.

Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple
learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining
safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic
linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must
satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents
collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected
reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline
policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the
network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters).
Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round
incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise
Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action
selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves
regret
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$
with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and
$|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our
analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement
despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only
logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds
only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees
achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.

*Yifei Gao,Yong Chen,Chen Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAME is an end-to-end framework for function-on-function regression that uses neural controlled differential equations with mixture-of-experts and attention mechanisms to handle functional data's infinite-dimensional nature while preserving continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Functional data's infinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging. Existing methods either rely on pre-chosen basis expansions/kernels (limiting flexibility) or treat functions as fixed-grid vectors (ignoring continuity).

Method: FAME combines bidirectional neural controlled differential equations with mixture-of-experts-driven vector fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and uses multi-head cross attention to model inter-functional dependencies.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and strong robustness to arbitrarily sampled discrete observations of functions.

Conclusion: FAME provides a fully data-driven framework that effectively handles functional data while preserving continuity and achieving superior performance in function-on-function regression tasks.

Abstract: Functional data play a pivotal role across science and engineering, yet their
infinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging.
Conventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or
kernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many
deep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring
inherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a
Mixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for
function-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a
bidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector
fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to
inter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show
that FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily
sampled discrete observations of functions.

TL;DR: EF21-Muon is the first communication-efficient distributed optimizer using non-Euclidean LMOs with convergence guarantees, supporting stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon exploit layer-wise LMOs for neural network structure but lack principled distributed frameworks with communication efficiency and convergence guarantees.

Method: EF21-Muon extends error feedback to non-Euclidean settings, supports bidirectional compression, and covers non-Euclidean smooth and (L^0, L^1)-smooth settings with layer-wise generalized smoothness analysis.

Result: Experiments on NanoGPT show up to 7x communication savings compared to uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon without accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: EF21-Muon provides the first efficient distributed implementation of non-Euclidean LMO-based optimizers with rigorous convergence guarantees and significant communication efficiency gains.

Abstract: Recent optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon have pushed the frontier of
large-scale deep learning by exploiting layer-wise linear minimization oracles
(LMOs) over non-Euclidean norm balls, capturing neural network structure in
ways traditional algorithms cannot. Yet, no principled distributed framework
exists for these methods, and communication bottlenecks remain unaddressed. The
very few distributed variants are heuristic, with no convergence guarantees in
sight. We introduce EF21-Muon, the first communication-efficient, non-Euclidean
LMO-based optimizer with rigorous convergence guarantees. EF21-Muon supports
stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error
feedback-marking the first extension of error feedback beyond the Euclidean
setting. It recovers Muon/Scion/Gluon when compression is off and specific
norms are chosen, providing the first efficient distributed implementation of
this powerful family. Our theory covers non-Euclidean smooth and the more
general $(L^0, L^1)$-smooth setting, matching best-known Euclidean rates and
enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices. We further extend the
analysis to layer-wise (generalized) smoothness regimes, capturing the
anisotropic structure of deep networks. Experiments on NanoGPT benchmarking
EF21-Muon against uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon demonstrate up to $7\times$
communication savings with no accuracy degradation.

### [185] [Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine (PIELM) for Tunnelling-Induced Soil-Pile Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00698)
*Fu-Chen Guo,Pei-Zhi Zhuang,Fei Ren,Hong-Ya Yue,He Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions, combining physics-based ODEs with measured data for rapid training and accurate predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient physics-informed machine learning approach for real-time monitoring and safety assessment of pile foundations during tunneling, addressing the need for intelligent early-warning systems in geotechnical engineering.

Method: Models pile as Euler-Bernoulli beam and soil as Pasternak foundation, formulating soil-pile interaction as fourth-order ODE. Combines physics-informed component with data-driven component in ELM network, trained within 1 second using least squares method.

Result: Validated against BEM and FDM methods. Parametric studies show optimal data placement at positions with significant pile deflection gradients (pile tip/top and near tunneling zones). Approach demonstrates high accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: PIELM framework effectively combines physics and data for tunneling-induced soil-pile interaction analysis, showing great potential for real-time monitoring, safety assessment, and intelligent early-warning systems in geotechnical engineering.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and
physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a
physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing
tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an
Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak
foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order
ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed
component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven
component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme
learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least
squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element
method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried
out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring
locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that
monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile
deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling
zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed
and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The
proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety
assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning
systems in geotechnical engineering.

*Uvini Ranaweera,Bawun Mawitagama,Sanduni Liyanage,Sandupa Keshan,Tiloka de Silva,Supun Hewawalpita*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores automated document classification for digital development interventions using multiple ML algorithms and a One vs Rest approach to optimize performance on imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated document classification is needed due to growing digital databases, but models often perform poorly across different datasets due to contextual differences. Digital development interventions represent an emerging field where NLP can improve how organizations report their work.

Method: Used multiple ML algorithms (Decision Trees, k-NN, SVM, AdaBoost, SGD, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) on a public document database of digital development interventions across 12 categories. Employed oversampling for class imbalance and adopted One vs Rest approach instead of traditional multiclass classification.

Result: Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The study found that data quantity alone doesn't determine performance; class similarity and dissimilarity are also crucial factors.

Conclusion: The One vs Rest approach combined with multiple ML algorithms provides optimized classification performance for digital development intervention documents, with class characteristics being as important as data volume for model effectiveness.

Abstract: Automated document classification is a trending topic in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) due to the extensive growth in digital databases. However, a
model that fits well for a specific classification task might perform weakly
for another dataset due to differences in the context. Thus, training and
evaluating several models is necessary to optimise the results. This study
employs a publicly available document database on worldwide digital development
interventions categorised under twelve areas. Since digital interventions are
still emerging, utilising NLP in the field is relatively new. Given the
exponential growth of digital interventions, this research has a vast scope for
improving how digital-development-oriented organisations report their work. The
paper examines the classification performance of Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector
Machine, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, and Logistic
Regression. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are utilised to evaluate
the performance of these models, while oversampling is used to address the
class-imbalanced nature of the dataset. Deviating from the traditional approach
of fitting a single model for multiclass classification, this paper
investigates the One vs Rest approach to build a combined model that optimises
the performance. The study concludes that the amount of data is not the sole
factor affecting the performance; features like similarity within classes and
dissimilarity among classes are also crucial.

*Alessio Cristofoletto,Cesare Rollo,Giovanni Birolo,Piero Fariselli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepFHT combines deep neural networks with first hitting time distributions from stochastic processes to model survival analysis, representing time-to-event as diffusion processes reaching boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an interpretable survival analysis framework that captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional hazards, bridging stochastic process theory with deep learning.

Method: Couples neural networks with FHT distributions, mapping inputs to physical parameters (initial condition, drift, diffusion) of latent diffusion processes like Brownian motion.

Result: Achieves predictive accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods while providing physics-based interpretable parameterization that reveals feature-risk relationships.

Conclusion: The integration of stochastic process theory and deep learning offers a principled approach for modeling survival phenomena in complex systems with interpretable parameters.

Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural
networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process
theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion
process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to
physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and
diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift
and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and
captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.
  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival
models, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive
accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a
physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation
between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory
and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena
in complex systems.

*Marco Bagatella,Matteo Pirotta,Ahmed Touati,Alessandro Lazaric,Andrea Tirinzoni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TD-JEPA enables unsupervised RL by learning latent representations through temporal difference learning, allowing zero-shot optimization of any reward function at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent prediction methods in RL are limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or on-policy data. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by using TD learning to capture long-term latent dynamics across multiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions.

Method: TD-JEPA trains state and task encoders, a policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and parameterized policies directly in latent space using temporal difference learning on offline transitions.

Result: Empirically, TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench, particularly excelling in zero-shot RL from pixels.

Conclusion: TD-JEPA successfully enables unsupervised RL with zero-shot reward optimization by learning predictive latent representations through TD learning, theoretically avoiding collapse and capturing low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics.

Abstract: Latent prediction--where agents learn by predicting their own latents--has
emerged as a powerful paradigm for training general representations in machine
learning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to
define auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and
unsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods
are typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or
on-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning
enables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across
multiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we
introduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations
into unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a
policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies
directly in latent space. This enables zero-shot optimization of any reward
function at test time. Theoretically, we show that an idealized variant of
TD-JEPA avoids collapse with proper initialization, and learns encoders that
capture a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, while the
predictor recovers their successor features in latent space. Empirically,
TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion,
navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench,
especially in the challenging setting of zero-shot RL from pixels.

*Nouha Karaouli,Denis Coquenet,Elisa Fromont,Martial Mermillod,Marina Reyboz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time series foundation models have limited zero-shot capabilities tied to their pretraining domains and don't consistently outperform smaller dedicated models despite larger size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether foundation models, which work well for language and vision, are equally effective for time series data given its inherent diversity.

Method: Used forecasting as downstream task to evaluate time series foundation models' zero-shot capabilities and fine-tuning performance compared to smaller dedicated models.

Result: Foundation models' zero-shot performance is domain-dependent, and fine-tuned versions don't consistently provide substantial improvements over smaller task-specific models relative to their computational costs.

Conclusion: Time series data's diversity makes it less suitable for foundation models compared to language and vision domains, questioning the value of large foundation models for time series tasks.

Abstract: Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with
strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when
fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language
and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time
series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We
demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the
zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly
influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on.
Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned
foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results,
relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller,
dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.

TL;DR: LEAP is a new trainable local structural positional encoding for graphs that combines differentiable approximations of Euler Characteristic Transform and its local variant to address limitations of standard message-passing neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) face theoretical and practical limitations in graph learning tasks, and graph positional encoding has emerged as a promising direction to overcome these limitations.

Method: Proposes LEAP, an end-to-end trainable local structural positional encoding that combines differentiable approximation of Euler Characteristic Transform (DECT) and its local variant (l-ECT) to capture geometric-topological features of graphs.

Result: Evaluated on multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic task designed to test topological feature extraction capability. Results show LEAP-based encodings perform effectively in capturing structural information.

Conclusion: LEAP-based encodings demonstrate strong potential as powerful components for graph representation learning pipelines, effectively addressing limitations of standard MPNNs through geometric-topological feature extraction.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) largely rely on the message-passing paradigm,
where nodes iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors. Yet,
standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented
theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has
emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable
geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this
work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its
local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local
structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world
datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract
topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based
encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.

### [191] [Downgrade to Upgrade: Optimizer Simplification Enhances Robustness in LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00761)
*Yicheng Lang,Yihua Zhang,Chongyu Fan,Changsheng Wang,Jinghan Jia,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM unlearning often lacks robustness against post-training manipulations. This paper shows that using lower-grade optimizers (zeroth-order or compressed-gradient methods) improves robustness by converging to harder-to-disturb loss landscape basins, and proposes a hybrid optimizer combining first-order and zeroth-order updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fragility of LLM unlearning effects, where post-unlearning manipulations like weight quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize intended forgetting, by investigating the role of optimizer choice in shaping unlearning robustness.

Method: Investigate how optimizer 'grade' (zeroth-order, first-order, second-order) affects unlearning robustness. Propose a hybrid optimizer combining first-order and zeroth-order updates to preserve unlearning efficacy while enhancing robustness against post-training perturbations.

Result: Downgrading optimizers (using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants) leads to stronger robustness by encouraging convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape. The proposed hybrid optimizer achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning quality on MUSE and WMDP benchmarks.

Conclusion: Optimizer choice plays a crucial role in LLM unlearning robustness, with lower-grade optimizers providing natural advantages. The hybrid optimizer approach successfully balances unlearning efficacy with enhanced robustness against post-training manipulations.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence
of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its
utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing
privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning
effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight
quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.
Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives
by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take
a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent
of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We
show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it
exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order
(gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the
resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,
such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,
gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While
these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage
convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby
resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with
randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust
unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that
combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy
while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP
benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our
approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning
quality.

*Youngbin Choi,Minjong Lee,Saemi Moon,Seunghyuk Cho,Chaehyeon Chung,MoonJeong Park,Dongwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In-place feedback allows users to directly edit LLM responses, enabling more precise corrections and better performance with 79.1% fewer tokens compared to conventional multi-turn feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-turn feedback paradigms in LLMs often fail to reliably integrate user feedback, leading to inconsistent improvements in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduces in-place feedback where users directly edit the LLM's previous response, and the model conditions on this modified response to generate revisions.

Result: In-place feedback achieves better performance on reasoning benchmarks while using 79.1% fewer tokens, and resolves core limitations of multi-turn feedback by enabling precise error correction.

Conclusion: In-place feedback offers a more natural and effective mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks compared to conventional feedback approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of
multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on
user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require
complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new
messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent
improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction
paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model
conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical
evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place
feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback
while using $79.1\%$ fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled
environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core
limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback
precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and
sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These
findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective
mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks.

*Bastien Morel,Clément Moulin-Frier,Pascal Barla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for efficiently exploring complex systems to maximize pattern diversity within user-defined constraints, enabling interactive exploration while maintaining global diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex systems generate diverse patterns useful for science and art, but exploration is challenging due to large parameter spaces, non-linear mappings, and user expectations for specific patterns.

Method: Design choices and implementation that allow users to express explicit, system-agnostic constraints defining regions of interest, then efficiently maximize pattern diversity within these constraints through sample-efficient exploration.

Result: The approach enables interactive exploration of complex systems that maximizes constrained diversity (diversity within user's region of interest) while maintaining global diversity across the entire parameter space.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the challenges of exploring complex systems by incorporating user expectations through explicit constraints, enabling efficient discovery of diverse patterns in targeted regions of interest.

Abstract: The diversity of patterns that emerge from complex systems motivates their
use for scientific or artistic purposes. When exploring these systems, the
challenges faced are the size of the parameter space and the strongly
non-linear mapping between parameters and emerging patterns. In addition,
artists and scientists who explore complex systems do so with an expectation of
particular patterns. Taking these expectations into account adds a new set of
challenges, which the exploration process must address. We provide design
choices and their implementation to address these challenges; enabling the
maximization of the diversity of patterns discovered in the user's region of
interest -- which we call the constrained diversity -- in a sample-efficient
manner. The region of interest is expressed in the form of explicit
constraints. These constraints are formulated by the user in a system-agnostic
way, and their addition enables interactive system exploration leading to
constrained diversity, while maintaining global diversity.

Result: Significantly improves generation of valid and realistic molecules, reduces structural artifacts, and outperforms baseline in molecular pre-filtering realism.

Conclusion: Combining reinforcement learning with molecular fingerprints effectively generates chemically relevant molecular structures.

Abstract: The efficient exploration of chemical space remains a central challenge, as
many generative models still produce unstable or non-synthesizable compounds.
To address these limitations, we present EvoMol-RL, a significant extension of
the EvoMol evolutionary algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning to
guide molecular mutations based on local structural context. By leveraging
Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs), EvoMol-RL learns context-aware
mutation policies that prioritize chemically plausible transformations. This
approach significantly improves the generation of valid and realistic
molecules, reducing the frequency of structural artifacts and enhancing
optimization performance. The results demonstrate that EvoMol-RL consistently
outperforms its baseline in molecular pre-filtering realism. These results
emphasize the effectiveness of combining reinforcement learning with molecular
fingerprints to generate chemically relevant molecular structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online minimization of polarization and disagreement in opinion dynamics using bandit algorithms with incomplete information about innate opinions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the realistic online setting where innate opinions are unknown and must be learned sequentially, unlike prior static approaches with full knowledge.

Method: Two-stage algorithm based on low-rank matrix bandits: subspace estimation to identify low-dimensional structure, then linear bandit algorithm within the compact representation.

Result: Achieves $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret over time horizon T, significantly outperforming linear bandit baseline in both regret and running time.

Conclusion: Successfully connects algorithmic interventions on social media platforms with multi-armed bandit theory, providing effective online learning approach for polarization minimization.

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing polarization and disagreement in the
Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model under incomplete information. Unlike
prior work that assumes a static setting with full knowledge of users' innate
opinions, we address the more realistic online setting where innate opinions
are unknown and must be learned through sequential observations. This novel
setting, which naturally mirrors periodic interventions on social media
platforms, is formulated as a regret minimization problem, establishing a key
connection between algorithmic interventions on social media platforms and
theory of multi-armed bandits. In our formulation, a learner observes only a
scalar feedback of the overall polarization and disagreement after an
intervention. For this novel bandit problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm
based on low-rank matrix bandits. The algorithm first performs subspace
estimation to identify an underlying low-dimensional structure, and then
employs a linear bandit algorithm within the compact dimensional representation
derived from the estimated subspace. We prove that our algorithm achieves an $
\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative regret over any time horizon $T$.
Empirical results validate that our algorithm significantly outperforms a
linear bandit baseline in terms of both cumulative regret and running time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GFlowNets to improve sampling of high-reward samples while maintaining diversity, using PUCT for exploration-exploitation balance and controllable greediness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GFlowNets sampling strategies overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions, creating a need to improve high-reward sample generation without sacrificing diversity.

Method: Integration of enhanced MCTS into GFlowNets sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide generation toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, with controllable greediness mechanism.

Result: The method accelerates discovery of high-reward regions and continuously generates high-reward samples while preserving the diversity of the generative distribution.

Conclusion: The proposed MCTS-enhanced GFlowNets approach successfully enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing exploration and reward-driven guidance.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for
generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample
from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike
conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize
optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and
reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes
them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial
optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to
overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples,
particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore,
improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing
diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we
integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets
sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation
toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to
balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a
controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method
enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing
exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our
method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but
also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity
of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at

Motivation: To investigate the robustness of Time Series Foundation Models to continual adaptation and explore their vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Using synthetic datasets with varying degrees of periodic structure, measuring the trade-off between adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge through sequential fine-tuning.

Result: Fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks but causes significant degradation on previously learned ones, demonstrating catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: TSFMs face a fundamental stability-plasticity dilemma when adapted sequentially, highlighting the need for better continual learning approaches.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown promising zero-shot
generalization across diverse forecasting tasks. However, their robustness to
continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned
sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with
varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between
adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal
that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes
significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental
stability-plasticity dilemma.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes learning dynamic guidance weights for classifier-free guidance (CFG) in diffusion models, making them functions of conditioning, denoising time, and target time to improve distributional alignment while maintaining perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static guidance weights in CFG improve visual quality but harm distributional alignment with the target conditional distribution. The authors aim to better approximate the true conditional distribution while maintaining perceptual improvements.

Method: Learn continuous guidance weights ω_c,(s,t) as functions of conditioning c, current time t, and target time s by minimizing distributional mismatch between noised samples from true conditional distribution and guided diffusion samples. Extend to reward-guided sampling using reward functions R(x_0,c).

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on low-dimensional examples and high-dimensional image generation, showing FID improvements. In text-to-image tasks, CLIP score-based reward functions improved image-prompt alignment.

Conclusion: Dynamic guidance weights learned as continuous functions of conditioning and temporal parameters can better approximate target distributions while maintaining perceptual quality, with applications to reward-guided sampling for improved alignment.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving the
perceptual quality of samples from conditional diffusion models. It operates by
linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a
guidance weight $\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve
visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional
alignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution,
we instead learn guidance weights $\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous
functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the
time $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the
distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional
distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our
framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions
tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a
conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on
low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we
observe improvements in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) for image
generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward
function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve
image-prompt alignment.

*Luckeciano C. Melo,Alessandro Abate,Yarin Gal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAPO is a curvature-aware policy optimization method that stabilizes RL training for LLMs by identifying and masking unstable samples, achieving up to 30x sample efficiency improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy gradient methods in RL for LLMs suffer from optimization instability, forcing conservative hyperparameter choices that increase computational costs and reduce sample efficiency.

Method: Formalizes policy gradients with second-order geometry, tracks curvature information during updates, and uses data selection to mask samples contributing to unstable updates.

Result: CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning regimes, achieves up to 30x sample efficiency improvement over standard GRPO, with minimal intervention (rejecting <8% of tokens).

Conclusion: Curvature-aware optimization enables more stable and sample-efficient RL training for LLMs, unleashing scalable post-training capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning, particularly through policy gradient methods, has
played a central role in enabling reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models. However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting
remains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to
conservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more
training samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models
for reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them
into training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes
scalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic
optimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of
second-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that
tracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further
employ this framework to design interventions in the optimization process
through data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy
Optimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and
masks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees
under realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we
empirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning
regimes where baselines catastrophically fail. With minimal intervention
(rejecting fewer than 8% of tokens), CAPO achieves up to 30x improvement in
sample efficiency over standard GRPO for LLM reasoning.

*Chao-Kai Chiang,Takashi Ishida,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM routing as contextual dueling bandits with Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT) for model embeddings, enabling efficient routing that balances performance and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to select best LLM for each query while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost efficiently.

Method: Formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits with pairwise preference feedback. Introduce CCFT for model embeddings using contrastive fine-tuning with categorical weighting. Use Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits (FGTS.CDB) algorithm.

Result: Achieved lower cumulative regret and faster convergence on RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets, with better robustness and performance-cost balance than OpenAI embedding baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively solve LLM routing problem with efficient adaptation and cost-performance balance.

Abstract: We study LLM routing, the problem of selecting the best model for each query
while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost. We
formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise
preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding
label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we
introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning
method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive
fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical
instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits
(FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose
four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model
quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the
RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods
achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness
and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose
OpenAI embedding model.

TL;DR: The paper argues that mechanistic interpretability methods should be treated as statistical estimators and shows that EAP-IG circuit discovery exhibits high variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters, questioning its reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish scientific rigor in mechanistic interpretability by evaluating the statistical reliability and stability of circuit discovery methods, moving beyond black-box performance metrics.

Method: Systematic stability analysis of EAP-IG circuit discovery method using controlled perturbations including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing, hyperparameter variation, and injected noise in causal analysis.

Result: EAP-IG exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters across diverse models and tasks, questioning the stability of its findings.

Conclusion: Advocates for routine reporting of stability metrics in interpretability research to promote more rigorous and statistically grounded science.

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond
black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal
computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by
identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the
scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings.
In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit
discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of
variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a
systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method:
EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite
of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing,
hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself.
Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG
exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters,
questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a
set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine
reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically
grounded science of interpretability.

TL;DR: A WGAN-based population synthesis model that handles incomplete microsamples using mask matrices, achieving comparable results to models trained on complete data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address missing information in microsamples due to privacy concerns or data collection constraints, enabling population synthesis with incomplete datasets.

Method: Uses Wasserstein GAN with mask matrices to represent missing values, training on incomplete microsamples and comparing with models trained on complete data using Swedish national travel survey.

Result: Successfully generates synthetic populations that closely resemble both models trained with complete data and the actual population dataset.

Conclusion: Provides a robust solution for population synthesis with incomplete data, demonstrating the potential of deep generative models in advancing population synthesis capabilities.

Abstract: This paper presents a population synthesis model that utilizes the
Wasserstein Generative-Adversarial Network (WGAN) for training on incomplete
microsamples. By using a mask matrix to represent missing values, the study
proposes a WGAN training algorithm that lets the model learn from a training
dataset that has some missing information. The proposed method aims to address
the challenge of missing information in microsamples on one or more attributes
due to privacy concerns or data collection constraints. The paper contrasts
WGAN models trained on incomplete microsamples with those trained on complete
microsamples, creating a synthetic population. We conducted a series of
evaluations of the proposed method using a Swedish national travel survey. We
validate the efficacy of the proposed method by generating synthetic
populations from all the models and comparing them to the actual population
dataset. The results from the experiments showed that the proposed methodology
successfully generates synthetic data that closely resembles a model trained
with complete data as well as the actual population. The paper contributes to
the field by providing a robust solution for population synthesis with
incomplete data, opening avenues for future research, and highlighting the
potential of deep generative models in advancing population synthesis
capabilities.

*Thiziri Nait Saada,Louis Bethune,Michal Klein,David Grangier,Marco Cuturi,Pierre Ablin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF) improves downstream task performance but paradoxically doesn't enhance language modeling on high-quality data, as it implicitly filters the reference dataset. The method differs fundamentally from synthetic quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale models are trained on web-crawled datasets with mixed quality documents, making data filtering essential. CQF is a popular method that uses binary classification to filter data, but its effectiveness and underlying mechanisms need deeper analysis.

Method: Analyze Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF) which trains a binary classifier to distinguish pretraining data from a small high-quality set, assigns quality scores, and retains top-scoring documents. Compare with models trained on synthetic data of increasing quality via random token permutations.

Result: CQF improves downstream task performance but does not enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. This paradox occurs because CQF implicitly filters the high-quality reference dataset itself. CQF shows different trends compared to synthetic quality improvements.

Conclusion: CQF may not capture a meaningful notion of data quality as previously assumed, challenging the conventional understanding of this filtering method's effectiveness.

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing
documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method
is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier
to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It
assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's
score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of
CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not
necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain
this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset
as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those
trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token
permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view
that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

### [204] [Target Population Synthesis using CT-GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00871)
*Tanay Rastogi,Daniel Jonsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Conditional Tabular GAN (CT-GAN) for population synthesis in transportation planning, either standalone or hybrid with FBS-CO, showing CT-GAN performs best for generating realistic populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deterministic population synthesis methods face challenges with high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues when generating populations for target scenarios in transportation planning.

Method: Uses CT-GAN deep generative model to create target populations directly from marginal constraints or through hybrid approach combining CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO).

Result: Standalone CT-GAN performs best, generating realistic populations matching single-variable distributions but struggles with multi-variable relationships. Hybrid model improves over FBS-CO by using CT-GAN for base population generation refined by FBS-CO.

Conclusion: CT-GAN is effective for target population synthesis, and deep generative models can be successfully integrated with conventional techniques to enhance performance.

Abstract: Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban
planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well
as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing
fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these
deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as
handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly
when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how
a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial
Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from
a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines
CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The
research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel
survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the
stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the
hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match
single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships
between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved
performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a
descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with
target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an
effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative
models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to
enhance their performance.

Conclusion: Visual analytics provides a scalable framework for data quality assessment and highlights the critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems, enabling improved accuracy and generalizability of forecasting models.

Abstract: High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks,
sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal
inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper
presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using
visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The
dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series
plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and
anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the
modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret
data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality
assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a
Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from
nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic
data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the
accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated
Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a
scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the
critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GreenLightningAI (GLAI) is a new architectural block that separates structural knowledge (ReLU activation patterns) from quantitative knowledge (weights/biases), enabling faster training while maintaining MLP capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of conventional MLPs by disentangling structural and quantitative knowledge, which are typically entangled during training, leading to computational overhead.

Method: GLAI fixes the structural knowledge once stabilized and reformulates MLPs as path combinations, optimizing only the quantitative component while preserving universal approximation capabilities.

Result: Reduces training time by ~40% on average while matching or exceeding MLP accuracy with equivalent parameters across diverse experimental setups.

Conclusion: GLAI establishes a new design principle for efficient neural network blocks that can replace MLPs in various applications and potentially integrate into large-scale architectures like Transformers.

Abstract: In this work we introduce GreenLightningAI (GLAI), a new architectural block
designed as an alternative to conventional MLPs. The central idea is to
separate two types of knowledge that are usually entangled during training: (i)
*structural knowledge*, encoded by the stable activation patterns induced by
ReLU activations; and (ii) *quantitative knowledge*, carried by the numerical
weights and biases. By fixing the structure once stabilized, GLAI reformulates
the MLP as a combination of paths, where only the quantitative component is
optimized. This reformulation retains the universal approximation capabilities
of MLPs, yet achieves a more efficient training process, reducing training time
by ~40% on average across the cases examined in this study. Crucially, GLAI is
not just another classifier, but a generic block that can replace MLPs wherever
they are used, from supervised heads with frozen backbones to projection layers
in self-supervised learning or few-shot classifiers. Across diverse
experimental setups, GLAI consistently matches or exceeds the accuracy of MLPs
with an equivalent number of parameters, while converging faster. Overall, GLAI
establishes a new design principle that opens a direction for future
integration into large-scale architectures such as Transformers, where MLP
blocks dominate the computational footprint.

TL;DR: The paper shows that mean absolute error is theoretically better than mean squared error for controlling policy suboptimality in reinforcement learning, and that cross-entropy losses outperform squared loss in linear RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how different loss functions impact value-based reinforcement learning methods and their underlying prediction objectives.

Method: Theoretical analysis comparing mean absolute error vs mean squared error for policy suboptimality control, and empirical evaluation of different loss functions in linear reinforcement learning.

Result: Mean absolute error is theoretically superior to mean squared error for controlling policy suboptimality gap. Cross-entropy losses (binary and categorical) aligned with mean absolute error outperform squared loss aligned with mean squared error in linear RL.

Conclusion: Loss function choice significantly impacts RL performance, with cross-entropy losses showing empirical advantages over traditional squared loss in value-based methods.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the loss function in value-based
methods for reinforcement learning through an analysis of underlying prediction
objectives. We theoretically show that mean absolute error is a better
prediction objective than the traditional mean squared error for controlling
the learned policy's suboptimality gap. Furthermore, we present results that
different loss functions are better aligned with these different regression
objectives: binary and categorical cross-entropy losses with the mean absolute
error and squared loss with the mean squared error. We then provide empirical
evidence that algorithms minimizing these cross-entropy losses can outperform
those based on the squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature selection is crucial for gene expression data analysis to enhance classification performance and reduce computational costs for high-dimensional datasets.

Method: Proposes BoMGene, a hybrid method integrating Boruta and mRMR feature selection techniques, tested on 25 gene expression datasets using SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and GBM classifiers.

Result: The Boruta-mRMR combination reduces feature count compared to mRMR alone, speeds up training time, and maintains or improves classification accuracy over individual methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach shows clear advantages in accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene expression data analysis.

Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial step in analyzing gene expression data,
enhancing classification performance, and reducing computational costs for
high-dimensional datasets. This paper proposes BoMGene, a hybrid feature
selection method that effectively integrates two popular techniques: Boruta and
Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). The method aims to optimize the
feature space and enhance classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted
on 25 publicly available gene expression datasets, employing widely used
classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost (XGB),
and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The results show that using the
Boruta-mRMR combination cuts down the number of features chosen compared to
just using mRMR, which helps to speed up training time while keeping or even
improving classification accuracy compared to using individual feature
selection methods. The proposed approach demonstrates clear advantages in
accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene

TL;DR: RiskPO introduces risk-based policy optimization to address entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains in LLM training by emphasizing rare but informative reasoning paths through mixed Value-at-Risk objectives and question bundling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevailing mean-based methods like GRPO suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains by overemphasizing high-probability outputs while neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths.

Method: Proposes Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO) using Mixed Value-at-Risk objectives that integrate weighted attention over multiple reward distribution regions, plus a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions for enriched feedback.

Result: Achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing GRPO and variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics.

Conclusion: Risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities by alleviating entropy collapse and promoting exploration.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a
central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however,
prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that
these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while
neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges,
we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical
mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce
a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over
multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient
signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We
further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into
bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and
informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse
update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically,
RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical
reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing
GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results
demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective
paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

*Xin-Qiang Cai,Wei Wang,Feng Liu,Tongliang Liu,Gang Niu,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR trains policies using automated verifiers instead of human labeling. Binary rewards cause false negatives (rejecting correct answers) and false positives (accepting wrong ones). The paper proposes two correction algorithms for verifier errors and shows they improve training performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of binary rewards in RLVR systems, which introduce false negatives and false positives due to verifier unreliability, leading to suboptimal policy training.

Method: Model verifier as stochastic reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. Derive two correction algorithms: backward correction (de-biases observed reward) and forward correction (reweights score-function terms). Implement as lightweight hooks in GRPO-based RLVR pipeline.

Result: Both corrections improve over uncorrected training across models and datasets. Forward variant converges faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Lightweight LLM verifier estimating FN rate online outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed correction algorithms effectively mitigate verifier unreliability in RLVR systems, with forward correction showing superior performance and stability, enabling practical appeal mechanisms for improved training.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against
automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to
verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during
training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives}
(rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting
incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct
fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical
$\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large
language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single
adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We
formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic
reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive
two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward}
correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an
\textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a
\textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the
expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it
requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group
relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on
math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both
corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges
faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical
appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate
online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared
with other state-of-the-art contenders.

TL;DR: RECAP is a reinforcement learning method that teaches large reasoning models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe responses, improving safety alignment without additional training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models lack critical reasoning about safety alignment and are easily biased by flawed premises in their chain-of-thought reasoning.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with synthetically generated counter-aligned chain-of-thought prefills mixed with standard prompts, requiring no additional training modifications.

Result: Substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness, reduces overrefusal, preserves core reasoning capability, and maintains inference token budget. Models engage in more self-reflection and remain robust under adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: RECAP provides an effective post-training method for robust safety alignment that maintains model performance while significantly enhancing safety robustness against various attack scenarios.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) "think" by generating structured
chain-of-thought (CoT) before producing a final answer, yet they still lack the
ability to reason critically about safety alignment and are easily biased when
a flawed premise is injected into their thought process. We propose RECAP
(Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled
reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches
models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and
helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated
counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional
training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness,
reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while
maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained
models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under
adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override
their reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the assumption that GRPO requires large group sizes for stable training, which incurs substantial computational costs.

Method: Reframe GRPO as contrastive learning, connect it to DPO, and investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO) with rigorous theoretical analysis.

Result: 2-GRPO achieves performance on par with 16-GRPO using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reduces training time by over 70%.

Conclusion: GRPO can be effectively implemented with minimal group sizes, significantly reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement
learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is
commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable
training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing
GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection
to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success,
we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration
previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to
validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par
with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time
by over 70%.

TL;DR: Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM) enables few-step generation on Riemannian manifolds using covariant derivatives and exponential maps, with theoretical equivalence between distillation and training variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing consistency models work well on Euclidean domains like images but face challenges on Riemannian manifolds due to curved geometry, limiting their application to non-Euclidean spaces.

Method: Proposes RCM using covariant derivatives and exponential-map parameterization, with discrete/continuous-time training objectives and simplified variants (RCD and RCT) that avoid complex differential calculations.

Result: RCM achieves superior generative quality in few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds including flat-tori, spheres, and SO(3), demonstrating practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: RCM successfully extends consistency modeling to Riemannian manifolds while respecting intrinsic geometric constraints, with theoretical foundations and practical performance across diverse manifolds.

Abstract: Consistency models are a class of generative models that enable few-step
generation for diffusion and flow matching models. While consistency models
have achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their
applications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved
geometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM),
which, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while
respecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian
geometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based
parameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and
continuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical
equivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency
distillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal
vector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the
conditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training
objective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential
calculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for
interpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through
extensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in
few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori,
spheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3).

*Maximilian Gollwitzer,Felix Dietrich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S-SWIM: A novel algorithm for training Spiking Neural Networks using Random Feature Methods, avoiding gradient approximation of spike functions and achieving high performance on time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs are energy-efficient alternatives to ANNs but difficult to train due to non-differentiable spiking mechanisms and gradient propagation challenges.

Method: Adapt Random Feature Methods from ANNs to Spike Response Model SNNs, creating S-SWIM algorithm that trains SNNs without spike function gradient approximation.

Result: S-SWIM achieves high accuracies on time series forecasting as standalone strategy and serves as effective initialization for gradient-based training, outperforming random weight sampling.

Conclusion: S-SWIM provides a fast, high-performance, interpretable approach for SNN training that addresses gradient approximation challenges and enables effective initialization for subsequent training.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently
received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative
to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and
sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train
with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking
non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random
Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response
Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation
of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven,
fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of
SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We
provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical
experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series
forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation
strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that
our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.

*Tavor Z. Baharav,Spyros Dragazis,Aldo Pacchiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel algorithm for sequential medical testing that minimizes costly diagnostic tests while guaranteeing error rates below a specified tolerance, using logistic models and data-driven thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce healthcare costs by minimizing expensive diagnostic tests while maintaining patient safety through guaranteed error rate constraints in medical screening scenarios.

Method: Developed an algorithm that interleaves label collection and distribution estimation, computes conservative data-driven thresholds on logistic scores to decide when testing is necessary, and estimates both model parameters and context distribution.

Result: The procedure guarantees with high probability that misclassification rates do not exceed target tolerance, requiring only O(√T) excess tests compared to an oracle baseline that knows true parameters and distributions.

Conclusion: Establishes first no-regret guarantees for error-constrained logistic testing, providing practical cost-sensitive medical screening solution with theoretical safety guarantees and efficient parameter estimation.

Abstract: We study the problem of sequentially testing individuals for a binary disease
outcome whose true risk is governed by an unknown logistic model. At each
round, a patient arrives with feature vector $x_t$, and the decision maker may
either pay to administer a (noiseless) diagnostic test--revealing the true
label--or skip testing and predict the patient's disease status based on their
feature vector and prior history. Our goal is to minimize the total number of
costly tests required while guaranteeing that the fraction of
misclassifications does not exceed a prespecified error tolerance $\alpha$,
with probability at least $1-\delta$. To address this, we develop a novel
algorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to
estimate both $\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a
conservative, data-driven threshold $\tau_t$ on the logistic score
$|x_t^\top\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary. We prove that, with
probability at least $1-\delta$, our procedure does not exceed the target
misclassification rate, and requires only $O(\sqrt{T})$ excess tests compared
to the oracle baseline that knows both $\theta^{*}$ and the patient feature
distribution $P$. This establishes the first no-regret guarantees for
error-constrained logistic testing, with direct applications to cost-sensitive
medical screening. Simulations corroborate our theoretical guarantees, showing
that in practice our procedure efficiently estimates $\theta^{*}$ while
retaining safety guarantees, and does not require too many excess tests.

*Zeru Shi,Yingjia Wan,Zhenting Wang,Qifan Wang,Fan Yang,Elisa Kreiss,Ruixiang Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explains why adding meaningless tokens before queries improves LLM reasoning and proposes ARM - a lightweight inference-time technique that redistributes activations to achieve similar benefits without altering input sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the puzzling phenomenon where inserting meaningless tokens before queries consistently enhances LLM reasoning performance, and to develop a more principled method that achieves similar gains.

Method: Proposes Activation Redistribution Module (ARM) - a lightweight inference-time technique that identifies near-zero activations after non-linear functions and shifts them outward, redistributing MLP layer activations to suppress weak signals and promote stronger ones.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures show ARM consistently improves LLM performance on reasoning tasks while requiring minimal implementation effort.

Conclusion: The work provides both a mechanistic explanation for the benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique (ARM) that harnesses activation redistribution to improve LLM performance without input sequence modifications.

Abstract: Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of
meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM
reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this
phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that
allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements
arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near
zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations
increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by
suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones.
Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module
(ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations
directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies
near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward,
implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a
controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model
architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on
reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement.
Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected
benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that
harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.

*Yongcheng Zeng,Zexu Sun,Bokai Ji,Erxue Min,Hengyi Cai,Shuaiqiang Wang,Dawei Yin,Haifeng Zhang,Xu Chen,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CurES is an efficient curriculum learning method for LLMs that optimizes prompt selection and rollout allocation using reinforcement learning gradient optimization, achieving significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing curriculum learning methods for LLMs fail to adequately account for prompt difficulty variations and use simplistic filtering mechanisms, leading to computational inefficiency.

Method: Approaches the problem from RL gradient optimization perspective, identifies key factors (prompt selection and rollout allocation), and proposes CurES with Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize computational overhead.

Result: Outperforms GRPO by +3.30 points with 1.5B model and +4.82 points with 7B model, and shows faster convergence compared to baselines.

Conclusion: CurES provides a systematic and theoretically grounded approach to improve LLM training efficiency through optimized curriculum learning.

Abstract: Curriculum learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the training efficiency
of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. However, existing methods
often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on
simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow
criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we
approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient
optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to
improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors
influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the
allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical
analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the
convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout
quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates.
Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that
accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize
computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and
\textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally,
CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.

*Vikas Dwivedi,Enrico Schiassi,Monica Sigovan,Bruno Sixou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gated X-TFC is a novel framework that improves on Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC) by using a soft, learned domain decomposition with differentiable logistic gates to handle sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems, achieving superior accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs and related methods struggle with sharp gradients in boundary value problems, requiring complex domain decomposition with interface penalties. X-TFC avoids multi-objective optimization but remains inefficient for boundary layers and incompatible with decomposition.

Method: Proposes Gated X-TFC framework using a differentiable logistic gate that dynamically adapts RBF kernel widths across domains, eliminating interface penalties. Includes operator-conditioned meta-learning layer for probabilistic mapping from PDE parameters to optimal gate configurations.

Result: On 1D convection-diffusion benchmark: order-of-magnitude lower error than standard X-TFC, 80% fewer collocation points, 66% reduction in training time. Scalable to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions, demonstrated on twin boundary-layer equation and 2D Poisson problem with sharp Gaussian source.

Conclusion: Gated X-TFC provides a simple, accurate, and computationally efficient alternative to PINNs for challenging boundary-layer regimes. Future work will focus on nonlinear problems.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and related methods struggle to
resolve sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems without
resorting to some form of domain decomposition, which often introduce complex
interface penalties. While the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC)
avoids multi-objective optimization by employing exact boundary condition
enforcement, it remains computationally inefficient for boundary layers and
incompatible with decomposition. We propose Gated X-TFC, a novel framework for
both forward and inverse problems, that overcomes these limitations through a
soft, learned domain decomposition. Our method replaces hard interfaces with a
differentiable logistic gate that dynamically adapts radial basis function
(RBF) kernel widths across the domain, eliminating the need for interface
penalties. This approach yields not only superior accuracy but also dramatic
improvements in computational efficiency: on a benchmark one dimensional (1D)
convection-diffusion, Gated X-TFC achieves an order-of-magnitude lower error
than standard X-TFC while using 80 percent fewer collocation points and
reducing training time by 66 percent. In addition, we introduce an
operator-conditioned meta-learning layer that learns a probabilistic mapping
from PDE parameters to optimal gate configurations, enabling fast,
uncertainty-aware warm-starting for new problem instances. We further
demonstrate scalability to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions by solving
a twin boundary-layer equation and a 2D Poisson problem with a sharp Gaussian
source. Overall, Gated X-TFC delivers a simple alternative alternative to PINNs
that is both accurate and computationally efficient for challenging
boundar-layer regimes. Future work will focus on nonlinear problems.

TL;DR: GEM is an open-source environment simulator for LLM-based agents, providing standardized interfaces, diverse environments, and tools to facilitate experience-based learning and accelerate agentic LLM research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The training paradigm for LLMs is shifting from static datasets to experience-based learning through environment interaction, requiring standardized frameworks like OpenAI-Gym for traditional RL.

Method: GEM provides asynchronous vectorized execution, flexible wrappers, diverse environments, integrated tools, and example scripts with five RL frameworks. It also includes baselines using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization.

Result: GEM enables apple-to-apple benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in single- and multi-turn settings, and functions as both training environment and evaluation toolkit.

Conclusion: GEM framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research by providing standardized environment simulation and benchmarking capabilities.

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static
datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via
interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we
introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator
designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional
reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the
environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for
high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also
features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and
single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL
training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across
24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which
-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn
rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple
benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings
using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions
as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this
framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers study secret elicitation - discovering hidden knowledge in AI models that they possess but don't explicitly state. They train LLMs with specific knowledge that influences behavior but is denied when asked directly, then test various black-box and white-box techniques to extract this knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and develop methods for discovering knowledge that AI models possess but intentionally or unintentionally conceal, which is important for AI safety, auditing, and understanding model behavior.

Method: Train three families of LLMs with specific secret knowledge that influences downstream behavior but is denied when asked directly. Test various black-box (prefill attacks) and white-box (logit lens, sparse autoencoders) techniques to extract the hidden knowledge.

Result: Many techniques improved on simple baselines. Prefill attacks (black-box) were most effective in 2/3 settings, while white-box techniques (logit lens and SAEs) performed best in the remaining setting. The study establishes a public benchmark for evaluating secret elicitation methods.

Conclusion: Secret elicitation is possible through various techniques, with effectiveness depending on the specific setting. Both black-box and white-box approaches show promise, providing tools for AI auditing and safety evaluation.

Abstract: We study secret elicitation: discovering knowledge that an AI possesses but
does not explicitly verbalize. As a testbed, we train three families of large
language models (LLMs) to possess specific knowledge that they apply downstream
but deny knowing when asked directly. For example, in one setting, we train an
LLM to generate replies that are consistent with knowing the user is female,
while denying this knowledge when asked directly. We then design various
black-box and white-box secret elicitation techniques and evaluate them based
on whether they can help an LLM auditor successfully guess the secret
knowledge. Many of our techniques improve on simple baselines. Our most
effective techniques (performing best in 2/3 settings) are based on prefill
attacks, a black-box technique where the LLM reveals secret knowledge when
generating a completion from a predefined prefix. In our remaining setting,
white-box techniques based on logit lens and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are
most effective. We release our models and code, establishing a public benchmark
for evaluating secret elicitation methods.

TL;DR: A two-level ensemble model using routine lab tests achieves high accuracy (94.33%) for diabetic retinopathy prediction, outperforming image-based AI and single-level stacking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diabetic retinopathy diagnostic methods rely on resource-intensive eye exams, and image-based AI tools have limitations in early-stage detection, creating need for alternative non-image approaches.

Method: Two-level ensemble model using routine laboratory test results: first stage hyperparameter-tunes and internally stacks base models (Linear SVC, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost), second stage aggregates predictions using Random Forest as meta-learner.

Result: Achieved Accuracy 0.9433, F1 Score 0.9425, Recall 0.9207, Precision 0.9653, ROC-AUC 0.9844, and AUPRC 0.9875, surpassing one-level stacking and FCN baselines.

Conclusion: The hierarchical stacking strategy improves generalization, balances performance across metrics, and offers accurate, interpretable DR risk prediction suitable for clinical settings.

Abstract: Preprint Note: This is the author preprint version of a paper accepted for
presentation at the IISE Annual Conference & Expo 2025. The final version will
appear in the official proceedings.
  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in working-age
adults, and current diagnostic methods rely on resource-intensive eye exams and
specialized equipment. Image-based AI tools have shown limitations in
early-stage detection, motivating the need for alternative approaches. We
propose a non-image-based, two-level ensemble model for DR prediction using
routine laboratory test results. In the first stage, base models (Linear SVC,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) are hyperparameter tuned and
internally stacked across different configurations to optimize metrics such as
accuracy, recall, and precision. In the second stage, predictions are
aggregated using Random Forest as a meta-learner. This hierarchical stacking
strategy improves generalization, balances performance across multiple metrics,
and remains computationally efficient compared to deep learning approaches. The
model achieved Accuracy 0.9433, F1 Score 0.9425, Recall 0.9207, Precision
0.9653, ROC-AUC 0.9844, and AUPRC 0.9875, surpassing one-level stacking and FCN
baselines. These results highlight the model potential for accurate and
interpretable DR risk prediction in clinical settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic reinforcement learning method that uses multiple actors and critics with non-dominated sorting for actor selection, quantile-based ensemble strategy for evaluation, and exploits actors with best skill factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation that few studies have considered architectures with multiple actors together with multiple critics in actor-critic reinforcement learning, despite past studies leveraging multiple critics to enhance policy evaluation accuracy.

Method: MAMC method with three main features: 1) actor selection using non-dominated sorting based on skill and creativity factors, 2) evaluation using quantile-based ensemble strategy for both actors and critics, 3) exploitation of actors with best skill factor.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic based reinforcement learning methods on MuJoCo benchmark, with experimental analysis showing proposed components are effective and empirical analysis validating benefits on complicated problems.

Conclusion: The MAMC method provides stable learning with bounded estimation bias, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and effectiveness for complex reinforcement learning problems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has gathered much attention in recent years due to its
rapid development and rich applications, especially on control systems and
robotics. When tackling real-world applications with reinforcement learning
method, the corresponded Markov decision process may have huge discrete or even
continuous state/action space. Deep reinforcement learning has been studied for
handling these issues through deep learning for years, and one promising branch
is the actor-critic architecture. Many past studies leveraged multiple critics
to enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the
overestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered
the architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This
study proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic
reinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features,
including selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration
with respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics
using a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill
factor. Theoretical analysis proves the learning stability and bounded
estimation bias for the MAMC. The present study examines the performance on a
well-known reinforcement learning benchmark MuJoCo. Experimental results show
that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic
based reinforcement learning methods. Experimental analysis also indicates the
proposed components are effective. Empirical analysis further investigates the
validity of the proposed method, and shows its benefit on complicated problems.

time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and
supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of

interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the
deterministic models with equivalent architecture.

*George Andriopoulos,Zixuan Dong,Bimarsha Adhikari,Keith Ross*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural regression models suffer from performance degradation when they exhibit neural collapse (ID_H < ID_Y), unlike classification where collapse benefits generalization. Performance depends on the relationship between feature intrinsic dimension (ID_H) and target dimension (ID_Y).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why neural collapse degrades performance in regression tasks (unlike classification) and characterize the geometric properties of learned representations in neural multivariate regression.

Method: Analyze models through intrinsic dimension estimation of last-layer features (ID_H) and regression targets (ID_Y) across control tasks and synthetic datasets. Compare collapsed vs non-collapsed models.

Result: Collapsed models show ID_H < ID_Y, causing over-compression and poor generalization. Non-collapsed models typically maintain ID_H > ID_Y. Performance depends on data quantity and noise levels, revealing two regimes: over-compressed and under-compressed.

Conclusion: The geometric relationship between feature and target intrinsic dimensions determines regression performance. Practical strategies can enhance generalization by expanding or reducing feature dimensionality based on the identified regimes.

Abstract: Neural multivariate regression underpins a wide range of domains such as
control, robotics, and finance, yet the geometry of its learned representations
remains poorly characterized. While neural collapse has been shown to benefit
generalization in classification, we find that analogous collapse in regression
consistently degrades performance. To explain this contrast, we analyze models
through the lens of intrinsic dimension. Across control tasks and synthetic
datasets, we estimate the intrinsic dimension of last-layer features (ID_H) and
compare it with that of the regression targets (ID_Y). Collapsed models exhibit
ID_H < ID_Y, leading to over-compression and poor generalization, whereas
non-collapsed models typically maintain ID_H > ID_Y. For the non-collapsed
models, performance with respect to ID_H depends on the data quantity and noise
levels. From these observations, we identify two regimes (over-compressed and
under-compressed) that determine when expanding or reducing feature
dimensionality improves performance. Our results provide new geometric insights
into neural regression and suggest practical strategies for enhancing
generalization.

TL;DR: TsLLM is a time series-augmented LLM that bridges numerical time series analysis with natural language understanding, enabling contextual reasoning and explanations for time series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time series models cannot process text or provide natural language explanations, while LLMs struggle with numerical time series data due to inefficient representations and limited temporal exposure.

Method: Augment an LLM with specialized time series perception using a patch-based encoder-decoder architecture, trained on over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples across diverse analysis tasks.

Result: TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring integration of time series analysis with natural language, though not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new paradigm for time series analysis that democratizes access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural language interaction.

Abstract: Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains
including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing
this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information,
answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language
explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to
their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical
time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure
to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM
with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder
architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus
of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse
analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series
question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language
outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both
its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities.
While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks,
TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of
time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing
approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series
analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding,
democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural
language interaction.

TL;DR: A3-FL framework combines federated learning with attention mechanism to handle non-IID biometric data while preserving privacy through differential privacy and secure protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biometric data is sensitive and centralized training poses privacy risks. Federated learning offers privacy-preserving alternative but struggles with interpretability and heterogeneous non-IID data.

Method: Attention mechanism at central server weights local model updates based on significance. Uses Siamese-CNN for feature extraction from FVC2004 fingerprint data, with differential privacy and secure update protocols.

Result: A3-FL achieved 0.8413 accuracy vs FedAvg (0.8164), Local-only (0.7664), and Centralized (0.7997). Maintained 0.8330 accuracy with differential privacy. Superior convergence speed and robustness.

Conclusion: Proposes scalable, privacy-sensitive biometric system for secure and effective recognition in distributed environments using attention-based federated learning.

Abstract: Because biometric data is sensitive, centralized training poses a privacy
risk, even though biometric recognition is essential for contemporary
applications. Federated learning (FL), which permits decentralized training,
provides a privacy-preserving substitute. Conventional FL, however, has trouble
with interpretability and heterogeneous data (non-IID). In order to handle
non-IID biometric data, this framework adds an attention mechanism at the
central server that weights local model updates according to their
significance. Differential privacy and secure update protocols safeguard data
while preserving accuracy. The A3-FL framework is evaluated in this study using
FVC2004 fingerprint data, with each client's features extracted using a Siamese
Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN). By dynamically modifying client
contributions, the attention mechanism increases the accuracy of the global
model.The accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the A3-FL framework
are superior to those of standard FL (FedAvg) and static baselines, according
to experimental evaluations using fingerprint data (FVC2004). The accuracy of
the attention-based approach was 0.8413, while FedAvg, Local-only, and
Centralized approaches were 0.8164, 0.7664, and 0.7997, respectively. Accuracy
stayed high at 0.8330 even with differential privacy. A scalable and
privacy-sensitive biometric system for secure and effective recognition in
dispersed environments is presented in this work.

### [228] [Eliciting Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Time Series Analysis using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01116)
*Felix Parker,Nimeesha Chan,Chi Zhang,Kimia Ghobadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COUNTS is a framework that trains LLMs to perform Chain-of-Thought reasoning on time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series models lack explicit multi-step reasoning capabilities needed for complex tasks like medical diagnosis and weather forecasting, while LLMs perform poorly on time series despite their CoT reasoning abilities in other domains.

Method: Uses Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create discrete tokens for time series data, followed by two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization with prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps.

Result: RL-driven approach with intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across various time series analysis tasks.

Conclusion: COUNTS opens new possibilities for complex temporal data reasoning by enabling LLMs to perform explicit multi-step reasoning on time series data.

Abstract: Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning
capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and
weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including
counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and
multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot
explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models
(LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through
reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on
mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance
on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical
Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT
reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards.
Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity
discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary.
COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on
time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by
Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using
prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing
final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with
intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across
various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex
temporal data reasoning.

*Sarwan Ali,Haris Mansoor,Murray Patterson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes transforming biological sequence feature representations into hyperboloid space to better capture complex relationships and hierarchical structures, using kernel matrices for similarity measurement and improving classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning approaches struggle with capturing complex relationships and hierarchical structures of sequence data in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces, limiting accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement.

Method: Transform biological sequence feature representations into hyperboloid space, map sequences onto hyperboloid to preserve structural information, compute kernel matrix based on hyperboloid features using inner product of feature vectors to measure sequence similarities.

Result: Experimental evaluation demonstrates the approach effectively captures important sequence correlations and improves classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Representing biological sequences in hyperboloid space enables more effective analysis of sequence relationships and enhances classification performance compared to traditional Euclidean space approaches.

Abstract: Genomic sequence analysis plays a crucial role in various scientific and
medical domains. Traditional machine-learning approaches often struggle to
capture the complex relationships and hierarchical structures of sequence data
when working in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. This limitation hinders
accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement. To address these
challenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature
representation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space. By applying
a transformation, the sequences are mapped onto the hyperboloid, preserving
their inherent structural information. Once the sequences are represented in
the hyperboloid space, a kernel matrix is computed based on the hyperboloid
features. The kernel matrix captures the pairwise similarities between
sequences, enabling more effective analysis of biological sequence
relationships. This approach leverages the inner product of the hyperboloid
feature vectors to measure the similarity between pairs of sequences. The
experimental evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its efficacy in
capturing important sequence correlations and improving classification
accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PDR (Parallel-Distill-Refine) is a new inference method that generates multiple drafts in parallel, distills them into a bounded workspace, and refines the output iteratively, achieving better accuracy than long chain-of-thought reasoning with lower latency and controllable context length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning training incentivizes long chains of thought which increase accuracy but inflate context length, token costs, and latency. The paper explores whether models can use metacognition to find better trade-offs on the Pareto frontier.

Method: Proposes PDR framework: (1) generate diverse drafts in parallel, (2) distill them into a bounded textual workspace, (3) refine conditioned on this workspace. Also introduces Sequential Refinement as a subcase. Trains an 8B model with RL to be consistent with PDR inference.

Result: PDR achieves better accuracy than long CoT with lower latency. On math tasks, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines, with PDR delivering largest gains (+11% on AIME 2024, +9% on AIME 2025). Sequential Refinement also outperforms long CoT.

Conclusion: PDR provides a superior trade-off on the accuracy-latency Pareto frontier compared to long chain-of-thought reasoning, and training models specifically for iterative refinement can further improve performance.

Abstract: Reasoning training incentivizes LLMs to produce long chains of thought (long
CoT), which among other things, allows them to explore solution strategies with
self-checking. This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length,
token/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage
their metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier,
e.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we
view the model as an improvement operator on its own "thoughts" with a
continuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family
Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate
diverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual
workspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output
that seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is
controllable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the
total number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current
models that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency.
Setting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential
Refinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides
performance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises
the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this
end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it
consistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable
answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched
sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME
2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic analysis of multi-turn RL for training LLM agents, breaking down design space into environment, reward, and policy pillars, with empirical findings distilled into a training recipe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for training LLM agents via multi-turn RL are fragmented with no systematic analysis of which design choices matter across tasks.

Method: Empirical study across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and SWE-Gym domains, analyzing environment complexity, reward sparsity, and policy gradient methods (PPO, GRPO, RLOO) with SFT-to-RL ratio optimization.

Result: Found that simple environments provide generalization signal; dense rewards accelerate training but depend on RL algorithm; optimal SFT-to-RL ratio exists; developed co-design training recipe.

Conclusion: Provides systematic formulation and practical training recipe for multi-turn RL of LLM agents, facilitating research and development in agentic RL.

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language
models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress,
existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic
formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address
this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related
pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe
for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test
TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied
reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i)
For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of
sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length,
finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how
well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we
ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards
accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the
choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the
interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO)
policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We
distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the
three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn
agentic RL. Code: https://github.com/pearls-lab/meow-tea-taro

*Zhaolin Gao,Joongwon Kim,Wen Sun,Thorsten Joachims,Sid Wang,Richard Yuanzhe Pang,Liang Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL) is a lightweight RL algorithm that uses a learned value model to select intermediate-difficulty prompts for post-training language models, achieving faster training and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training LLMs via RL is sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, and existing methods using rollout-based filtering are computationally expensive.

Method: PCL identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty using a value model that is concurrently updated with the policy, focusing on prompts with high effective ratios without costly rollouts.

Result: PCL achieves 12.1× and 16.9× faster speed on MATH and DeepScaleR datasets respectively, while reaching comparable or better performance than counterparts.

Conclusion: PCL presents an improved methodology for reasoning-focused RL that delivers better tradeoff between performance and efficiency through adaptive prompt difficulty selection.

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a
learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via
RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first
conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal
training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality
and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate
difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which
identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an
on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on
the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high
effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires
significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts.
Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and
achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying
intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR,
respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts
prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging
prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved
tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused
RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabINR is an auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation framework for tabular data imputation that models tables as neural functions using learnable row and feature embeddings, achieving strong performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world tabular datasets are frequently incomplete due to various reasons, and existing imputation methods either introduce bias or distort data distributions. There's a need for high-quality imputation methods that are robust and provide fast inference.

Method: Uses auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation (INR) framework with learnable row and feature embeddings to model tabular data as neural functions, enabling instance adaptive imputations without model modification.

Result: Consistently strong imputation accuracy across 12 real-world datasets and multiple missingness mechanisms, mostly matching or outperforming classical (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep learning models (GAIN, ReMasker), with clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

Conclusion: TabINR provides an effective INR-based framework for tabular data imputation that handles discrete structure well and delivers robust performance across various dataset sizes and missingness scenarios.

Abstract: Tabular data builds the basis for a wide range of applications, yet
real-world datasets are frequently incomplete due to collection errors, privacy
restrictions, or sensor failures. As missing values degrade the performance or
hinder the applicability of downstream models, and while simple imputing
strategies tend to introduce bias or distort the underlying data distribution,
we require imputers that provide high-quality imputations, are robust across
dataset sizes and yield fast inference. We therefore introduce TabINR, an
auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation (INR) framework that models
tables as neural functions. Building on recent advances in generalizable INRs,
we introduce learnable row and feature embeddings that effectively deal with
the discrete structure of tabular data and can be inferred from partial
observations, enabling instance adaptive imputations without modifying the
trained model. We evaluate our framework across a diverse range of twelve
real-world datasets and multiple missingness mechanisms, demonstrating
consistently strong imputation accuracy, mostly matching or outperforming
classical (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep learning based models (GAIN,
ReMasker), with the clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

TL;DR: A post-processing algorithm using random matrix theory to denoise gradients in DP-SGD fine-tuning of LLMs, improving sample efficiency without compromising privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD adds noise that disrupts the low-rank structure of gradient matrices, increasing entropy and slowing optimization in private fine-tuning of large language models.

Method: Proposed a post-processing algorithm based on random matrix theory to denoise gradients, restore low-rank structure, and improve alignment with the original signal during DP-SGD fine-tuning.

Result: Applied to DP-SGD fine-tuning of RoBERTa on GLUE tasks, the method improved sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches and substantially reduced training time when optimal performance isn't required.

Conclusion: Matrix recovery techniques can enhance the utility of private language model training without compromising privacy guarantees.

Abstract: We address the challenge of sample efficiency in differentially private
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using DP-SGD. While DP-SGD provides
strong privacy guarantees, the added noise significantly increases the entropy
of gradient matrices, disrupting their low-rank structure and slowing
optimization. We propose a post-processing algorithm that leverages random
matrix theory to denoise gradients, restore low-rank structure, and improve
alignment with the original signal. Applied to DP-SGD fine-tuning of RoBERTa on
GLUE tasks, our method improves sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, substantially reducing training time when optimal performance is
not required. This work demonstrates that matrix recovery techniques can
enhance the utility of private language model training without compromising
privacy guarantees.

TL;DR: A novel Hamilton-Jacobi equation-based framework for solving optimal transport problems that provides closed-form bidirectional transport maps without numerical integration, using a single neural network with provable convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient and principled approach to optimal transport that eliminates the need for numerical integration and adversarial training, while supporting various cost functions and class-conditional transport.

Method: Leverages the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and method of characteristics to derive closed-form transport maps, trains a single neural network with a loss function derived from the HJ equation characteristics.

Result: The method achieves accurate, scalable, and efficient optimal transport across diverse datasets, with provable convergence to optimal maps and substantial reduction in computational complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework establishes a principled and versatile tool for optimal transport applications with provable optimality, supporting various cost functions and class-conditional scenarios.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving optimal transport (OT) problems
based on the Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation, whose viscosity solution uniquely
characterizes the OT map. By leveraging the method of characteristics, we
derive closed-form, bidirectional transport maps, thereby eliminating the need
for numerical integration. The proposed method adopts a pure minimization
framework: a single neural network is trained with a loss function derived from
the method of characteristics of the HJ equation. This design guarantees
convergence to the optimal map while eliminating adversarial training stages,
thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the
framework naturally extends to a wide class of cost functions and supports
class-conditional transport. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed method,
establishing it as a principled and versatile tool for OT applications with
provable optimality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALI-CFM is a novel flow matching method that uses adversarial learning to infer trajectories from discrete time observations, outperforming baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell tracking datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning dynamics from sampled observations at discrete time points is challenging, especially when ground-truth trajectories are unavailable. Existing multi-marginal trajectory inference algorithms have limitations that need to be addressed.

Method: ALI-CFM uses a GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neural interpolant curves between source and target points, ensuring marginal distributions at intermediate times match observed distributions. The resulting smooth interpolants are then marginalized via flow matching to learn the underlying vector field.

Result: The method outperforms existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell tracking datasets, while performing comparably on single-cell trajectory prediction. The interpolants are shown to be unique under mild assumptions.

Conclusion: ALI-CFM provides a versatile and scalable approach for trajectory inference from discrete time observations, demonstrating superior performance on complex biological datasets while maintaining competitive performance on standard tasks.

Abstract: Learning the dynamics of a process given sampled observations at several time
points is an important but difficult task in many scientific applications. When
no ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data
taken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus
inferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal
generalisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow
matching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal
trajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a
GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves
between source and target points such that the marginal distributions at
intermediate time points are close to the observed distributions. The resulting
interpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild
assumptions. These interpolants are subsequently marginalised by a flow
matching algorithm, yielding a trained vector field for the underlying
dynamics. We showcase the versatility and scalability of our method by
outperforming the existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell
tracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory
prediction.

### [237] [Prosperity before Collapse: How Far Can Off-Policy RL Reach with Stale Data on LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01161)
*Haizhong Zheng,Jiawei Zhao,Bedi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M2PO enables stable off-policy RL training for large language models by constraining second-moment importance weights, allowing effective use of stale data while matching on-policy performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for LLMs require fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency. Asynchronous RL systems exist but struggle with data staleness, causing performance degradation or collapse.

Method: M2PO (Second-Moment Trust Policy Optimization) constrains the second moment of importance weights to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates from stale data.

Result: M2PO reduces clipped tokens from 1.22% to 0.06% under high staleness, maintains stable optimization, and matches on-policy performance across six models (1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks.

Conclusion: M2PO enables stable off-policy training with data stale by at least 256 model updates, demonstrating that stale data can be as informative as on-policy data when properly exploited.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language
model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands
fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability.
Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from
training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in
rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or
collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse
phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited
properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust
Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights
to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates.
Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high
staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance
tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six
models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable
off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and
matches on-policy performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how statistical properties of pretraining distributions shape in-context learning capabilities in LLMs, developing a theoretical framework and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve in-context learning in LLMs by characterizing how pretraining distribution properties (tail behavior, coverage) affect ICL performance.

Method: Developed theoretical framework unifying task selection and generalization, extended Bayesian consistency results to heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences, and conducted empirical studies on numerical tasks including stochastic differential equations.

Result: Showed that distributional properties govern ICL sample efficiency, task retrieval, and robustness, with empirical validation on challenging numerical tasks.

Conclusion: Controlling key statistical properties of pretraining distributions is essential for building capable and reliable ICL systems in LLMs.

Abstract: The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs)
remains poorly understood despite its consistent effectiveness, enabling models
to adapt to new tasks from only a handful of examples. To clarify and improve
these capabilities, we characterize how the statistical properties of the
pretraining distribution (e.g., tail behavior, coverage) shape ICL on numerical
tasks. We develop a theoretical framework that unifies task selection and
generalization, extending and sharpening earlier results, and show how
distributional properties govern sample efficiency, task retrieval, and
robustness. To this end, we generalize Bayesian posterior consistency and
concentration results to heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences, better
reflecting the structure of LLM pretraining data. We then empirically study how
ICL performance varies with the pretraining distribution on challenging tasks
such as stochastic differential equations and stochastic processes with memory.
Together, these findings suggest that controlling key statistical properties of
the pretraining distribution is essential for building ICL-capable and reliable
LLMs.

*Yiran Shen,Yu Xia,Jonathan Chang,Prithviraj Ammanabrolu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified framework for multi-objective alignment of large language models across verifiable rewards, subjective preferences, and interactive scenarios, using standardized process reward models and multi-action-head DPO to minimize cross-objective trade-offs and enable fine-grained inference-time control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into single objectives, leading to inefficient training and limited user control. The authors seek to simultaneously align models across domains with verifiable rewards, non-verifiable preferences, and complex interactive scenarios.

Method: The framework standardizes process reward model training across verifiable and non-verifiable settings, performs multi-objective alignment using Multi-Action-Head DPO (MAH-DPO) with vectorized rewards (where dimensions correspond to different objectives), and enables fine-grained inference-time user control.

Result: Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn dialogue show improved performance across multiple objectives simultaneously, minimized cross-objective trade-offs, and enabled flexible inference-time user control.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses multi-objective alignment challenges by providing a unified approach that maintains performance across diverse objectives while offering user control during inference.

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently
multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a
single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to
simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with:
verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective
preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI
tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are
often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other,
resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We
propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM)
training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise
models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment}
by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead
$\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the
vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and
(iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user
control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn
dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple
objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and
enabling flexible inference time user control. The code can be found at

TL;DR: Fiaingen introduces novel time series data generation techniques that address data shortages in finance by creating synthetic data that closely mirrors real-world data while maintaining scalability and achieving performance close to real data in downstream ML tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world financial data is limited in quantity, quality, and variety, which hinders the performance of machine learning models for trading and investment. Generative methods can help mitigate this data shortage problem.

Method: A set of novel techniques for time series data generation called Fiaingen, evaluated across three criteria: overlap of real and synthetic data in reduced dimensionality space, performance on downstream ML tasks, and runtime performance.

Result: Fiaingen achieves state-of-the-art performance across all three criteria. Synthetic data closely mirrors original time series data while keeping generation time close to seconds, ensuring scalability. Models trained on synthetic data achieve performance close to those trained with real-world data.

Conclusion: Fiaingen provides an effective solution for financial data generation that addresses data scarcity issues while maintaining data quality and computational efficiency, enabling better machine learning models for financial applications.

Abstract: Data is vital in enabling machine learning models to advance research and
practical applications in finance, where accurate and robust models are
essential for investment and trading decision-making. However, real-world data
is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of
various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning
models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can
mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques
for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their
performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data
on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine
learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that
the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria
listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely
mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close
to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore,
models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world
data.

*Gaoxiang Luo,Aryan Deshwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes COM-BOM, a Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization method for exemplar selection that jointly optimizes for both predictive accuracy and model calibration in in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior exemplar selection methods only optimize for predictive accuracy, neglecting model calibration which is crucial for trustworthy and safe deployment of AI systems.

Method: Formulate exemplar selection as multi-objective optimization problem and solve it using sample-efficient Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization (COM-BOM) to find Pareto front trading off accuracy and calibration.

Result: COM-BOM beats or matches baselines at jointly optimizing accuracy and calibration on MMLU-Pro benchmark tasks, while requiring minimal LLM API calls.

Conclusion: Multi-objective optimization approach to exemplar selection effectively balances accuracy and calibration, providing more trustworthy in-context learning with efficient computation.

Abstract: Selecting an optimal set of exemplars is critical for good performance of
in-context learning. However, prior exemplar search methods narrowly optimize
for predictive accuracy, critically neglecting model calibration--a key
determinant of trustworthiness and safe deployment. In this paper, we formulate
exemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, explicitly
targeting both the maximization of predictive accuracy and the minimization of
expected calibration error. We solve this problem with a sample-efficient
Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto
front that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration.
We evaluate COM-BOM on multiple tasks from unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark and
find that COM-BOM beats or matches the baselines at jointly optimizing the two
objectives, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls.

*Zhangchen Xu,Adriana Meza Soria,Shawn Tan,Anurag Roy,Ashish Sunil Agrawal,Radha Poovendran,Rameswar Panda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Toucan is the largest publicly available tool-agentic dataset with 1.5 million trajectories synthesized from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs), designed to address the lack of high-quality training data for LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in open-source LLM agents is constrained by the lack of high-quality permissively licensed tool-agentic training data, with existing datasets being limited in diversity, realism, and complexity.

Method: The pipeline generates diverse tool-use queries using five models, applies quality filtering, and generates agentic trajectories with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks, with rigorous validation and extension mechanisms for multi-turn conversations.

Result: Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and advance the Pareto frontier on MCP-Universe Bench.

Conclusion: Toucan successfully addresses the data gap for tool-agentic training and enables open-source LLM agents to achieve competitive performance against closed-source alternatives.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems
for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community
is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic
training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and
complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To
address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available
tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized
from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,
Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and
challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline
first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,
applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories
with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and
model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three
extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn
conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source
counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on
MCP-Universe Bench.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BroRL scales reinforcement learning by increasing rollouts per example instead of training steps, overcoming performance plateaus in ProRL and achieving continuous improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ProRL shows diminishing returns after thousands of training steps, with performance plateaus. The authors investigate an alternative scaling approach through broader exploration.

Method: Increase number of rollouts per example to hundreds for exhaustive exploration. Use mass balance equation analysis to characterize probability mass changes during reinforcement learning.

Result: BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training steps, shows continuous improvement, and achieves state-of-the-art results for 1.5B model across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Broadening exploration through increased rollouts provides an effective complementary scaling paradigm to training steps, overcoming saturation and enabling continuous performance gains.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language
models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the
number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of
steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to
additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for
scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to
exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains
beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of
training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis
allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct
and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a
one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to
correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to
gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.
Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of
unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To
validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed
conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to
ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct
tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training
steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving
state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

*Yanbo Xu,Yu Wu,Sungjae Park,Zhizhuo Zhou,Shubham Tulsiani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to control sampling diversity in diffusion and flow matching models by rescaling score functions, enabling sampling from sharper or broader distributions without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide users with control over sampling diversity in generative models, allowing adjustment of distribution sharpness for different tasks without model modifications.

Method: Rescaling learned score functions of noisy data distributions to control local sampling temperature, compatible with existing models and samplers.

Result: Validated on 2D data and applied to image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and protein design, showing task-specific performance improvements.

Conclusion: The approach enables flexible control over sampling diversity across various tasks, with optimal performance depending on task requirements (sharper for depth prediction, flatter for image generation).

Abstract: We present a mechanism to steer the sampling diversity of denoising diffusion
and flow matching models, allowing users to sample from a sharper or broader
distribution than the training distribution. We build on the observation that
these models leverage (learned) score functions of noisy data distributions for
sampling and show that rescaling these allows one to effectively control a
`local' sampling temperature. Notably, this approach does not require any
finetuning or alterations to training strategy, and can be applied to any
off-the-shelf model and is compatible with both deterministic and stochastic
samplers. We first validate our framework on toy 2D data, and then demonstrate
its application for diffusion models trained across five disparate tasks --
image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and
protein design. We find that across these tasks, our approach allows sampling
from sharper (or flatter) distributions, yielding performance gains e.g., depth
prediction models benefit from sampling more likely depth estimates, whereas
image generation models perform better when sampling a slightly flatter
distribution. Project page: https://temporalscorerescaling.github.io

TL;DR: DPSL is a novel router regularization technique that shapes routing probability distributions using a Dirichlet prior to improve expert specialization in upcycled MoE models, outperforming existing methods across vision-language benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Upcycling pre-trained dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts often suffers from poor expert specialization due to naive weight replication and weakly differentiated routing, hindering performance despite conventional regularization.

Method: Introduces Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a router regularization technique that matches expert assignments to a target Dirichlet prior, enabling fine-grained control over expert balance and specialization without manual intervention.

Result: DPSL consistently outperforms existing upcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard vision-language benchmarks with various LLM backbones (Qwen2, Phi3, Llama3.2), addressing poor specialization issues.

Conclusion: DPSL fosters more adaptive, higher-performing MoE models by improving expert specialization and is a general tool applicable to any module outputting categorical probability distributions, extending beyond MoE training.

Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs)
efficiently increases model capacity but often suffers from poor expert
specialization due to naive weight replication. Our analysis reveals that
upcycled MoEs, even with conventional regularization, exhibit low-confidence,
weakly differentiated routing, hindering performance. We introduce
Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a novel router regularization technique
that directly shapes routing probability distributions by matching expert
assignments to a target Dirichlet prior. DPSL offers fine-grained control over
expert balance and specialization, and enables encoding of inductive biases
such as encouraging experts to focus on specific modalities or tasks, without
requiring manual intervention; notably, DPSL is a general tool applicable to
any module that outputs categorical probability distributions, extending its
utility beyond MoE training. Experiments on upcycled MoE vision-language models
(with Qwen2, Phi3, Llama3.2 LLM backbones) show DPSL consistently outperforms
upcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard
vision-language benchmarks, addressing the critical issue of poor
specialization and fostering more adaptive, higher-performing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG interpretation using multimodal large language models faces challenges due to the complex nature of brain activity where EEG signals simultaneously encode cognitive processes and intrinsic neural states, creating modality mismatches that hinder cross-modal representation learning.

Method: The authors propose mapping EEG signals and their corresponding modalities into a unified semantic space, and introduce WaveMind-Instruct-338k - the first cross-task EEG dataset for instruction tuning to enable conversational capabilities.

Result: The resulting model demonstrates robust classification accuracy while supporting flexible, open-ended conversations across four downstream tasks.

Conclusion: This approach offers valuable insights for both neuroscience research and the development of general-purpose EEG models by enabling effective cross-modal representation learning and conversational interpretation of EEG signals.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) interpretation using multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) offers a novel approach for analyzing brain signals. However,
the complex nature of brain activity introduces critical challenges: EEG
signals simultaneously encode both cognitive processes and intrinsic neural
states, creating a mismatch in EEG paired-data modality that hinders effective
cross-modal representation learning. Through a pivot investigation, we uncover
complementary relationships between these modalities. Leveraging this insight,
we propose mapping EEG signals and their corresponding modalities into a
unified semantic space to achieve generalized interpretation. To fully enable
conversational capabilities, we further introduce WaveMind-Instruct-338k, the
first cross-task EEG dataset for instruction tuning. The resulting model
demonstrates robust classification accuracy while supporting flexible,
open-ended conversations across four downstream tasks, thereby offering
valuable insights for both neuroscience research and the development of
general-purpose EEG models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a standardized point-data format for radio propagation measurements to enable integration of data from disparate sources, demonstrated through joint analysis of sub-THz measurements from two independent campaigns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a standardized format for reporting and archiving radio propagation measurement data hinders effective utilization and global standardization efforts, despite existing pooling initiatives by organizations like NIST, NGA, and 3GPP.

Method: Proposes a standardized point-data format for radio propagation measurements, along with an environmental map and measurement summary metadata table, to create structured representation of key parameters that enables integration of data from different sources.

Result: Successfully demonstrated the efficacy of the format by merging data from two independent sub-THz urban microcell campaigns (142 GHz at NYU and 145 GHz at USC), enabling joint path loss analysis and refined estimation of path loss exponent, RMS delay spread, and angular spread.

Conclusion: Adopting this simple, unified format will accelerate channel model development, build multi-institutional datasets, and provide reliable training data for AI/ML applications from multiple sources in a common format.

Abstract: The necessity of new spectrum for 6G has intensified global interest in radio
propagation measurements across emerging frequency bands, use cases, and
antenna types. These measurements are vital for understanding radio channel
properties in diverse environments, and involve time-consuming and expensive
campaigns. A major challenge for the effective utilization of propagation
measurement data has been the lack of a standardized format for reporting and
archiving results. Although organizations such as NIST, NGA, and 3GPP have made
commendable efforts for data pooling, a unified machine-readable data format
for consolidating measurements across different institutions and frequencies
remains a missing piece in advancing global standardization efforts. This paper
introduces a standardized point-data format for radio propagation measurements
and demonstrates how institutions may merge disparate campaigns into a common
format. This data format, alongside an environmental map and a measurement
summary metadata table, enables integration of data from disparate sources by
using a structured representation of key parameters. Here, we show the efficacy
of the point-data format standard using data gathered from two independent
sub-THz urban microcell (UMi) campaigns: 142 GHz measurements at New York
University (NYU) and 145 GHz measurements at the University of Southern
California (USC). A joint path loss analysis using the close-in path loss model
(1 m ref. distance) yields a refined estimate of the path loss exponent (PLE)
employing the proposed standard to pool measurements. Other statistics such as
RMS delay spread and angular spread are also determined using a joint
point-data table. Adopting this simple, unified format will accelerate channel
model development, build multi-institutional datasets, and feed AI/ML
applications with reliable training data in a common format from many sources.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A beam learning framework that bypasses explicit self-interference channel estimation for full-duplex systems, using beam codebooks and deep learning to synthesize transmit/receive beams with 75-97% fewer measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing beamforming-based full-duplex solutions require explicit self-interference channel estimation, which has prohibitively high pilot overhead in millimeter-wave and massive MIMO systems, especially in fast-fading conditions.

Method: Proposes a beam learning framework that uses beam codebooks to efficiently obtain implicit channel knowledge, processed by a deep learning network to synthesize transmit and receive beams for full-duplex operation.

Result: Simulation results show the technique allows full-duplex base stations to craft serving beams with low self-interference and high SNR, requiring 75-97% fewer measurements than explicit channel estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed beam learning framework provides a practical solution for full-duplex systems by eliminating the need for explicit self-interference channel estimation, significantly reducing measurement overhead while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Existing beamforming-based full-duplex solutions for multi-antenna wireless
systems often rely on explicit estimation of the self-interference channel. The
pilot overhead of such estimation, however, can be prohibitively high in
millimeter-wave and massive MIMO systems, thus limiting the practicality of
existing solutions, especially in fast-fading conditions. In this work, we
present a novel beam learning framework that bypasses explicit
self-interference channel estimation by designing beam codebooks to efficiently
obtain implicit channel knowledge that can then be processed by a deep learning
network to synthesize transmit and receive beams for full-duplex operation.
Simulation results using ray-tracing illustrate that our proposed technique can
allow a full-duplex base station to craft serving beams that couple low
self-interference while delivering high SNR, with 75-97% fewer measurements
than would be required for explicit estimation of the self-interference
channel.

TL;DR: This paper uses electrodermal activity during an Emotional Stroop task to detect depression and suicidal ideation by modeling skin conductance responses as a point process modulated by task covariates, achieving better classification than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable earlier detection and objective assessment of mental health issues by identifying biomarkers through physiological responses during emotional tasks.

Method: Model skin conductance responses as a point process with conditional intensity modulated by task covariates (stimulus valence, reaction time, response accuracy), then use subject-specific parameters for machine learning classification.

Result: The model parameters capture meaningful physiological differences related to depression and yield superior classification performance compared to conventional feature extraction approaches.

Conclusion: Point process modeling of electrodermal activity during emotional tasks provides effective biomarkers for depression detection, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Accurate identification of mental health biomarkers can enable earlier
detection and objective assessment of compromised mental well-being. In this
study, we analyze electrodermal activity recorded during an Emotional Stroop
task to capture sympathetic arousal dynamics associated with depression and
suicidal ideation. We model the timing of skin conductance responses as a point
process whose conditional intensity is modulated by task-based covariates,
including stimulus valence, reaction time, and response accuracy. The resulting
subject-specific parameter vector serves as input to a machine learning
classifier for distinguishing individuals with and without depression. Our
results show that the model parameters encode meaningful physiological
differences associated with depressive symptomatology and yield superior
classification performance compared to conventional feature extraction methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in prenatal care in remote areas by developing comfortable, accessible fetal ECG monitoring that works through clothing without direct skin contact.

Method: Developed a fetal ECG monitoring system using novel non-contact electrodes integrated into a maternity belt, with data acquisition and transmission modules, and compared performance against traditional Ag/AgCl electrodes.

Result: The non-contact electrodes showed comparable performance to traditional wet electrodes, and a pilot study with 10 pregnant women (25-32 weeks gestation) demonstrated system performance, usability and safety.

Conclusion: The non-contact electrode system provides a viable alternative for comfortable fetal ECG monitoring, particularly beneficial for remote and resource-poor areas.

Abstract: Regular physiological monitoring of maternal and fetal parameters is
indispensable for ensuring safe outcomes during pregnancy and parturition.
Fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) assessment is crucial to detect fetal distress
and developmental anomalies. Given challenges of prenatal care due to the lack
of medical professionals and the limit of accessibility, especially in remote
and resource-poor areas, we develop a fECG monitoring system using novel
non-contact electrodes (NCE) to record the fetal/maternal ECG (f/mECG) signals
through clothes, thereby improving the comfort during measurement. The system
is designed to be incorporated inside a maternity belt with data acquisition,
data transmission module as well as novel NCEs. Thorough characterizations were
carried out to evaluate the novel NCE against traditional wet electrodes (i.e.,
Ag/AgCl electrodes), showing comparable performance. A successful {preliminary
pilot feasibility study} conducted with pregnant women (n = 10) between 25 and
32 weeks of gestation demonstrates the system's performance, usability and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images suffer from various noise types due to equipment and environment. Existing TV-based methods cause staircase artifacts or lack rotation invariance, making them unsuitable for accurately recovering round structures and oblique edges.

Method: Introduces GeoSSTV that measures variations across all directions in a Euclidean manner. Formulates HS image denoising as constrained convex optimization problem and develops efficient algorithm using preconditioned primal-dual splitting method.

Result: Experimental results on HS images with mixed noise demonstrate superiority over existing approaches, effectively removing noise while preserving round structures and oblique edges.

Conclusion: GeoSSTV provides an effective solution for hyperspectral image denoising and destriping by overcoming limitations of traditional TV methods through geometrically consistent formulation and efficient optimization algorithm.

Abstract: This article proposes a novel regularization method, named Geometric
Spatio-Spectral Total Variation (GeoSSTV), for hyperspectral (HS) image
denoising and destriping. HS images are inevitably affected by various types of
noise due to the measurement equipment and environment. Total Variation
(TV)-based regularization methods that model the spatio-spectral piecewise
smoothness inherent in HS images are promising approaches for HS image
denoising and destriping. However, existing TV-based methods are based on
classical anisotropic and isotropic TVs, which cause staircase artifacts and
lack rotation invariance, respectively, making it difficult to accurately
recover round structures and oblique edges. To address this issue, GeoSSTV
introduces a geometrically consistent formulation of TV that measures
variations across all directions in a Euclidean manner. Through this
formulation, GeoSSTV removes noise while preserving round structures and
oblique edges. Furthermore, we formulate the HS image denoising problem as a
constrained convex optimization problem involving GeoSSTV and develop an
efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method.
Experimental results on HS images contaminated with mixed noise demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over existing approaches.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a radiation pattern reconfigurable fluid antenna system (RPR-FAS) for UAV communications to enhance interference resilience and spectral efficiency through adjustable radiation patterns and advanced AoA estimation algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of UAVs has led to advanced counter-UAV techniques, but the resistance of legal UAVs to illegal interference remains under-addressed, creating a need for interference-resilient communication schemes.

Method: The proposed method integrates reconfigurable pixel antenna technology with adjustable radiation patterns, uses a low-storage-overhead orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm for AoA estimation, and employs alternating optimization for optimal uplink radiation patterns and combiners with exhaustive search for downlink patterns.

Result: Comprehensive simulations show the proposed schemes outperform traditional methods in angular sensing precision and spectral efficiency, achieving 1-2 order-of-magnitude reduction in storage requirements.

Conclusion: RPR-FAS provides an effective solution for interference-resilient UAV communications by enhancing angular resolution with limited antennas, improving both spectral efficiency and interference resilience through advanced radiation pattern reconfiguration and AoA estimation techniques.

Abstract: The widespread use of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) has propelled the
development of advanced techniques on countering unauthorized UAV flights.
However, the resistance of legal UAVs to illegal interference remains
under-addressed. This paper proposes radiation pattern reconfigurable fluid
antenna systems (RPR-FAS)-empowered interference-resilient UAV communication
scheme. This scheme integrates the reconfigurable pixel antenna technology,
which provides each antenna with an adjustable radiation pattern. Therefore,
RPR-FAS can enhance the angular resolution of a UAV with a limited number of
antennas, thereby improving spectral efficiency (SE) and interference
resilience. Specifically, we first design dedicated radiation pattern adapted
from 3GPP-TR-38.901, where the beam direction and half power beamwidth are
tailored for UAV communications. Furthermore, we propose a low-storage-overhead
orthogonal matching pursuit multiple measurement vectors algorithm, which
accurately estimates the angle-of-arrival (AoA) of the communication link, even
in the single antenna case. Particularly, by utilizing the Fourier transform to
the radiation pattern gain matrix, we design a dimension-reduction technique to
achieve 1--2 order-of-magnitude reduction in storage requirements. Meanwhile,
we propose a maximum likelihood interference AoA estimation method based on the
law of large numbers, so that the SE can be further improved. Finally,
alternating optimization is employed to obtain the optimal uplink radiation
pattern and combiner, while an exhaustive search is applied to determine the
optimal downlink pattern, complemented by the water-filling algorithm for
beamforming. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes
outperform traditional methods in terms of angular sensing precision and
spectral efficiency.

Method: Used ray-tracing simulation to generate synthetic datasets, then trained and validated multiple ML models including RFR and KNN on both synthetic and measurement data from KAUST campus.

Result: RFR and KNN provided the best prediction accuracy among ML models, and ML-based models significantly outperformed traditional models (COST-231 Hata, Longley-Rice, Close-in).

Conclusion: ML approach with ray-tracing offers a promising, cost-effective, and flexible solution for radio wave propagation prediction in various scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate path loss (PL) prediction is crucial for successful network
planning, antenna design, and performance optimization in wireless
communication systems. Several conventional approaches for PL prediction have
been adopted, but they have been demonstrated to lack flexibility and accuracy.
In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) models
in predicting PL, particularly for the sub-6 GHz band in a suburban campus of
King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). For training
purposes, we generate synthetic datasets using the ray-tracing simulation
technique. The feasibility and accuracy of the ML-based PL models are verified
and validated using both synthetic and measurement datasets. The random forest
regression (RFR) and the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms provide the best
PL prediction accuracy compared to other ML models. In addition, we compare the
performance of the developed ML-based PL models with the traditional
propagation models, including COST-231 Hata, Longley-Rice, and Close-in models.
The results show the superiority of the ML-based PL models compared to
conventional models. Therefore, the ML approach using the ray-tracing technique
can provide a promising and cost-effective solution for predicting and modeling

TL;DR: Proposes a robust beamforming framework that incorporates RFI location uncertainty into satellite communication systems to improve interference mitigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RFI poses challenges in LEO satellite uplinks due to spectrum congestion and uncertainty in terrestrial interferer locations, requiring robust interference mitigation.

Method: Analytical characterization of RFI location uncertainty effects, followed by a robust null-shaping framework using stochastic optimization that incorporates RFI location PDF into beamforming design.

Result: Extensive simulations show significantly improved mitigation performance compared to conventional deterministic designs under realistic satellite dynamics and RFI scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed stochastic optimization approach effectively enhances interference suppression in satellite communications by accounting for RFI location uncertainty.

Abstract: Radio frequency interference (RFI) poses a growing challenge to satellite
communications, particularly in uplink channels of Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
systems, due to increasing spectrum congestion and uncertainty in the location
of terrestrial interferers. This paper addresses the impact of RFI source
position uncertainty on beamforming-based interference mitigation. First, we
analytically characterize how geographic uncertainty in RFI location translates
into angular deviation as observed from the satellite. Building on this, we
propose a robust null-shaping framework to increase resilience in the
communication links by incorporating the probability density function (PDF) of
the RFI location uncertainty into the beamforming design via stochastic
optimization. This allows adaptive shaping of the antenna array's nulling
pattern to enhance interference suppression under uncertainty. Extensive Monte
Carlo simulations, incorporating realistic satellite orbital dynamics and
various RFI scenarios, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves
significantly improved mitigation performance compared to conventional
deterministic designs.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A simulation method for RIS-assisted channels using ray tracing with terrain and building data, showing power variations and performance improvements proportional to RIS size squared.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an accurate simulation method for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted channels that accounts for real-world environmental factors like terrain and buildings.

Method: Used three channel black boxes representing direct, transmit-to-RIS, and RIS-reflected paths with complex coefficients obtained from ray tracing that includes terrain, building shapes, and electrical characteristics of surfaces.

Result: Received power shows multipath fading patterns; RIS-assisted channels match theoretical models in best locations with performance scaling by RIS size squared; deployment near transmitter or receiver performs best with U-shaped performance drop between them.

Conclusion: The simulation method effectively models RIS-assisted channels and validates theoretical predictions about performance scaling and optimal deployment locations.

Abstract: A method of simulating a single-input single-output reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) assisted channel is presented using three channel
black boxes to represent the direct signal path, the transmit path to the RIS
and the reflected path from the RIS. The complex coefficients for each channel
box is obtained by ray tracing in a scenario with geographic terrain
information that also contains approximate building shapes. The electrical
characteristics of the ground and building walls were also accounted for in the
ray tracing function. Simulations were conducted with reflected rays only and
reflected rays together with diffracted rays. The received power exhibits
variations typical of multipath fading environments. In the best locations, the
RIS-assisted channel simulation result agrees well with theoretical models, the
performance increasing by the RIS size squared as the number of RIS elements is
increased. In the simplified theoretical model where the transmitter and
receiver are inline and the RIS orthogonal but much closer than the distance
between the former elements, the simulation results also corroborate best
deployment close the transmitter or the receiver with a U-shaped drop between
them.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Next-generation wireless networks need intelligent traffic prediction for autonomous resource management and dynamic service demands, with O-RAN providing a foundation for embedding ML intelligence.

Method: NAS-based framework that dynamically orchestrates LSTM architectures, leveraging O-RAN's disaggregated architecture with architecture optimization via non-RT RIC rApps and real-time inference via near-RT RIC xApps.

Result: Lightweight models achieve R² ≈ 0.91-0.93 for regular traffic, while complex models reach near-perfect accuracy (R² = 0.989-0.996) during critical scenarios. NAS orchestration reduces computational complexity by 70-75% compared to static high-performance models.

Conclusion: The approach enables scalable deployment in real-world edge environments by maintaining high prediction accuracy while significantly reducing computational requirements through adaptive model selection.

Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks require intelligent traffic prediction to
enable autonomous resource management and handle diverse, dynamic service
demands. The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) framework provides a promising
foundation for embedding machine learning intelligence through its
disaggregated architecture and programmable interfaces. This work applies a
Neural Architecture Search (NAS)-based framework that dynamically selects and
orchestrates efficient Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures for traffic
prediction in O-RAN environments. Our approach leverages the O-RAN paradigm by
separating architecture optimisation (via non-RT RIC rApps) from real-time
inference (via near-RT RIC xApps), enabling adaptive model deployment based on
traffic conditions and resource constraints. Experimental evaluation across six
LSTM architectures demonstrates that lightweight models achieve $R^2 \approx
0.91$--$0.93$ with high efficiency for regular traffic, while complex models
reach near-perfect accuracy ($R^2 = 0.989$--$0.996$) during critical scenarios.
Our NAS-based orchestration achieves a 70-75\% reduction in computational
complexity compared to static high-performance models, while maintaining high
prediction accuracy when required, thereby enabling scalable deployment in
real-world edge environments.

### [257] [Graph Neural Networks in Large Scale Wireless Communication Networks: Scalability Across Random Geometric Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00896)
*Romina Garcia Camargo,Zhiyang Wang,Alejandro Ribeiro*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper provides theoretical guarantees for the transferability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in wireless networks modeled as Random Geometric Graphs, addressing the gap between empirical success and existing theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wireless networks naturally form graphs, making GNNs suitable for learning-based solutions. While empirical studies show GNNs transfer well across different network sizes, existing theoretical work assumes dense graphs with node degrees scaling with network size, which doesn't match the sparse nature of wireless networks.

Method: The authors develop a formal theoretical foundation for GNN transferability on Random Geometric Graphs (RGGs), which are sparse graphs that better model wireless networks. They validate their theoretical results through numerical experiments on power allocation tasks.

Result: The paper establishes theoretical guarantees showing that GNN-based wireless policies can effectively transfer across different graph sizes in sparse wireless network settings, which was previously only observed empirically but lacked formal theoretical support.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between empirical observations and theoretical understanding of GNN transferability in wireless networks, providing a solid foundation for using GNNs in practical wireless resource management applications.

Abstract: The growing complexity of wireless systems has accelerated the move from
traditional methods to learning-based solutions. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
are especially well-suited here, since wireless networks can be naturally
represented as graphs. A key property of GNNs is transferability: models
trained on one graph often generalize to much larger graphs with little
performance loss. While empirical studies have shown that GNN-based wireless
policies transfer effectively, existing theoretical guarantees do not capture
this phenomenon. Most works focus on dense graphs where node degrees scale with
network size, an assumption that fails in wireless systems. In this work, we
provide a formal theoretical foundation for transferability on Random Geometric
Graphs (RGGs), a sparse and widely used model of wireless networks. We further
validate our results through numerical experiments on power allocation, a
fundamental resource management task.

### [258] [A Robust Proactive Communication Strategy for Distributed Active Noise Control Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00934)
*Junwei Ji,Dongyuan Shi,Zhengding Luo,Boxiang Wang,Ziyi Yang,Haowen Li,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A robust communication framework for distributed multichannel active noise control systems that uses adaptive-fixed-filter switching and mixed-gradient combination to maintain stability while achieving centralized algorithm-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed multichannel ANC systems face communication overhead that can undermine stability and degrade performance, requiring a robust solution to maintain effectiveness under communication constraints.

Method: Each node runs single-channel FxLMS algorithm and monitors noise reduction performance. When degradation occurs, it switches to fixed filter and initiates communication by exchanging accumulated gradient differences. Uses mixed-gradient combination to update control filters before reverting to adaptive mode.

Result: Simulations show the method achieves noise reduction performance comparable to centralized algorithms while maintaining stability under communication constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed proactive communication strategy and adaptive-fixed switching mechanism ensure system robustness and practical applicability in real-world distributed ANC scenarios.

Abstract: Distributed multichannel active noise control (DMCANC) systems assign the
high computational load of conventional centralized algorithms across multiple
processing nodes, leveraging inter-node communication to collaboratively
suppress unwanted noise. However, communication overhead can undermine
algorithmic stability and degrade overall performance. To address this
challenge, we propose a robust communication framework that integrates
adaptive-fixed-filter switching and the mixed-gradient combination strategy. In
this approach, each node independently executes a single-channel filtered
reference least mean square (FxLMS) algorithm while monitoring real-time noise
reduction levels. When the current noise reduction performance degrades
compared to the previous state, the node halts its adaptive algorithm, switches
to a fixed filter, and simultaneously initiates a communication request. The
exchanged information comprises the difference between the current control
filter and the filter at the time of the last communication, equivalent to the
accumulated gradient sum during non-communication intervals. Upon receiving
neighboring cumulative gradients, the node employs a mixed-gradient combination
method to update its control filter, subsequently reverting to the adaptive
mode. This proactive communication strategy and adaptive-fixed switching
mechanism ensure system robustness by mitigating instability risks caused by
communication issues. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
noise reduction performance comparable to centralized algorithms while
maintaining stability under communication constraints, highlighting its
practical applicability in real-world distributed ANC scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models suffer from computational inefficiencies due to overthinking, and existing methods struggle to balance reasoning quality with inference cost reduction.

Method: ARS uses a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism with progressive suppression thresholds to dynamically suppress redundant reasoning steps without requiring additional training.

Result: ARS achieves up to 53% token reduction, 46.1% latency reduction, and 57.9% energy reduction while maintaining or improving accuracy across mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ARS provides an effective training-free solution for improving computational efficiency in large reasoning models while preserving reasoning quality.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant
computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient
reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with
inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression

TL;DR: NeurIPS should actively catalyze scientific consensus on AI policy to address the current void in consensus formation mechanisms, drawing lessons from IPCC's approach to climate policy consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a complete void in mechanisms for scientific consensus formation on AI policy, which is crucial for designing wise AI policy. Policymakers need rigorous evidence and scientific consensus but current systems lack proper consensus-building processes.

Method: Propose that NeurIPS should take leadership in catalyzing scientific consensus on AI policy by running initial pilots, distilling lessons from IPCC's successful approach to building scientific consensus on climate policy.

Result: Identifies NeurIPS as the best positioned organization for this role due to its strengths and lack of compelling alternatives. Dispels counterarguments that AI researchers disagree too much or that policy engagement isn't NeurIPS's business.

Conclusion: NeurIPS should champion scientific consensus formation to create higher quality AI policy, as it already leads AI on many fronts and this role aligns with its mission and capabilities.

Abstract: Designing wise AI policy is a grand challenge for society. To design such
policy, policymakers should place a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific
consensus. While several mechanisms exist for evidence generation, and nascent
mechanisms tackle evidence synthesis, we identify a complete void on consensus
formation. In this position paper, we argue NeurIPS should actively catalyze
scientific consensus on AI policy. Beyond identifying the current deficit in
consensus formation mechanisms, we argue that NeurIPS is the best option due
its strengths and the paucity of compelling alternatives. To make progress, we
recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's
leadership to build scientific consensus on climate policy. We dispel
predictable counters that AI researchers disagree too much to achieve consensus
and that policy engagement is not the business of NeurIPS. NeurIPS leads AI on
many fronts, and it should champion scientific consensus to create higher
quality AI policy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper audits vision language models (VLMs) for bail decision prediction, finds they perform poorly and wrongly deny bail with high confidence, then proposes interventions using RAG and fine-tuning to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of VLMs, legal judgment systems can now use criminal images alongside text, but this could lead to harmful consequences if deployed without proper safeguards.

Method: The study first audits standalone VLMs' performance on bail prediction, then designs interventions including legal precedents via RAG pipeline and innovative fine-tuning schemes.

Result: Standalone VLMs perform poorly across intersectional groups and wrongly deny bail to deserving individuals with high confidence. The proposed interventions substantially improve bail prediction performance.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for designing smarter interventions on VLMs before real-world deployment in legal judgment prediction systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for legal judgment
prediction tasks based on case reports and crime history. However, with a surge
in the availability of large vision language models (VLMs), legal judgment
prediction systems can now be made to leverage the images of the criminals in
addition to the textual case reports/crime history. Applications built in this
way could lead to inadvertent consequences and be used with malicious intent.
In this work, we run an audit to investigate the efficiency of standalone VLMs
in the bail decision prediction task. We observe that the performance is poor
across multiple intersectional groups and models \textit{wrongly deny bail to
deserving individuals with very high confidence}. We design different
intervention algorithms by first including legal precedents through a RAG
pipeline and then fine-tuning the VLMs using innovative schemes. We demonstrate
that these interventions substantially improve the performance of bail
prediction. Our work paves the way for the design of smarter interventions on
VLMs in the future, before they can be deployed for real-world legal judgment
prediction.

TL;DR: Embodied AI with large visual language models enables autonomous drones to perform adaptive recovery and decision-making in response to sudden events, overcoming limitations of hand-coded rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional hand-coded recovery rules for drones are incomplete and cannot anticipate the vast range of real-world contingencies, requiring more adaptive approaches.

Method: Using embodied AI powered by large visual language models to provide commonsense reasoning, assess context, and generate appropriate actions in real time within a simulated urban benchmark in Unreal Engine.

Result: Drones successfully interpret surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings, demonstrating adaptive recovery capabilities previously infeasible with manual design.

Conclusion: Embodied AI enables a new class of adaptive recovery and decision-making pipelines that advance resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,
provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate
actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban
benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their
surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show
that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and
decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand,

Result: Demonstrated effective classification performance on CLEVR-Hans datasets, showing competitive results against baseline models.

Conclusion: SAA-CBR successfully integrates neural and symbolic components for image classification, providing a promising neuro-symbolic approach with competitive performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thinkquel is a fine-tuned model that transforms natural language to robust, portable database queries using synthetic data generation and span-aware reinforcement learning to bridge token-level training with sequence-level execution rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language to SQL conversion faces challenges with schema linking, SQL dialect specificity, and misalignment between token-level training objectives and sequence-level execution validation signals, making it difficult to create reliable production-ready queries.

Method: Thinkquel integrates TS-SQL synthetic data pipeline using dbt as portable intermediate representation and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO) reinforcement learning that bridges token-level training with sequence-level execution rewards during LLM fine-tuning.

Result: On TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) achieved 93.2% execution success and 61.8% exact-result match, improving base model by 67.2% and 44.4% respectively. In Spider experiments, TS-GRPO increased training stability and accelerated convergence compared to GRPO and GSPO.

Conclusion: Thinkquel demonstrates that combining synthetic data generation with span-aware reinforcement learning effectively addresses the alignment problem between token-level training and sequence-level execution validation, enabling robust and portable natural language to SQL conversion.

Abstract: Transforming natural-language requests into reliable, production-ready data
transformations remains challenging: correctness depends on precise schema
linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision
available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided
only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large,
execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with
these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability.
We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and
execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a
novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable
intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective,
and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap
between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when
finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches
93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT
curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match).
In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds
convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Decoupled fine-tuning method improves local LLMs' tool calling by separating tool selection and argument generation into dedicated LoRA adapters, achieving 46% accuracy improvement on Qwen-2.5-7B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local LLMs underperform frontier models in tool calling scenarios, struggling with tool selection from large sets and accurate argument generation for complex parameters, while privacy and cost concerns demand on-device solutions.

Method: Proposes decoupled fine-tuning using LoRA adapters for tool selection and argument generation with separate loss masking, and DualTune inference framework that dynamically loads adapters and implements hierarchical orchestration to limit tool selection scope.

Result: Qwen-2.5-7B model with decoupled fine-tuning improves tool calling accuracy by 46%, outperforms similar-sized models in all cases, and larger models (2x size) in most cases on MCP-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: The decoupled approach effectively addresses local LLMs' limitations in tool calling, enabling efficient on-device agent orchestration with significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has
revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving,
cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However,
local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool
calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and
accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a
methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:
tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a
novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated
LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using
separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present
DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using
decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of
local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation
step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the
corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune
implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required
for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that
the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool
calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local
reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases,
and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAGIC-MASK is a mathematically grounded framework that extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, integrating PPO, adaptive exploration, and inter-agent collaboration to provide interpretable explanations while improving learning efficiency and policy robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding decision-making in Deep RL agents is crucial for safety-critical and multi-agent environments. Prior methods like StateMask are limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to multi-agent settings.

Method: Integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration for sharing masked state information and peer experience. Uses saliency-guided masking and reward-based insights sharing, with mathematical formalism based on trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and KL divergence regularization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy robustness on both single-agent and multi-agent benchmarks including multi-agent highway driving and Google Research Football.

Conclusion: MAGIC-MASK successfully generalizes explainability from single-agent to multi-agent systems, providing localized, interpretable explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling while enabling faster critical state discovery and more robust learning.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of Deep Reinforcement Learning
agents remains a key challenge for deploying these systems in safety-critical
and multi-agent environments. While prior explainability methods like
StateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain
limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to
multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent
Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that
extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy
exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state
information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to
perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,
reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation
fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of
our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to
multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on
trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler
divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable
explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision
processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent
benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google
Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy
robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

### [271] [ICL Optimized Fragility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00300)
*Serena Gomez Wannaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICL guides improve task-specific performance but create trade-offs in cross-domain reasoning, showing 'optimized fragility' where simple tasks improve but complex reasoning degrades.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains and understand their impact on cross-domain cognitive abilities.

Method: Tested six GPT-OSS:20b variants (baseline + five ICL configurations) on 840 tests spanning general knowledge, logic riddles, and mathematical olympiad problems, using statistical analysis (ANOVA).

Result: ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge but dropped to 10-43% on riddles (vs 43% baseline). No significant differences on olympiad problem (p=0.2173), showing mathematical reasoning unaffected.

Conclusion: ICL guides create systematic trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

Abstract: ICL guides are known to improve task-specific performance, but their impact
on cross-domain cognitive abilities remains unexplored. This study examines how
ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains using six
variants of the GPT-OSS:20b model: one baseline model and five ICL
configurations (simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, and symbolic
language). The models were subjected to 840 tests spanning general knowledge
questions, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad problem. Statistical
analysis (ANOVA) revealed significant behavioral modifications (p less than
0.001) across ICL variants, demonstrating a phenomenon termed "optimized
fragility." ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge tasks
while showing degraded performance on complex reasoning problems, with accuracy
dropping to 10-43% on riddles compared to 43% for the baseline model. Notably,
no significant differences emerged on the olympiad problem (p=0.2173),
suggesting that complex mathematical reasoning remains unaffected by ICL
optimization. These findings indicate that ICL guides create systematic
trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important
implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

*Thierry Blankenstein,Jialin Yu,Zixuan Li,Vassilis Plachouras,Sunando Sengupta,Philip Torr,Yarin Gal,Alasdair Paren,Adel Bibi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents show systematic bias in selecting tools from marketplaces, preferring certain providers or earlier-listed options, which creates fairness issues in tool-augmented LLM deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness concerns in LLM-based tool selection, where systematic bias can degrade user experience and distort competition by privileging some providers over others.

Method: Created a benchmark with diverse tool categories containing functionally equivalent tools, tested seven models, conducted controlled experiments on tool features/metadata/pre-training exposure, and proposed a lightweight mitigation approach.

Result: Found significant unfairness in tool selection with models fixating on single providers or preferring earlier-listed tools; semantic alignment between queries and metadata is strongest predictor; perturbing descriptions shifts selections; pre-training exposure amplifies bias.

Conclusion: Tool-selection bias is a key obstacle for fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs, and the proposed mitigation (filtering candidates then uniform sampling) reduces bias while preserving task coverage.

Abstract: Agents backed by large language models (LLMs) often rely on external tools
drawn from marketplaces where multiple providers offer functionally equivalent
options. This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is
systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition
by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse
tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to
evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and
show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or
disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate
the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool
features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure.
We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the
strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts
selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint
amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters
the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing
bias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection
bias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.

*Kaiwen Yu,Mengying Sun,Zhijin Qin,Xiaodong Xu,Ping Yang,Yue Xiao,Gang Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication framework with three techniques: semantic adaptation transmission, semantic lightweight transmission, and semantic self-evolution control to enable efficient multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With communication targets shifting from humans to AI agents, semantic communication offers promise but faces constraints from dynamic environments and limited resources in practical deployment.

Method: Developed three enabling techniques: 1) Semantic adaptation transmission using fine-tuning with real/generative samples, 2) Semantic lightweight transmission using pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling, 3) Semantic self-evolution control using distributed hierarchical decision-making.

Result: Simulation results show faster convergence and stronger robustness. The distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly outperforms conventional decision-making schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates strong potential for AI agent communication networks by enabling efficient multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments through semantic-driven approaches.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are
shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new
paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration.
Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw
data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains
constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these
issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication
framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation
transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently
adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission
incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce
model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,
semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical
decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust
multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that
the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,
while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly
outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential
for AI agent communication networks.

### [274] [When Hallucination Costs Millions: Benchmarking AI Agents in High-Stakes Adversarial Financial Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00332)
*Zeshi Dai,Zimo Peng,Zerui Cheng,Ryan Yihe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAIA benchmark reveals AI models' critical weakness in adversarial environments - they fail to distinguish truth from manipulation, make poor tool choices, and achieve only 28-67% accuracy vs 80% human baseline in high-stakes crypto market scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI benchmarks don't test resilience against active deception in high-stakes environments where errors are irreversible, creating a dangerous blind spot in AI evaluation for real-world deployment.

Method: Created CAIA benchmark using crypto markets as testbed, evaluating 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring truth/manipulation distinction, navigation of fragmented information, and irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.

Result: Models achieved only 28% accuracy without tools, 67.4% with tools vs 80% human baseline. Critical failure: models preferentially choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized misinformation despite correct answers being accessible.

Conclusion: Current AI models remain fundamentally unprepared for adversarial environments despite impressive reasoning scores. Adversarial robustness is a necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy, with implications extending to cybersecurity, content moderation, and other domains with active adversaries.

Abstract: We present CAIA, a benchmark exposing a critical blind spot in AI evaluation:
the inability of state-of-the-art models to operate in adversarial, high-stakes
environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible.
While existing benchmarks measure task completion in controlled settings,
real-world deployment demands resilience against active deception. Using crypto
markets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we
evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish
truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make
irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.
  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier
models achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle.
Tool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human
baseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically,
we uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially
choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized
misinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when
correct answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting
foundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k
metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.
  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries,
e.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination
controls and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a
necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark reveals that
current models, despite impressive reasoning scores, remain fundamentally
unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition.

TL;DR: Critical review of Hierarchical Reasoning Models for transformers, examining design choices and presenting variants that achieve better performance on Sudoku-Extreme and Maze-Hard tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers excel at sequential tasks but struggle with logical reasoning, possibly due to unexplored creative uses like latent space and recurrent reasoning. Hierarchical Reasoning Models show promise but need deeper investigation.

Method: Performed critical review of Hierarchical Reasoning Models, examined key design choices, and developed variants of the model.

Result: Achieved significantly better performance on Sudoku-Extreme and Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported results.

Conclusion: The work raises surprising observations and intriguing directions for further research in transformer-based logical reasoning models.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language
processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential,
autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical
reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models,
but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as
latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction
is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a
novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers,
achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite
the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls
for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this
class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants
that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and
Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising
observations and intriguing directions for further research.

TL;DR: This paper presents a comparative benchmarking study of classical machine learning models for fault classification and localization in power system protection using EMT data, evaluating performance under real-time constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources, particularly renewables, poses challenges for power system protection. Conventional protection schemes with fixed thresholds cannot reliably handle dynamic grid conditions, and systematic ML benchmarks are limited.

Method: Used voltage and current waveforms segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, evaluated classical ML models for fault classification and localization under realistic real-time constraints.

Result: Best-performing FC model achieved F1 score of 0.992±0.001, top FL model reached R2 of 0.806±0.008 with mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

Conclusion: Machine learning offers a promising alternative to conventional protection schemes, with demonstrated high performance in fault classification and localization under real-time constraints.

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system
protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being
among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed
thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the
increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning
(ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across
models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a
comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power
system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms
segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under
realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy,
robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model
achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2
of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

TL;DR: TRACE framework enables automatic evolution of benchmark tasks to higher complexity levels through agent exploration, addressing the problem of rapid ceiling-hitting in existing agent benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent benchmarks are quickly becoming obsolete as new agents rapidly achieve maximum scores, creating a need for more challenging and sustainable evaluation systems.

Method: Three-stage framework: (1) evolutionary proposal mining through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking, (2) problem formation and free exploration with trajectory recording, and (3) multi-level validation to ensure validatable and reproducible trajectories.

Result: Experiments on GAIA benchmark show TRACE consistently enhances task complexity while improving reliability through validatable execution trajectories.

Conclusion: TRACE represents a paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic, self-evolving evaluation systems that provide sustainable challenges for agent development.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have
empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing
agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly
developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent
abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based
Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)
framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and
encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher
difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework
proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task
evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2)
problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into
feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while
recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which
ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible
trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE
framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability
of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a
paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic,
self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging
runway for agent development.

TL;DR: Automated evaluation of AI responses to patient health questions can closely match expert ratings when using clinician-authored reference answers, enabling scalable assessment of healthcare AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gold standard of human expert review for evaluating AI health responses is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated metrics show promise but have variable alignment with human judgments.

Method: Conducted large systematic study across 100 patient cases with responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total). Assessed responses on three dimensions: question answering, clinical note evidence usage, and general medical knowledge. Used clinician-authored reference answers to anchor automated metrics.

Result: Automated rankings closely matched expert ratings when using clinician-authored reference answers as anchors for evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI systems and support patient-clinician communication, addressing the scalability limitations of human expert review.

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

*Kenjiro Ide,Taiga Someya,Kohei Kawaguchi,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EDMS is a semantically enriched state representation for soccer analysis that augments raw player data with tactical variables and uses action masking to create interpretable agent models with improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based soccer analysis is intuitive but limited, while modern ML models lack interpretability and explicit agent representations. The goal is to build player-level agent models that are both tactically interpretable and robust across data sources.

Method: Proposed Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS) that enrich raw positions/velocities with relational variables (space scoring, pass, score) and use action masking to give on-ball/off-ball agents distinct decision sets.

Result: EDMS with action masking consistently reduced action-prediction loss and temporal-difference error compared to baselines. It highlighted high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns and demonstrated compatibility with multiple datasets.

Conclusion: EDMS successfully creates interpretable agent models that map learned values to tactical concepts, aligns with game rules, and enables cross-provider evaluation while improving prediction performance.

Abstract: Invasion team sports such as soccer produce a high-dimensional, strongly
coupled state space as many players continuously interact on a shared field,
challenging quantitative tactical analysis. Traditional rule-based analyses are
intuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform
pattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address
is how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and
policies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data
sources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a
semantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and
velocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),
combined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents
distinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value
functions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,
marking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate
features, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,
EDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and
temporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case
studies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights
high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and
defensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source
library and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open
datasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible experiments.

TL;DR: Contrary to conventional wisdom, generative outcome reward models (GenORM) outperform process reward models (PRMs) across 14 diverse domains, challenging the assumption that fine-grained stepwise supervision is always better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the reliability of large language models during test-time scaling by comparing different reward model variants across diverse domains, challenging the prevailing assumption that process reward models (PRMs) always outperform outcome reward models (ORMs).

Method: Unified evaluation of four reward model variants (discriminative ORM and PRM, generative ORM and PRM) across 14 diverse domains, with theoretical analysis of error compounding in stepwise scoring and empirical validation.

Result: GenORM was the most robust performer, yielding significant and consistent gains across all tested domains, while DisORM performed on par with DisPRM and GenPRM was not competitive. Stepwise scoring suffers from label noise and difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories.

Conclusion: Fine-grained stepwise supervision is not always better; generative outcome verification is more effective for multi-domain deployment due to error compounding in stepwise aggregation and challenges with long reasoning trajectories.

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is
often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that
distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes
that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning
step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final
answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent
domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants,
discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM
(\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not
competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding
significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this
to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM
auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories,
including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis
shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows,
and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge
the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and
support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We
publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at
\href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}}

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VIRTUE is a visual-interactive embedding model that extends segmentation and vision-language models to enable region-specific representation learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on universal and visual-interactive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embedding models lack visual-interactive capabilities to specify regions of interest, limiting their ability to handle localized user intent and learn entity-level information within images.

Method: VIRTUE integrates segmentation models to process visual prompts (point, bounding box, mask) that pinpoint specific image regions, enabling precise handling of complex scenarios in representation learning.

Result: VIRTUE achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal MMEB tasks (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR tasks (15.2%-20.3%).

Conclusion: VIRTUE successfully extends visual-interactive capabilities to embedding models, enabling localized grounding of user intent and entity-level learning while maintaining strong performance on conventional embedding tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

TL;DR: This paper develops 15 data quality dimensions for RAG systems through interviews with IT practitioners, revealing the need for new dimensions, front-loaded quality management, and dynamic approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data quality frameworks are inadequate for RAG systems' dynamic, multi-stage nature, creating a gap in quality management for AI-based systems.

Method: Conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with IT practitioners and performed qualitative content analysis to inductively derive data quality dimensions.

Result: Identified 15 distinct data quality dimensions across four RAG processing stages: data extraction, transformation, prompt & search, and generation.

Conclusion: Traditional DQ frameworks need expansion for RAG contexts, quality management should be front-loaded in early stages, and dynamic approaches are needed to address issue propagation through the pipeline.

Abstract: Organizations increasingly adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
enhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However,
current data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static
datasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG
systems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based
systems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading
IT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively
derive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG
systems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.
Our findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ
frameworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are
concentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality
management strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the
RAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality
management.

### [283] [Toward Safer Diffusion Language Models: Discovery and Mitigation of Priming Vulnerability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00565)
*Shojiro Yamabe,Jun Sakuma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that exploit their iterative denoising process by injecting affirmative tokens for harmful queries, which can bypass safety guardrails. The paper proposes a novel safety alignment method that trains DLMs to generate safe responses from contaminated intermediate states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit DLMs' parallel token generation through iterative denoising, which enables bidirectional conditioning but creates critical vulnerabilities.

Method: Proposed a novel safety alignment method tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from contaminated intermediate states containing affirmative tokens for harmful queries.

Result: The proposed method significantly mitigates the vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance and improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: DLMs have critical vulnerabilities in their iterative denoising process that require DLM-specific safety research, and the proposed alignment method effectively addresses these risks while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through
iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional
conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit
this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that
DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising
process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows
that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate
step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in
aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can
readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed
on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method
tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from
contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our
experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the
vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method
improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work
underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

### [284] [ACON: Optimizing Context Compression for Long-horizon LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00615)
*Minki Kang,Wei-Ning Chen,Dongge Han,Huseyin A. Inan,Lukas Wutschitz,Yanzhi Chen,Robert Sim,Saravan Rajmohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACON is a framework that compresses agent context (observations and histories) to reduce memory usage while maintaining task performance, using LLM-based compression guideline optimization and distillation to smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of growing context length in LLM agents for long-horizon tasks, which increases costs and reduces efficiency, as prior compression methods focused mainly on single-step tasks.

Method: Uses compression guideline optimization in natural language space: LLMs analyze failure cases from compressed contexts and update guidelines accordingly, then distills optimized compressors into smaller models.

Result: Reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while preserving task performance, maintains over 95% accuracy when distilled, and improves smaller LMs' performance by up to 46% as long-horizon agents.

Conclusion: ACON effectively addresses context length challenges in agentic tasks through optimized compression and distillation, enabling efficient long-horizon reasoning with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

### [285] [HARPA: A Testability-Driven, Literature-Grounded Framework for Research Ideation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00620)
*Rosni Vasu,Peter Jansen,Pao Siangliulue,Cristina Sarasua,Abraham Bernstein,Peter Clark,Bhavana Dalvi Mishra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARPA is an AI system for automated scientific discovery that generates testable, literature-grounded hypotheses by identifying research trends, exploring design spaces, and pinpointing research gaps. It outperforms baselines in feasibility and groundedness, and learns from experimental outcomes to refine hypothesis generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in automated scientific discovery where existing tools struggle to generate testable, literature-grounded hypotheses and lack adaptability to prior experimental outcomes.

Method: HARPA incorporates human researcher workflow: literature mining to identify trends, exploring hypothesis design spaces, converging on precise hypotheses by finding research gaps and justifying design choices. It also learns a reward model from experimental outcomes.

Result: HARPA-generated proposals perform comparably to baseline AI-researcher in most dimensions but achieve significant gains in feasibility (+0.78) and groundedness (+0.85). With ASD agent CodeScientist, it produced more successful executions (20 vs 11) and fewer failures (16 vs 21). The reward model achieved ~28% absolute gain over untrained baseline.

Conclusion: HARPA represents a step forward in AI-driven scientific discovery by generating more feasible and grounded hypotheses that can be successfully executed, while learning from experimental outcomes to improve hypothesis generation.

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

### [286] [Is Model Editing Built on Sand? Revealing Its Illusory Success and Fragile Foundation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00625)
*Wei Liu,Haomei Xu,Bingqing Liu,Zhiying Deng,Haozhao Wang,Jun Wang,Ruixuan Li,Yee Whye Teh,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current model editing methods appear successful but actually exploit shortcuts rather than real semantic understanding, failing under simple negation tests and challenging the foundation of model editing research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs encode outdated/incorrect knowledge that needs updating, but current model editing approaches may be fundamentally flawed by relying on shortcuts rather than genuine knowledge integration.

Method: Developed a systematic evaluation suite with negative examples and negation queries to test the robustness of state-of-the-art model editing methods.

Result: State-of-the-art editing approaches collapse under simple negation queries, revealing they likely exploit shortcuts rather than achieve full semantic understanding.

Conclusion: Model editing research needs urgent reconsideration of its foundations as current methods appear to be based on illusory success through shortcut exploitation rather than robust knowledge integration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect
knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for
alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has
emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of
parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other
knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the
apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current
literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of
steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would
encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics.
This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing
literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with
robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured
by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover
it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we
find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation
queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on
shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of
the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully
pursued.

### [287] [Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM) for Accelerated and Lightweight Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00627)
*Bingzhang Wang,Kehua Chen,Yinhai Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CDDM is a lightweight trajectory prediction method that uses collaborative progressive distillation to reduce model size and sampling steps while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show strong performance in trajectory prediction but have large model size and slow sampling, hindering real-world deployment in autonomous vehicles.

Method: Collaborative progressive distillation transfers knowledge from teacher to student model, reducing sampling steps and model size with dual-signal regularized distillation loss.

Result: Achieves 96.2% ADE and 95.5% FDE performance with only 231K parameters, 4-2 sampling steps (161x compression, 31x acceleration, 9ms latency) on ETH-UCY and nuScenes benchmarks.

Conclusion: CDDM enables resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for autonomous vehicles by bridging high-performing generative models with practical deployment constraints.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning
and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently
demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but
their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.
This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel
method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon
Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student
model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size
across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is
further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and
ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust
performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the
nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the
baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while
requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x
compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further
show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent
behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing
generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables
resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS. Code is available

*Alessio Devoto,Maximilian Jeblick,Simon Jégou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Expected Attention is a training-free KV cache compression method that estimates KV pair importance by predicting future query attention, overcoming limitations of traditional attention-score-based pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory consumption of KV cache is a major bottleneck for LLM inference, and existing attention-score-based pruning methods face practical limitations due to unavailability of future token attention scores and modern implementations like Flash Attention not materializing full attention matrices.

Method: Leverages distributional properties of LLM activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV pair, enabling principled ranking and pruning without performance degradation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prefilling and decoding phases, achieving effective compression with minimal impact on residual stream.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical solution for KV cache compression and the authors release KVPress library with over 20 techniques for researchers to implement and benchmark KV cache compression methods.

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

### [290] [Relevance-Zone Reduction in Game Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00689)
*Chi-Huang Lin,Ting Han Wei,Chun-Jui Wang,Hung Guei,Chung-Chin Shih,Yun-Jui Tsai,I-Chen Wu,Ti-Rong Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an iterative method to reduce Relevance-Zone (RZ) sizes in game solving, which improves strategy reuse and pruning efficiency by gradually restricting search regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Game solving faces exponential growth of game trees, making many games unsolved. While RZ technique reduces search space, different solutions create varying RZ sizes, and smaller RZs are preferred for better reuse and efficiency.

Method: An iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves positions while gradually restricting regions, with three constraint generation strategies and an RZ Pattern Table to leverage past solutions.

Result: In experiments on 7x7 Killall-Go, the method reduces average RZ size to 85.95% of the original, and the reduced RZs can be stored as reusable knowledge.

Conclusion: The proposed iterative RZ reduction method effectively reduces RZ sizes, enhancing reuse potential and efficiency for future solving tasks, especially for larger boards or different openings.

Abstract: Game solving aims to find the optimal strategies for all players and
determine the theoretical outcome of a game. However, due to the exponential
growth of game trees, many games remain unsolved, even though methods like
AlphaZero have demonstrated super-human level in game playing. The
Relevance-Zone (RZ) is a local strategy reuse technique that restricts the
search to only the regions relevant to the outcome, significantly reducing the
search space. However, RZs are not unique. Different solutions may result in
RZs of varying sizes. Smaller RZs are generally more favorable, as they
increase the chance of reuse and improve pruning efficiency. To this end, we
propose an iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves the same
position while gradually restricting the region involved, guiding the solver
toward smaller RZs. We design three constraint generation strategies and
integrate an RZ Pattern Table to fully leverage past solutions. In experiments
on 7x7 Killall-Go, our method reduces the average RZ size to 85.95% of the
original. Furthermore, the reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable
knowledge for future solving tasks, especially for larger board sizes or
different openings.

*Yunhao Wang,Ziting Li,Shuai Chen,Tao Liu,Chao Song,Junjie Jiang,Jian Zhu,Peng Gao,Bin Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACPO introduces adaptive curriculum policy optimization with dynamic sample reuse and advantage-aware adaptive clipping to improve VLM alignment for complex reasoning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing policy optimization algorithms like PPO have limitations including static training schedules and rigid clipping mechanisms that hinder effective alignment of vision-language models for complex reasoning tasks.

Method: ACPO uses a dual-component adaptive strategy: 1) dynamic curriculum that transitions from on-policy exploration to off-policy exploitation via progressive sample reuse, and 2) advantage-aware adaptive clipping with dynamic, sample-wise bounds based on normalized token advantages.

Result: ACPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal reasoning benchmarks (MathVista, LogicVista, MMMU-Pro), outperforming DAPO and PAPO baselines with accelerated convergence and superior training stability.

Conclusion: The adaptive curriculum and advantage-aware clipping mechanisms in ACPO provide more effective and stable policy optimization for aligning vision-language models on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Aligning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning via
reinforcement learning is often hampered by the limitations of existing policy
optimization algorithms, such as static training schedules and the rigid,
uniform clipping mechanism in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this work,
we introduce Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization (ACPO), a novel framework
that addresses these challenges through a dual-component adaptive learning
strategy. First, ACPO employs a dynamic curriculum that orchestrates a
principled transition from a stable, near on-policy exploration phase to an
efficient, off-policy exploitation phase by progressively increasing sample
reuse. Second, we propose an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) mechanism
that replaces the fixed clipping hyperparameter with dynamic, sample-wise
bounds modulated by the normalized advantage of each token. This allows for
more granular and robust policy updates, enabling larger gradients for
high-potential samples while safeguarding against destructive ones. We conduct
extensive experiments on a suite of challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks, including MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro. Results demonstrate
that ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines such as DAPO and PAPO,
achieving state-of-the-art performance, accelerated convergence, and superior
training stability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AttentionDep is a domain-aware attention model for depression severity detection from social media posts, combining contextual analysis with mental health domain knowledge for explainable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media platforms provide insights into individuals' mental states, creating opportunities for automated depression detection, but existing methods lack explainability and domain knowledge integration.

Method: Hierarchical encoding of posts using unigrams and bigrams with attention mechanisms, incorporating domain knowledge from mental health knowledge graphs via cross-attention, and using ordinal regression for severity prediction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets while providing interpretable insights into predictions.

Conclusion: Advances trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health assessment from social media through explainable depression severity estimation.

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window
into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores
the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for
depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware
attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by
fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using
unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically
relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph
is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual
features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression
framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while
providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the
development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health
assessment from social media.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover trained with novel data augmentation methods (EvolAST, EvolDomain, EvolDifficulty), achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple formal math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs for formal theorem proving lack generalizability and are fragile to minor transformations of problem statements, limiting their practical utility.

Method: Three data augmentation methods: EvolAST (syntactic symmetry via AST transformations), EvolDomain (semantic symmetry via domain translation), and EvolDifficulty (generating theorems with varying difficulty levels). These are used to train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover.

Result: EvolProver achieves SOTA on FormalMATH-Lite (53.8% pass@32), MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32), surpassing comparable-sized models including reasoning-based ones.

Conclusion: The proposed data augmentation pipeline effectively enhances model robustness and generalizability in formal theorem proving, establishing new benchmarks for non-reasoning models across multiple domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for formal theorem proving have shown
significant promise, yet they often lack generalizability and are fragile to
even minor transformations of problem statements. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel data augmentation pipeline designed to enhance model
robustness from two perspectives: symmetry and difficulty. From the symmetry
perspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate
semantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs
to address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical
domains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses
carefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new
theorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to
train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver
establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8%
pass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including
reasoning-based models. It also sets new SOTA records for non-reasoning models
on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and
Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32). Ablation studies further confirm our
data augmentation pipeline's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes DIA (DDIM Inversion Attack), a defensive method that disrupts DDIM inversion trajectories to prevent malicious image editing and deepfake creation using diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDIM inversion enables real image editing but has been misused for creating deepfakes and unethical content. Existing defenses like AdvDM and Photoguard are ineffective due to misalignment with denoising trajectories.

Method: DIA attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path to disrupt the diffusion process, specifically targeting the inversion operation used for image editing.

Result: DIA effectively disrupts malicious image editing, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing techniques.

Conclusion: The framework provides practical defense against malicious AI use and can benefit both industry and research communities in combating unethical content creation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing
state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated
sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent
codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real
image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized
during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool
has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake
contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive,
as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive
algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the
diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives
and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive
performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that
attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective
disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing
methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical
defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the
research community. Our code is available here:

Method: Created 10 manually curated datasets for nanomaterials and small molecules, conducted benchmarking of existing agentic systems, and introduced a single-agent approach with controlled document preprocessing.

Result: Empirical findings show persistent challenges in processing domain-specific terminology, complex tabular/schematic representations, and context-dependent ambiguities.

Conclusion: ChemX serves as a critical resource for advancing automated information extraction in chemistry and challenges the generalization capabilities of existing methods.

Abstract: The emergence of agent-based systems represents a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, with growing applications in automated data
extraction. However, chemical information extraction remains a formidable
challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of chemical data. Current
agent-based approaches, both general-purpose and domain-specific, exhibit
limited performance in this domain. To address this gap, we present ChemX, a
comprehensive collection of 10 manually curated and domain-expert-validated
datasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules. These datasets are
designed to rigorously evaluate and enhance automated extraction methodologies
in chemistry. To demonstrate their utility, we conduct an extensive
benchmarking study comparing existing state-of-the-art agentic systems such as
ChatGPT Agent and chemical-specific data extraction agents. Additionally, we
introduce our own single-agent approach that enables precise control over
document preprocessing prior to extraction. We further evaluate the performance
of modern baselines, such as GPT-5 and GPT-5 Thinking, to compare their
capabilities with agentic approaches. Our empirical findings reveal persistent
challenges in chemical information extraction, particularly in processing
domain-specific terminology, complex tabular and schematic representations, and
context-dependent ambiguities. The ChemX benchmark serves as a critical
resource for advancing automated information extraction in chemistry,
challenging the generalization capabilities of existing methods, and providing

*Nicholas Leisegang,Giovanni Casini,Thomas Meyer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper compares weighted knowledge bases (cost-based semantics) with c-representations for handling inconsistent knowledge bases, showing semantic equivalence under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare two different approaches for dealing with inconsistent knowledge bases in ontology-mediated data querying: weighted knowledge bases with cost-based semantics and c-representations for defeasible reasoning.

Method: Semantic comparison by analyzing how both approaches generate orderings on interpretations through numerical penalties for rule violations, and examining conditions for equivalence.

Result: Shows that under certain conditions, both approaches can generate the same ordering on interpretations, establishing semantic equivalence up to relative cost. Also compares entailment relations between the formalisms.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate potential connections between cost-based semantics and c-representations, which could benefit future work in both areas of knowledge representation.

Abstract: Weighted-knowledge bases and cost-based semantics represent a recent
formalism introduced by Bienvenu et al. for Ontology Mediated Data Querying in
the case where a given knowledge base is inconsistent. This is done by adding a
weight to each statement in the knowledge base (KB), and then giving each DL
interpretation a cost based on how often it breaks rules in the KB. In this
paper we compare this approach with c-representations, a form of non-monotonic
reasoning originally introduced by Kern-Isberner. c-Representations describe a
means to interpret defeasible concept inclusions in the first-order case. This
is done by assigning a numerical ranking to each interpretations via penalties
for each violated conditional. We compare these two approaches on a semantic
level. In particular, we show that under certain conditions a weighted
knowledge base and a set of defeasible conditionals can generate the same
ordering on interpretations, and therefore an equivalence of semantic
structures up to relative cost. Moreover, we compare entailment described in
both cases, where certain notions are equivalently expressible in both
formalisms. Our results have the potential to benefit further work on both
cost-based semantics and c-representations

*Andrés Corrada-Emmanuel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a logic-based approach for unsupervised evaluation of classifiers by analyzing agreements and disagreements between multiple experts, using linear programming to compute consistent group evaluations without ground truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the asymmetry in utility between expert agreements and disagreements, and enable evaluation of classifiers when ground truth labels are unavailable, particularly for detecting when LLM judges violate grading thresholds.

Method: Formalizes a logic of unsupervised evaluation using linear programming in integer space, with logical constraints and axioms as inequalities and equalities, applied to statistical summaries of aligned decisions.

Result: Developed no-knowledge alarms that can detect when LLM judges violate specified minimum grading thresholds using only logical consistency of their agreements and disagreements.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates practical utility for unsupervised evaluation by leveraging logical consistency of expert decisions without requiring ground truth data.

Abstract: If two experts disagree on a test, we may conclude both cannot be 100 per
cent correct. But if they completely agree, no possible evaluation can be
excluded. This asymmetry in the utility of agreements versus disagreements is
explored here by formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation for
classifiers. Its core problem is computing the set of group evaluations that
are logically consistent with how we observe them agreeing and disagreeing in
their decisions. Statistical summaries of their aligned decisions are inputs
into a Linear Programming problem in the integer space of possible correct or
incorrect responses given true labels. Obvious logical constraints, such as,
the number of correct responses cannot exceed the number of observed responses,
are inequalities. But in addition, there are axioms, universally applicable
linear equalities that apply to all finite tests. The practical and immediate
utility of this approach to unsupervised evaluation using only logical
consistency is demonstrated by building no-knowledge alarms that can detect
when one or more LLMs-as-Judges are violating a minimum grading threshold

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the class imbalance problem in detecting pump and dump manipulation in cryptocurrency markets, which hinders accurate detection due to scarcity of such events.

Method: Applied Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and evaluated advanced ensemble learning models to distinguish manipulative trading behavior from normal market activity.

Result: SMOTE greatly enhanced all models' ability to detect P&D events by increasing recall and improving precision-recall balance. XGBoost and LightGBM achieved high recall rates (94.87% and 93.59% respectively) with strong F1-scores and fast computational performance.

Abstract: This study aims to detect pump and dump (P&D) manipulation in cryptocurrency
markets, where the scarcity of such events causes severe class imbalance and
hinders accurate detection. To address this issue, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, and advanced ensemble learning
models were evaluated to distinguish manipulative trading behavior from normal
market activity. The experimental results show that applying SMOTE greatly
enhanced the ability of all models to detect P&D events by increasing recall
and improving the overall balance between precision and recall. In particular,
XGBoost and LightGBM achieved high recall rates (94.87% and 93.59%,
respectively) with strong F1-scores and demonstrated fast computational
performance, making them suitable for near real time surveillance. These
findings indicate that integrating data balancing techniques with ensemble
methods significantly improves the early detection of manipulative activities,
contributing to a fairer, more transparent, and more stable cryptocurrency
market.

### [300] [Learning Compact Representations of LLM Abilities via Item Response Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00844)
*Jianhao Chen,Chenxu Wang,Gengrui Zhang,Peng Ye,Lei Bai,Wei Hu,Yuzhong Qu,Shuyue Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Item Response Theory (IRT) to learn compact representations of LLM abilities, enabling efficient model routing and performance prediction through a Mixture-of-Experts network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth in large language models creates challenges in efficiently managing and utilizing these resources, particularly for tasks like model selection and performance estimation on new benchmarks.

Method: The approach models the probability of correct answers using IRT-inspired factors: model's multi-skill ability vector, query's discrimination vector, and query's difficulty scalar. A Mixture-of-Experts network jointly learns these parameters by coupling model- and query-level embeddings.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance in model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. The learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about model capabilities and query characteristics.

Conclusion: The IRT-inspired framework effectively captures LLM abilities in compact representations, enabling efficient model management and performance prediction while providing interpretable insights into model capabilities.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models
(LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact
representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as
model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this
problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer
a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,
we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's
multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that
separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To
learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network
that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both
model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates
that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about
model capabilities and query characteristics.

Result: Evaluation with real-world and synthetic data shows AIDE effectively identifies data transformations and models that uncover interesting data patterns.

Conclusion: AIDE provides a robust, extensible foundation for automated knowledge discovery with potential for future integration of additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge.

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly focused on leveraging data from their
processes to gain insights and drive decision-making. However, converting this
data into actionable knowledge remains a difficult and time-consuming task.
There is often a gap between the volume of data collected and the ability to
process and understand it, which automated knowledge discovery aims to fill.
Automated knowledge discovery involves complex open problems, including
effectively navigating data, building models to extract implicit relationships,
and considering subjective goals and knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method for Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE), that serves as
a robust foundation for tackling these challenges through the use of Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We evaluate AIDE using both real-world and synthetic
data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying data transformations and
models that uncover interesting data patterns. Among its strengths, AIDE's
MCTS-based framework offers significant extensibility, allowing for future
integration of additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge.
This makes AIDE a valuable step towards developing a comprehensive solution for
automated knowledge discovery.

*Ran Liu,Yuan Fang,Xiaoli Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FusionAdapter is a novel method for few-shot relationship learning in Multimodal Knowledge Graphs that uses adapter modules and fusion strategies to better leverage complementary multimodal information while preserving modality-specific characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMKG methods align modalities into a shared space, which overlooks distinct modality contributions and limits performance in low-resource settings, particularly for few-shot relationship learning.

Method: Proposes FusionAdapter with (1) adapter modules for efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen relations, and (2) fusion strategies that integrate multimodal entity representations while preserving modality-specific characteristics.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, showing improved generalization to novel relations with minimal supervision.

Conclusion: FusionAdapter effectively addresses the limitations of existing MMKG methods by better adapting and fusing diverse multimodal information, achieving enhanced performance in few-shot relationship learning scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) incorporate various modalities, including
text and images, to enhance entity and relation representations. Notably,
different modalities for the same entity often present complementary and
diverse information. However, existing MMKG methods primarily align modalities
into a shared space, which tends to overlook the distinct contributions of
specific modalities, limiting their performance particularly in low-resource
settings. To address this challenge, we propose FusionAdapter for the learning
of few-shot relationships (FSRL) in MMKG. FusionAdapter introduces (1) an
adapter module that enables efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen
relations and (2) a fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity
representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics. By
effectively adapting and fusing information from diverse modalities,
FusionAdapter improves generalization to novel relations with minimal
supervision. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate
that FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

### [303] [On Discovering Algorithms for Adversarial Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00922)
*Shashank Reddy Chirra,Jayden Teoh,Praveen Paruchuri,Pradeep Varakantham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DAIL is a meta-learned Adversarial Imitation Learning algorithm that discovers data-driven reward assignment functions through LLM-guided evolution, outperforming human-designed baselines and improving training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIL methods focus on density ratio estimation but overlook reward assignment's impact on training dynamics and policy performance. Human-designed reward functions rely heavily on ingenuity, motivating the search for data-driven alternatives.

Method: Leverages an LLM-guided evolutionary framework to explore and discover reward assignment functions based directly on imitation policy performance, creating the first meta-learned AIL algorithm.

Result: DAIL generalizes across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms, outperforming state-of-the-art human-designed baselines and demonstrating more stable training.

Conclusion: The discovered reward assignment functions provide novel insights into AIL stability, showing that data-driven approaches can surpass human-designed solutions in imitation learning.

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings
with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These
approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR)
estimation $\frac{\rho_E}{\rho_{\pi}}$, where a discriminator estimates the
relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert;
and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward
signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on
improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing
training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA
functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives,
relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a
different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions,
i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To
this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently
explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial
Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably,
DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines.
Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel
insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL. Code is

*Yoonju Sim,Hyeonah Kim,Changhyun Kwon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes test-time search with stochasticity to enhance neural separation for CVRP, introducing stochastic edge selection and GraphCHiP algorithm to identify both RCIs and FCIs, reducing dual gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based separation methods for CVRP produce fewer cuts than expected due to insufficient sensitivity to generate diverse subsets, limiting their effectiveness in cutting plane methods.

Method: Introduces stochastic edge selection in graph coarsening and proposes GraphCHiP algorithm that leverages coarsening history to identify both rounded capacity inequalities (RCIs) and framed capacity inequalities (FCIs).

Result: Experiments show reduced dual gap compared to existing neural separation method on random CVRP instances, and successful discovery of effective FCIs despite their challenging identification.

Conclusion: Test-time search with stochasticity enhances trained model performance at inference time, enabling more diverse cut generation and identification of previously challenging FCIs in CVRP.

Abstract: The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity
inequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based
separation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals
that the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently
sensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes
an alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time
through a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce
stochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the
previously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening
History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening
history to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed
capacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared
to the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers
effective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of
identifying such cuts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QUASAR is an agentic RL framework that uses tool-augmented LLMs to generate and optimize quantum circuits, addressing challenges in parameter precision and domain knowledge through quantum circuit verification and hierarchical rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based quantum circuit generation faces challenges with precise parameter values and lacks quantum domain knowledge, leading to low-quality circuits. There's a need for automated solutions that can optimize quantum circuits effectively.

Method: QUASAR combines tool-augmented LLMs with reinforcement learning, featuring quantum circuit verification using external simulators and a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism during RL training to improve circuit quality.

Result: QUASAR achieved 99.31% validity in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10, outperforming GPT-4o, GPT-5, DeepSeek-V3, and other SFT-only and RL-only baselines when augmenting a 4B LLM.

Conclusion: The proposed QUASAR framework successfully addresses quantum circuit generation challenges by integrating LLMs with quantum-specific tools and RL, demonstrating superior performance in generating valid and optimized quantum circuits.

Abstract: Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to
leverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model
(LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic
solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i)
parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal
performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of
quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii)
LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack
of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and
optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with
quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR
designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum
simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL
training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic
performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR
has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10,
outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several
supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AFFR framework combines few-shot federated optimization, energy-aware client scheduling, and secure aggregation to improve rare-disease diagnosis accuracy by 10% while reducing client dropouts by 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in rare-disease diagnosis including data scarcity, privacy concerns, and limited edge device resources.

Method: Integrates three pillars: few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning, energy-aware client scheduling, and secure aggregation with calibrated differential privacy.

Result: 10% improvement in accuracy compared to baseline FL, over 50% reduction in client dropouts without degrading convergence, and clinically acceptable privacy-utility trade-offs.

Conclusion: AFFR provides a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital
health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited
resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot
Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i)
few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited
patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device
dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with
calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike
prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a
modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental
evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%
improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client
dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,
privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These
findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy
federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

*Saravanan Venkatachalam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A unified forecasting system combining statistical, ML, and deep learning models with role-driven analytics for after-sales demand forecasting, featuring COVID-19 regime handling, Pareto-aware segmentation, and LLM-powered narratives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a practical after-sales demand forecasting system that moves beyond basic accuracy metrics to provide actionable insights, trend monitoring, and decision-focused analytics for inventory planning across global operations.

Method: Uses an ensemble of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models with exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators). Implements Pareto-aware segmentation for high-revenue items, horizon-aware ensembling with business-relevant losses, and includes LLMs for automated narrative generation and quality checks.

Result: Developed a reproducible workflow serving 90+ countries and ~6,000 parts, providing calibrated forecasts, performance scorecards, trend monitoring, and AI-generated narratives that enable planners to move from current accuracy assessment to proactive decision-making.

Conclusion: The system successfully closes the loop between forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions by providing comprehensive analytics, trend diagnostics, and actionable insights through a unified architecture that combines advanced modeling with business-focused interpretation.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand
forecasting and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble
of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven
analytics layer for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests
exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle,
seasonality) and treats COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part
forecasts with calibrated intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts
high-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while
horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g.,
WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused
insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias
decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family
hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A
trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months,
flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points
aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal
factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware
narratives and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business
definitions, automate quality checks and reconciliations, and translate
quantitative results into concise, explainable summaries for planners and
executives. The system exposes a reproducible workflow -- request
specification, model execution, database-backed artifacts, and AI-generated
narratives -- so planners can move from "How accurate are we now?" to "Where is
accuracy heading and which levers should we pull?", closing the loop between
forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions across more than 90 countries
and about 6,000 parts.

TL;DR: SMDS is a model-agnostic method that automatically discovers feature manifolds in language models, revealing various geometric structures like circles, lines, and clusters that support reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods focus on specific geometries for specific features and lack generalization, while the linear representation hypothesis suggests language models encode concepts as organized multidimensional manifolds.

Method: Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS) - a model-agnostic method to automatically discover feature manifolds, applied to temporal reasoning as a case study.

Result: Different features form various geometric structures (circles, lines, clusters) that consistently reflect concept properties, are stable across models, support reasoning, and dynamically reshape with context changes.

Conclusion: Feature manifolds play a functional role in entity-based reasoning, supporting that language models encode and transform structured representations through organized geometric structures.

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode
concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized,
multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific
geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce
Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to
automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning
as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric
structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on
these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they
represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support
reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.
Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds,
supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform
structured representations.

*Zach Studdiford,Timothy T. Rogers,Kushin Mukherjee,Siddharth Suresh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 70+ LLMs on a triplet similarity task to measure human-model representational alignment, finding instruction-finetuning and larger attention head dimensionality improve alignment, while multimodal pretraining and parameter size have limited effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks are inadequate for measuring representational alignment between humans and models, making it unclear which computational ingredients (architectures, fine-tuning methods, training datasets) are crucial for developing human-like representations.

Method: Evaluated over 70 models with varying computational ingredients on a triplet similarity task using concepts from THINGS database, comparing human and model representations to measure alignment.

Result: Instruction-finetuned models and those with larger attention head dimensionality showed highest human alignment. Multimodal pretraining and parameter size had limited impact. Existing benchmarks like MMLU capture some alignment variance but none fully account for alignment scores.

Conclusion: The findings identify key computational ingredients for advancing LLMs toward human conceptual models and reveal a benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation, showing current benchmarks are insufficient for capturing human-AI alignment.

Abstract: The ability to translate diverse patterns of inputs into structured patterns
of behavior has been thought to rest on both humans' and machines' ability to
learn robust representations of relevant concepts. The rapid advancement of
transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of
computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training
datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are
most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations.
Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring
representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores
unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming
useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set
of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a
triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences
for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS
database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that
undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of
attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining
and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between
alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some
benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for
capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully
accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their
insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings
help highlight the computational ingredients most essential for advancing LLMs
towards models of human conceptual representation and address a key
benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Activation-Deactivation (AD) paradigm and ConvAD mechanism for more robust black-box explanations of CNN image classifiers without requiring domain knowledge or retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box explainability methods rely on occluding input parts, creating out-of-distribution images and requiring domain knowledge to choose appropriate occlusion values, raising doubts about explanation quality.

Method: Proposes Activation-Deactivation (AD) paradigm that removes effects of occluded features by switching off corresponding model parts. Introduces ConvAD as a drop-in mechanism for any trained CNN that implements AD without changing decision-making process.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows AD explanations achieve up to 62.5% improvement in robustness compared to occlusion-based methods, with consistent improvements across datasets and model architectures using proxies of robustness, size, and confidence drop-off.

Conclusion: ConvAD provides more robust explanations without requiring domain knowledge or additional training/fine-tuning, addressing key limitations of current black-box explainability methods.

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of unfaithful rationales in Chain-of-Thought prompting and move beyond heuristic interpretability towards formal verification for more reliable AI systems.

Method: Extracting and mapping informal natural language steps from CoT reasoning into formal, typed proof structures using the Curry-Howard correspondence paradigm.

Result: Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a verifiable certificate of computational faithfulness.

Conclusion: The framework provides a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an
open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens
for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a
direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this
paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program,
where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We
operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the
informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure.
Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong,
verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond
heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides

Motivation: LLM safety is challenging due to lack of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it hard to obtain effective training signals for alignment.

Method: Safety Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL) transforms models' internal confidence into self-generated reward signals by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors when faced with harmful requests.

Result: SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates against 20+ jailbreak methods using only 15,000 unlabeled prompts, surpassing supervised methods while preserving performance on other benchmarks.

Conclusion: Effective alignment can emerge from within models, enabling autonomous AI safety mechanisms that scale without extensive human oversight.

Abstract: Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the
absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it
difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models
already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce
high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when
generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped
signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety
Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal
confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on
external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their
safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on
Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against
20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only
15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods
while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation
benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from
within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that
scale without extensive human oversight.

TL;DR: A two-layer production planning framework combining Constraint Programming for order-line allocation and Markov Decision Process for worker-line allocation to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for human-centric production planning that balances operational efficiency with workforce well-being, fairness, and individual worker constraints in industrial manufacturing settings.

Method: Two-layer framework: (1) Order-Line allocation using Constraint Programming for production scheduling, (2) Worker-Line allocation using Markov Decision Process integrating human factors. Three solution strategies (greedy, MCTS, RL) were implemented and compared.

Result: CP-based scheduling produced compact, feasible plans with low tardiness. MDP-based worker allocation significantly improved fairness and preference alignment. Domain experts validated effectiveness through 16 test sessions, with positive ratings for both components.

Conclusion: Combining CP with learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric production planning, enabling simultaneous optimization of throughput and workforce well-being in industrial manufacturing.

Abstract: This work presents a two-layer, human-centric production planning framework
designed to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in
industrial manufacturing. The first layer formulates the Order-Line allocation
as a Constraint Programming (CP) problem, generating high-utilization
production schedules that respect machine capacities, processing times, and due
dates. The second layer models Worker-Line allocation as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), integrating human factors such as worker preference, experience,
resilience, and medical constraints into the assignment process. Three solution
strategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared
across multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through
16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining
quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results
indicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible
production plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation
significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline
approaches. Domain experts rated both the Order-Line and Worker-Line components
as effective and highlighted opportunities to further refine the objective
function to penalize excessive earliness and improve continuity in worker
assignments. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining CP with
learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric
production planning. The approach enables simultaneous optimization of
throughput and workforce well-being, offering a practical foundation for fair
and efficient manufacturing scheduling in industrial settings.

Abstract: We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture
that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain
specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a
light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist

Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and
token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On
real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence
with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves
high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a

TL;DR: An LLM-centric agent framework for supply chain risk analysis that treats supply chains as knowledge graphs, uses network centrality for retrieval, and employs context shells to make quantitative data understandable to LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex multi-modal financial risk data, standard RAG oversimplifies relationships, and specialist models are costly and static.

Method: Treat supply chain network as knowledge graph, use graph traverser guided by network centrality scores, orchestrate graph retrieval with numerical factor tables and news streams, and employ context shells to embed raw figures in natural language.

Result: Enables generation of concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time without costly fine-tuning or dedicated graph database.

Conclusion: The framework provides a lightweight approach that makes quantitative financial risk data fully intelligible to LLMs while maintaining explainability and real-time performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and
network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are
costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for
supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent
duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain
network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for
retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently
extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture
orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables
and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive
templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative
data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model
to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time
without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

*Harry Dong,David Brandfonbrener,Eryk Helenowski,Yun He,Mrinal Kumar,Han Fang,Yuejie Chi,Karthik Abinav Sankararaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bridge enables parallel LLM inference by generating interdependent responses rather than independent ones, improving response quality and consistency with minimal additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parallel LLM inference generates responses independently, wasting potential information sharing between parallel generations and inefficiently using compute resources.

Method: Bridge treats batched LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices, allowing responses to be generated interdependently with only 2.8%-5.1% new parameters.

Result: Bridge improves relative mean accuracy gains from reinforcement learning by up to 50%, boosts consistency of correct responses, and scales to any generation width with better performance than independent generations.

Conclusion: Bridge unlocks a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages information between sequences and is compatible with any post-generation aggregation technique.

Abstract: Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of $N>1$ responses for
a single input prompt. However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be
generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and
leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others.
This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used
in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose
Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched
LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only
a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean
accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50%
and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any
generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations,
unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages
information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation
technique.

*Hai Huang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Directed Information γ-covering is a redundancy-aware context engineering framework that uses directed information to measure predictive relationships between text chunks, enabling efficient context selection with provable guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of redundancy in context selection for LLMs by developing a principled framework that can identify and eliminate redundant information while preserving query-relevant content.

Method: Formulates context selection as a γ-cover problem using directed information (causal mutual information) to measure asymmetric predictiveness between chunks. A greedy algorithm with provable approximation guarantees is proposed, leveraging submodular set cover properties and enforcing diversity margins.

Result: Experiments on HotpotQA show consistent improvements over BM25 baseline, with particular advantages in hard-decision scenarios like context compression and single-slot prompt selection. The method is query-agnostic and can be computed offline.

Conclusion: Directed Information γ-covering provides a principled, self-organizing backbone for modern LLM pipelines, offering efficient redundancy-aware context engineering with theoretical guarantees and practical performance benefits.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Directed Information $\gamma$-covering}, a simple but
general framework for redundancy-aware context engineering. Directed
information (DI), a causal analogue of mutual information, measures asymmetric
predictiveness between chunks. If $\operatorname{DI}_{i \to j} \ge H(C_j) -
\gamma$, then $C_i$ suffices to represent $C_j$ up to $\gamma$ bits. Building
on this criterion, we formulate context selection as a $\gamma$-cover problem
and propose a greedy algorithm with provable guarantees: it preserves query
information within bounded slack, inherits $(1+\ln n)$ and $(1-1/e)$
approximations from submodular set cover, and enforces a diversity margin.
Importantly, building the $\gamma$-cover is \emph{query-agnostic}: it incurs no
online cost and can be computed once offline and amortized across all queries.
Experiments on HotpotQA show that $\gamma$-covering consistently improves over
BM25, a competitive baseline, and provides clear advantages in hard-decision
regimes such as context compression and single-slot prompt selection. These
results establish DI $\gamma$-covering as a principled, self-organizing
backbone for modern LLM pipelines.

Motivation: To develop an integrated system that combines radar sensing and communication capabilities using OTFS signals, enabling simultaneous target detection, vital sign monitoring, and target classification in a single platform.

Method: Uses OTFS communication signals for radar sensing with fast algorithms for range/speed detection, self-interference cancellation, and two approaches for human/non-human classification (signal processing and machine learning). Implemented with SDR technology.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate effective detection of range, speed, and vital signs (breathing rate, heartbeat) in both human and mobile robot scenarios, along with successful human/non-human target distinction.

Conclusion: The proposed JRC system with OTFS signals successfully integrates radar and communication functions, enabling multi-target detection, vital sign monitoring, and target classification with practical implementation using SDR technology.

Abstract: We propose an Joint Radar and Communication (JRC) system that utilizes the
Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) signals. The system features a fast

for monitoring human vital signs, such as breathing rate and heartbeat.
Furthermore, we explore two approaches for distinguishing between human and
nonhuman targets: one based on signal processing and the other based on machine

TL;DR: Proposed layered normalized min-sum (LNMS) decoding with syndrome-guided bit flipping (SGBF) for FDPC codes, achieving significant coding gains over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDPC codes show improved performance over 5G LDPC codes in high-rate regimes, but need enhanced decoding algorithms to fully exploit their potential.

Method: LNMS decoder uses conflict graph coloring for layered scheduling, with SGBF method that combines LLR magnitudes and syndrome-derived error counts to identify unreliable bits for flipping.

Result: Achieves ~0.5dB gain over standalone LNMS at FER 10^-3, and 0.75-1.5dB gains over polar codes and 5G-LDPC codes under belief propagation decoding.

Conclusion: The proposed LNMS with SGBF decoder significantly enhances FDPC code performance, making them superior to state-of-the-art codes in high-rate applications.

Abstract: Fair-density parity-check (FDPC) codes have been recently introduced
demonstrating improved performance compared to low-density parity-check (LDPC)
codes standardized in 5G systems particularly in high-rate regimes. In this
paper, we introduce a layered normalized min-sum (LNMS) message-passing
decoding algorithm for the FDPC codes. We also introduce a syndrome-guided bit
flipping (SGBF) method to enhance the error-correction performance of our
proposed decoder. The LNMS decoder leverages conflict graph coloring for
efficient layered scheduling, enabling faster convergence by grouping
non-conflicting check nodes and updating variable nodes immediately after each
layer. In the event of decoding failure, the SGBF method is activated,
utilizing a novel reliability metric that combines log-likelihood ratio (LLR)
magnitudes and syndrome-derived error counts to identify the least reliable
bits. A set of candidate sequences is then generated by performing single-bit
flips at these positions, with each candidate re-decoded via LNMS. The optimal
candidate is selected based on the minimum syndrome weight. Extensive
simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed decoder.
Numerical simulations on FDPC$(256,192)$ code with a bit-flipping set size of
$T = 128$ and a maximum of $5$ iterations demonstrate that the proposed decoder
achieves approximately a $0.5\,\mathrm{dB}$ coding gain over standalone LNMS
decoding at a frame error rate (FER) of $10^{-3}$, while providing coding gains
of $0.75-1.5\,\mathrm{dB}$ over other state-of-the-art codes including polar
codes and 5G-LDPC codes at the same length and rate and also under belief
propagation decoding.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper explores uncertainty-aware deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis, incorporating rejection mechanisms for low-confidence predictions to improve reliability in clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis create uncertainty and risk in clinical practice when they provide predictions without confidence indications, necessitating more reliable approaches.

Method: The study uses uncertainty-aware deep learning models with rejection mechanisms to defer low-confidence predictions, employing Variational Bayesian models and evaluating performance through accuracy on accepted predictions, coverage, rejection-ratio, and Expected Calibration Error.

Result: Results show a trade-off between prediction coverage and reliability, with Variational Bayesian models adopting conservative strategies by rejecting uncertain predictions, demonstrating a clear accuracy-caution trade-off.

Conclusion: Uncertainty estimation and selective rejection significantly improve model reliability for safety-critical diagnostic applications, making uncertainty-aware models more suitable for clinical use in diabetic retinopathy diagnosis.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of visual impairment, and
effective treatment options depend heavily on timely and accurate diagnosis.
Deep learning models have demonstrated great success identifying DR from
retinal images. However, relying only on predictions made by models, without
any indication of model confidence, creates uncertainty and poses significant
risk in clinical settings. This paper investigates an alternative in
uncertainty-aware deep learning models, including a rejection mechanism to
reject low-confidence predictions, contextualized by deferred decision-making
in clinical practice. The results show there is a trade-off between prediction
coverage and coverage reliability. The Variational Bayesian model adopted a
more conservative strategy when predicting DR, subsequently rejecting the
uncertain predictions. The model is evaluated by means of important performance
metrics such as Accuracy on accepted predictions, the proportion of accepted
cases (coverage), the rejection-ratio, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE).
The findings also demonstrate a clear trade-off between accuracy and caution,
establishing that the use of uncertainty estimation and selective rejection
improves the model's reliability in safety-critical diagnostic use cases.

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease is critical for effective
clinical intervention, particularly in distinguishing it from Mild Cognitive
Impairment, a prodromal stage marked by subtle structural changes. In this
study, we propose a hybrid deep learning ensemble framework for Alzheimer
Disease classification using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Gray and
white matter slices are used as inputs to three pretrained convolutional neural
networks such as ResNet50, NASNet, and MobileNet, each fine tuned through an
end to end process. To further enhance performance, we incorporate a stacked
ensemble learning strategy with a meta learner and weighted averaging to
optimally combine the base models. Evaluated on the Alzheimer Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, the proposed method achieves state of the art
accuracy of 99.21% for Alzheimer Disease vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment and
91.0% for Mild Cognitive Impairment vs. Normal Controls, outperforming
conventional transfer learning and baseline ensemble methods. To improve
interpretability in image based diagnostics, we integrate Explainable AI
techniques by Gradient weighted Class Activation, which generates heatmaps and
attribution maps that highlight critical regions in gray and white matter
slices, revealing structural biomarkers that influence model decisions. These
results highlight the frameworks potential for robust and scalable clinical
decision support in neurodegenerative disease diagnostics.

Motivation: To support continuous stroke rehabilitation integrated with daily living through home-based solutions.

Method: System with RGB-D camera, wearable sensors, mobile app for guidance, and AI server using RAST-G@ model (ST-GCN with transformer attention) for movement assessment.

Result: RAST-G@ improves over baselines on KIMORE and NRC datasets in MAD, RMSE, and MAPE metrics, providing quantitative rehabilitation assessment.

Conclusion: The system offers scalable approach for quantitative and consistent domiciliary rehabilitation assessment with patient-centered feedback.

Abstract: Effective stroke recovery requires continuous rehabilitation integrated with
daily living. To support this need, we propose a home-based rehabilitation
exercise and feedback system. The system consists of (1) hardware setup with
RGB-D camera and wearable sensors to capture Stroke movements, (2) a mobile
application for exercise guidance, and (3) an AI server for assessment and
feedback. When Stroke user exercises following the application guidance, the
system records skeleton sequences, which are then Assessed by the deep learning
model, RAST-G@. The model employs a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network
(ST-GCN) to extract skeletal features and integrates transformer-based temporal
attention to figure out action quality. For system implementation, we
constructed the NRC dataset, include 10 upper-limb activities of daily living
(ADL) and 5 range-of-motion (ROM) collected from stroke and non-disabled
participants, with Score annotations provided by licensed physiotherapists.
Results on the KIMORE and NRC datasets show that RAST-G@ improves over baseline
in terms of MAD, RMSE, and MAPE. Furthermore, the system provides user feedback
that combines patient-centered assessment and monitoring. The results
demonstrate that the proposed system offers a scalable approach for
quantitative and consistent domiciliary rehabilitation assessment.

Method: Extends InfoVAE to explicitly maximize mutual information between 3D brain MRI images and latent variables, producing compact, structured embeddings that retain clinically meaningful content.

Result: Learned latents support accurate brain-age and SDMT regression, preserve key medical attributes, form intuitive clusters, and consistently outperform other VAE variants across reconstruction and prediction tasks.

Conclusion: InfoVAE-Med3D offers a practical path toward MRI-based biomarkers and more transparent analysis of cognitive deterioration by uniting predictive performance with interpretability.

Abstract: We present InfoVAE-Med3D, a latent-representation learning approach for 3D
brain MRI that targets interpretable biomarkers of cognitive decline. Standard
statistical models and shallow machine learning often lack power, while most
deep learning methods behave as black boxes. Our method extends InfoVAE to
explicitly maximize mutual information between images and latent variables,
producing compact, structured embeddings that retain clinically meaningful
content. We evaluate on two cohorts: a large healthy-control dataset (n=6527)
with chronological age, and a clinical multiple sclerosis dataset from Charles
University in Prague (n=904) with age and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)
scores. The learned latents support accurate brain-age and SDMT regression,
preserve key medical attributes, and form intuitive clusters that aid
interpretation. Across reconstruction and downstream prediction tasks,
InfoVAE-Med3D consistently outperforms other VAE variants, indicating stronger
information capture in the embedding space. By uniting predictive performance
with interpretability, InfoVAE-Med3D offers a practical path toward MRI-based
biomarkers and more transparent analysis of cognitive deterioration in
neurological disease.

TL;DR: DPsurv is a dual-prototype WSI evidential fusion network for cancer survival analysis that provides uncertainty-aware survival intervals and interpretable predictions through patch prototype assignment maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSI survival analysis methods have limited interpretability and often ignore predictive uncertainty in heterogeneous slide images, which is crucial for clinical trustworthiness.

Method: Dual-prototype whole-slide image evidential fusion network that outputs uncertainty-aware survival intervals and enables interpretation through patch prototype assignment maps, component prototypes, and component-wise relative risk aggregation.

Result: Achieved highest mean concordance index and lowest mean integrated Brier score on five publicly available datasets, validating effectiveness and reliability.

Conclusion: DPsurv provides transparent interpretation at feature, reasoning, and decision levels, enhancing trustworthiness and interpretability of survival predictions.

Abstract: Pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) are widely used for cancer survival
analysis because of their comprehensive histopathological information at both
cellular and tissue levels, enabling quantitative, large-scale, and
prognostically rich tumor feature analysis. However, most existing methods in
WSI survival analysis struggle with limited interpretability and often overlook
predictive uncertainty in heterogeneous slide images. In this paper, we propose
DPsurv, a dual-prototype whole-slide image evidential fusion network that
outputs uncertainty-aware survival intervals, while enabling interpretation of
predictions through patch prototype assignment maps, component prototypes, and
component-wise relative risk aggregation. Experiments on five publicly
available datasets achieve the highest mean concordance index and the lowest
mean integrated Brier score, validating the effectiveness and reliability of
DPsurv. The interpretation of prediction results provides transparency at the
feature, reasoning, and decision levels, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness
and interpretability of DPsurv.

*Kiran Nijjer,Ryan Bui,Derek Jiu,Adnan Ahmed,Peter Wang,Benjamin Liu,Kevin Zhu,Lilly Zhu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SkinGPT-4 shows performance bias favoring lighter skin tones, with significant disparities in diagnostic accuracy across Fitzpatrick skin types. Custom fine-tuned models achieved better fairness with reduced bias across skin tones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance biases in SkinGPT-4 across different skin tones and develop fairer models for skin disease classification, particularly for underserved communities.

Method: Evaluated SkinGPT-4 on SCIN dataset across skin tones, developed fine-tuned models for custom classification tasks, and implemented bias mitigation strategies. Clinical evaluation by dermatologists assessed diagnostic accuracy, utility, and fairness metrics.

Result: SkinGPT-4 showed demographic parity of 0.10 with 0.10-0.15 disparities between lightest and darkest tones, and 17.8% hallucination rate. Custom models achieved F1=0.75, precision=0.78, AUROC=0.78, with improved fairness (demographic parity=0.75).

Conclusion: Large vision-language models exhibit skin tone bias, but fine-tuning existing backbones can create accurate, fair models for skin disease classification with robust fairness across all Fitzpatrick types.

Abstract: SkinGPT-4, a large vision-language model, leverages annotated skin disease
images to augment clinical workflows in underserved communities. However, its
training dataset predominantly represents lighter skin tones, limiting
diagnostic accuracy for darker tones. Here, we evaluated performance biases in
SkinGPT-4 across skin tones on common skin diseases, including eczema,
allergic-contact dermatitis, and psoriasis using the open-sourced SCIN dataset.
We leveraged the SkinGPT-4 backbone to develop finetuned models for custom skin
disease classification tasks and explored bias mitigation strategies. Clinical
evaluation by board-certified dermatologists on six relevant skin diseases from
300 SCIN cases assessed images for diagnostic accuracy, informativity,
physician utility, and patient utility. Model fairness metrics, including
demographic parity and equalized odds, were calculated across skin tones.
SkinGPT-4 achieved an average demographic parity of 0.10 across Fitzpatrick
types, with notable differences of 0.10-0.15 between lightest and darkest tones
across evaluation metrics. Model hallucinations in artifacts and anatomy
occurred at a rate of 17.8. Our customized models achieved average F1,
precision, and AUROC of 0.75, 0.78, and 0.78 across visually similar disease
pairs. Fairness analysis showed an average demographic parity of 0.75, with a
maximum disparity of 0.21 across skin tones. The best model achieved parity
scores of 0.83, 0.83, 0.76, 0.89, 0.90, and 0.90 for Fitzpatrick I-VI,
indicating robust fairness. Large language models such as SkinGPT-4 showed
weaker performance on darker tones. Model biases exist across evaluation
criteria, and hallucinations may affect diagnostic efficacy. These findings
demonstrate the efficacy of training accurate, fair models using existing
backbones for custom skin disease classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Osteoporosis is a global health issue that can be prevented through early detection via imaging, but the AI literature in this field is fragmented and needs unification to accelerate patient-centered innovation.

Method: The authors use a PRISMA-guided systematic review approach and introduce a tri-axial framework that couples imaging modalities (DXA, X-ray, CT, MRI) with clinical tasks and AI methodologies (classical ML, CNNs, transformers, self-supervised learning, explainable AI).

Result: The survey synthesizes cross-study insights on key challenges including data scarcity, external validation, and interpretability issues in osteoporosis AI research.

Conclusion: This review provides AI scientists, medical imaging researchers, and clinicians with a clear framework and actionable research directions to advance rigorous, patient-centered innovation in osteoporosis care.

Abstract: Osteoporosis silently erodes skeletal integrity worldwide; however, early
detection through imaging can prevent most fragility fractures. Artificial
intelligence (AI) methods now mine routine Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry
(DXA), X-ray, Computed Tomography (CT), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
scans for subtle, clinically actionable markers, but the literature is
fragmented. This survey unifies the field through a tri-axial framework that
couples imaging modalities with clinical tasks and AI methodologies (classical
machine learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers,
self-supervised learning, and explainable AI). Following a concise clinical and
technical primer, we detail our Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-guided search strategy, introduce the
taxonomy via a roadmap figure, and synthesize cross-study insights on data
scarcity, external validation, and interpretability. By identifying emerging
trends, open challenges, and actionable research directions, this review
provides AI scientists, medical imaging researchers, and musculoskeletal
clinicians with a clear compass to accelerate rigorous, patient-centered
innovation in osteoporosis care. The project page of this survey can also be

### [335] [Observer-Usable Information as a Task-specific Image Quality Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00298)
*Changjie Lu,Sourya Sengupta,Hua Li,Mark A. Anastasio*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: V-information (V-info) is proposed as a new objective image quality metric that quantifies task-relevant information accessible to sub-ideal observers, overcoming limitations of traditional task-specific information measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional task-based image quality measures like task-specific information (TSI) assume ideal observers and don't quantify information actually usable by sub-ideal observers, limiting practical utility.

Method: V-info is applied to a stylized MRI restoration problem to quantify signal detection/discrimination performance, comparing it with ROC curve analysis for binary tasks and extending to multi-class tasks.

Result: V-info correlates with AUC for binary tasks, works for multi-class tasks where ROC analysis is difficult, and shows greater sensitivity when conventional metrics saturate.

Conclusion: V-info represents a complementary objective image quality measure that can enhance conventional signal detection theory-based metrics, particularly for multi-class tasks and scenarios where traditional metrics reach saturation.

Abstract: Objective, task-based, measures of image quality (IQ) have been widely
advocated for assessing and optimizing medical imaging technologies. Besides
signal detection theory-based measures, information-theoretic quantities have
been proposed to quantify task-based IQ. For example, task-specific information
(TSI), defined as the mutual information between an image and task variable,
represents an optimal measure of how informative an image is for performing a
specified task. However, like the ideal observer from signal detection theory,
TSI does not quantify the amount of task-relevant information in an image that
can be exploited by a sub-ideal observer. A recently proposed relaxation of
TSI, termed predictive V-information (V-info), removes this limitation and can
quantify the utility of an image with consideration of a specified family of
sub-ideal observers. In this study, for the first time, V-info is proposed and
investigated as an objective, task-specific, IQ metric. To corroborate its
usefulness, a stylized magnetic resonance image restoration problem is
considered in which V-info is employed to quantify signal detection or
discrimination performance. The presented results show that V-info correlates
with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for binary
tasks, while being readily applicable to multi-class (>2) tasks where ROC
analysis is challenging. Notably, V-info exhibits greater sensitivity in
scenarios where conventional metrics saturate. These findings demonstrate that
V-info represents a new objective IQ measure that can complement conventional
signal detection theory-based ones.

*Pierre Fayolle,Alexandre Bône,Noëlie Debs,Pihlippe Robert,Pascal Bourdon,Remy Guillevin,David Helbert*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning framework for virtual contrast enhancement of MRI images using longitudinal data from prior full-dose scans to reduce gadolinium contrast agent usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about gadolinium retention and accumulation in tissues, especially for diseases requiring frequent monitoring, necessitate strategies to reduce contrast agent dosage while maintaining diagnostic quality.

Method: Proposed a deep learning model that uses longitudinal information by incorporating prior full-dose MRI examinations from the same patient to enhance low-dose acquisitions into virtual full-dose images.

Result: Longitudinal approach significantly improved image quality across multiple reconstruction metrics compared to non-longitudinal single session models, and showed robustness with varying simulated contrast doses.

Conclusion: Integrating prior imaging history into deep learning-based virtual contrast enhancement can reduce gadolinium contrast agent usage without compromising diagnostic utility, enabling safer longitudinal monitoring in clinical MRI practice.

Abstract: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) to enhance lesion detection and characterisation,
particularly in the field of neuro-oncology. Nevertheless, concerns regarding
gadolinium retention and accumulation in brain and body tissues, most notably
for diseases that require close monitoring and frequent GBCA injection, have
led to the need for strategies to reduce dosage. In this study, a deep learning
framework is proposed for the virtual contrast enhancement of full-dose
post-contrast T1-weighted MRI images from corresponding low-dose acquisitions.
The contribution of the presented model is its utilisation of longitudinal
information, which is achieved by incorporating a prior full-dose MRI
examination from the same patient. A comparative evaluation against a
non-longitudinal single session model demonstrated that the longitudinal
approach significantly improves image quality across multiple reconstruction
metrics. Furthermore, experiments with varying simulated contrast doses
confirmed the robustness of the proposed method. These results emphasize the
potential of integrating prior imaging history into deep learning-based virtual
contrast enhancement pipelines to reduce GBCA usage without compromising
diagnostic utility, thus paving the way for safer, more sustainable
longitudinal monitoring in clinical MRI practice.

*Hidenori Takeshima,Shuki Maruyama*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A fast and precise method for searching rectangular tumor regions in brain MR images using U-Net with EfficientNet encoder and summed-area tables for 3D full search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a fast and precise method for searching rectangular tumor regions in brain tumor images, addressing the need for efficient brain tumor diagnosis using MRI systems.

Method: Uses U-Net with EfficientNet encoder for segmentation and summed-area tables for fast 3D full search. The search metric prioritizes cubes over oblongs and assigns better values for higher tumor fractions.

Result: Proposed computation (8 seconds) was 100-500 times faster than conventional computation (11-40 minutes). Proposed metric achieved higher tumor fractions and preferred cubes over oblongs compared to conventional metric.

Conclusion: The method is promising for fast and precise rectangular tumor region search, with significant speed improvements and better quality region assignments for brain tumor diagnosis.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a fast and precise method for searching rectangular
regions in brain tumor images. Methods: The authors propose a new method for
searching rectangular tumor regions in brain MR images. The proposed method
consisted of a segmentation network and a fast search method with a
user-controllable search metric. As the segmentation network, the U-Net whose
encoder was replaced by the EfficientNet was used. In the fast search method,
summed-area tables were used for accelerating sums of voxels in rectangular
regions. Use of the summed-area tables enabled exhaustive search of the 3D
offset (3D full search). The search metric was designed for giving priority to
cubes over oblongs, and assigning better values for higher tumor fractions even
if they exceeded target tumor fractions. The proposed computation and metric
were compared with those used in a conventional method using the Brain Tumor
Image Segmentation dataset. Results: When the 3D full search was used, the
proposed computation (8 seconds) was 100-500 times faster than the conventional
computation (11-40 minutes). When the user-controllable parts of the search
metrics were changed variously, the tumor fractions of the proposed metric were
higher than those of the conventional metric. In addition, the conventional
metric preferred oblongs whereas the proposed metric preferred cubes.
Conclusion: The proposed method is promising for implementing fast and precise
search of rectangular tumor regions, which is useful for brain tumor diagnosis
using MRI systems. The proposed computation reduced processing times of the 3D
full search, and the proposed metric improved the quality of the assigned
rectangular tumor regions.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: U-DFA is a unified DINOv2-Unet architecture with Local-Global Fusion Adapter that achieves state-of-the-art medical image segmentation with only 33% trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN-based models fail to capture global context, transformer-CNN hybrids don't effectively fuse local and global features, and existing VLMs suffer from domain gap and high computational costs in medical imaging.

Method: Proposes U-DFA with novel Local-Global Fusion Adapter (LGFA) modules that inject spatial features from CNN-based Spatial Pattern Adapter into frozen DINOv2 blocks at multiple stages.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Synapse and ACDC datasets with only 33% of trainable model parameters.

Conclusion: U-DFA is a robust and scalable framework for medical image segmentation across multiple modalities.

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in overall diagnosis
and is one of the most essential tasks in the diagnostic pipeline. CNN-based
models, despite their extensive use, suffer from a local receptive field and
fail to capture the global context. A common approach that combines CNNs with
transformers attempts to bridge this gap but fails to effectively fuse the
local and global features. With the recent emergence of VLMs and foundation
models, they have been adapted for downstream medical imaging tasks; however,
they suffer from an inherent domain gap and high computational cost. To this
end, we propose U-DFA, a unified DINOv2-Unet encoder-decoder architecture that
integrates a novel Local-Global Fusion Adapter (LGFA) to enhance segmentation
performance. LGFA modules inject spatial features from a CNN-based Spatial
Pattern Adapter (SPA) module into frozen DINOv2 blocks at multiple stages,
enabling effective fusion of high-level semantic and spatial features. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Synapse and ACDC datasets
with only 33\% of the trainable model parameters. These results demonstrate
that U-DFA is a robust and scalable framework for medical image segmentation
across multiple modalities.
