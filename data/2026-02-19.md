### [1] [Egocentric Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15892)
*Maijunxian Wang,Yijiang Li,Bingyang Wang,Tianwei Zhao,Ran Ji,Qingying Gao,Emmy Liu,Hokin Deng,Dezhi Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlipSet is a new benchmark testing Level-2 visual perspective taking in vision-language models, revealing systematic egocentric bias where most models perform below chance and reproduce camera viewpoints instead of simulating character rotations from another agent's perspective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual perspective taking is fundamental to social cognition, but current vision-language models' ability to perform Level-2 visual perspective taking (simulating how the world appears from another's viewpoint) remains underexplored and needs systematic evaluation.

Method: Created FlipSet benchmark requiring models to simulate 180-degree rotations of 2D character strings from another agent's perspective, isolating spatial transformation from 3D scene complexity. Evaluated 103 vision-language models and conducted control experiments to test theory-of-mind accuracy and mental rotation separately.

Result: Revealed systematic egocentric bias: vast majority of models perform below chance, with ~75% of errors reproducing camera viewpoint. Models show compositional deficit - high theory-of-mind accuracy and above-chance mental rotation in isolation, but catastrophic failure when integration required.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack mechanisms to bind social awareness to spatial operations, indicating fundamental limitations in model-based spatial reasoning. FlipSet provides cognitively grounded testbed for diagnosing perspective-taking capabilities in multimodal systems.

Abstract: Visual perspective taking--inferring how the world appears from another's viewpoint--is foundational to social cognition. We introduce FlipSet, a diagnostic benchmark for Level-2 visual perspective taking (L2 VPT) in vision-language models. The task requires simulating 180-degree rotations of 2D character strings from another agent's perspective, isolating spatial transformation from 3D scene complexity. Evaluating 103 VLMs reveals systematic egocentric bias: the vast majority perform below chance, with roughly three-quarters of errors reproducing the camera viewpoint. Control experiments expose a compositional deficit--models achieve high theory-of-mind accuracy and above-chance mental rotation in isolation, yet fail catastrophically when integration is required. This dissociation indicates that current VLMs lack the mechanisms needed to bind social awareness to spatial operations, suggesting fundamental limitations in model-based spatial reasoning. FlipSet provides a cognitively grounded testbed for diagnosing perspective-taking capabilities in multimodal systems.

### [2] [Detecting Deepfakes with Multivariate Soft Blending and CLIP-based Image-Text Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15903)
*Jingwei Li,Jiaxin Tong,Pengfei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSBA-CLIP: A novel deepfake detection framework using CLIP-guided forgery intensity estimation and multivariate soft blending augmentation to improve generalization across diverse forgery methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods suffer from limited accuracy and poor generalization due to distribution shifts among samples generated by diverse forgery techniques. The need for robust detection of highly realistic facial forgeries drives this research.

Method: Proposes MSBA-CLIP framework with two key components: 1) Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation (MSBA) that synthesizes images by blending forgeries from multiple methods with random weights to force learning of generalizable patterns, and 2) Multivariate Forgery Intensity Estimation (MFIE) module that uses CLIP's multimodal alignment capabilities to capture subtle forgery traces and explicitly guide learning of features related to varied forgery modes and intensities.

Result: State-of-the-art performance: In-domain tests show 3.32% Accuracy and 4.02% AUC improvements over best baseline. Cross-domain evaluations across five datasets achieve average AUC gain of 3.27%. Ablation studies confirm efficacy of both proposed components.

Conclusion: The MSBA-CLIP framework presents a significant step towards more generalizable and robust deepfake detection, though it relies on a large vision-language model which entails higher computational cost.

Abstract: The proliferation of highly realistic facial forgeries necessitates robust detection methods. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited accuracy and poor generalization due to significant distribution shifts among samples generated by diverse forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation with CLIP-guided Forgery Intensity Estimation (MSBA-CLIP) framework. Our method leverages the multimodal alignment capabilities of CLIP to capture subtle forgery traces. We introduce a Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation (MSBA) strategy that synthesizes images by blending forgeries from multiple methods with random weights, forcing the model to learn generalizable patterns. Furthermore, a dedicated Multivariate Forgery Intensity Estimation (MFIE) module is designed to explicitly guide the model in learning features related to varied forgery modes and intensities. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On in-domain tests, our method improves Accuracy and AUC by 3.32\% and 4.02\%, respectively, over the best baseline. In cross-domain evaluations across five datasets, it achieves an average AUC gain of 3.27\%. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of both proposed components. While the reliance on a large vision-language model entails higher computational cost, our work presents a significant step towards more generalizable and robust deepfake detection.

*June Moh Goo,Zichao Zeng,Jan Boehm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First comprehensive survey of LiDAR super-resolution methods for autonomous driving, categorizing approaches into four types and analyzing trends toward practical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: Concludes by identifying open challenges and future research directions for advancing LiDAR super-resolution technology, emphasizing the need for practical deployment solutions in autonomous driving.

Abstract: LiDAR sensors are often considered essential for autonomous driving, but high-resolution sensors remain expensive while affordable low-resolution sensors produce sparse point clouds that miss critical details. LiDAR super-resolution addresses this challenge by using deep learning to enhance sparse point clouds, bridging the gap between different sensor types and enabling cross-sensor compatibility in real-world deployments. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of LiDAR super-resolution methods for autonomous driving. Despite the importance of practical deployment, no systematic review has been conducted until now. We organize existing approaches into four categories: CNN-based architectures, model-based deep unrolling, implicit representation methods, and Transformer and Mamba-based approaches. We establish fundamental concepts including data representations, problem formulation, benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics. Current trends include the adoption of range image representation for efficient processing, extreme model compression and the development of resolution-flexible architectures. Recent research prioritizes real-time inference and cross-sensor generalization for practical deployment. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future research directions for advancing LiDAR super-resolution technology.

### [4] [MaS-VQA: A Mask-and-Select Framework for Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15915)
*Xianwei Mao,Kai Ye,Sheng Zhou,Nan Zhang,Haikuan Huang,Bin Li,Jiajun Bu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaS-VQA is a selection-driven framework for KB-VQA that filters noisy external knowledge and activates relevant internal knowledge through joint pruning of irrelevant image regions and knowledge fragments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KB-VQA faces challenges with noisy retrieved knowledge (irrelevant/misaligned with visual content) and uncontrollable internal model knowledge, limiting reasoning effectiveness and answer accuracy when naively aggregated.

Method: Proposes MaS-VQA with Mask-and-Select mechanism that jointly prunes irrelevant image regions and weakly relevant knowledge fragments to create compact multimodal knowledge, then uses this filtered knowledge to guide activation of internal knowledge in constrained semantic space.

Result: Experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek show consistent performance gains across multiple MLLM backbones, with ablations verifying that the selection mechanism effectively reduces noise and enhances knowledge utilization.

Conclusion: The framework enables complementary co-modeling of explicit and implicit knowledge through tight coupling of knowledge filtering and reasoning, leading to robust answer prediction in KB-VQA.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) requires models to answer questions by integrating visual information with external knowledge. However, retrieved knowledge is often noisy, partially irrelevant, or misaligned with the visual content, while internal model knowledge is difficult to control and interpret. Naive aggregation of these sources limits reasoning effectiveness and reduces answer accuracy. To address this, we propose MaS-VQA, a selection-driven framework that tightly couples explicit knowledge filtering with implicit knowledge reasoning. MaS-VQA first retrieves candidate passages and applies a Mask-and-Select mechanism to jointly prune irrelevant image regions and weakly relevant knowledge fragments, producing compact, high-signal multimodal knowledge . This filtered knowledge then guides the activation of internal knowledge in a constrained semantic space, enabling complementary co-modeling of explicit and implicit knowledge for robust answer prediction. Experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate consistent performance gains across multiple MLLM backbones, and ablations verify that the selection mechanism effectively reduces noise and enhances knowledge utilization.

### [5] [EarthSpatialBench: Benchmarking Spatial Reasoning Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs on Earth Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15918)
*Zelin Xu,Yupu Zhang,Saugat Adhikari,Saiful Islam,Tingsong Xiao,Zibo Liu,Shigang Chen,Da Yan,Zhe Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EarthSpatialBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in multimodal LLMs on Earth imagery, addressing gaps in quantitative direction/distance reasoning, topological relations, and complex geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial reasoning on Earth imagery has lagged behind other domains, lacking support for quantitative direction/distance reasoning, systematic topological relations, and complex object geometries beyond bounding boxes, which is crucial for embodied AI and agentic systems interacting with the physical world.

Method: Proposed EarthSpatialBench benchmark containing over 325K question-answer pairs spanning: qualitative/quantitative spatial distance/direction reasoning, systematic topological relations, single-object/pair/compositional aggregate group queries, and object references via textual descriptions, visual overlays, and explicit geometry coordinates (bounding boxes, polylines, polygons).

Result: Extensive experiments on both open-source and proprietary models identified limitations in MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities on Earth imagery.

Conclusion: EarthSpatialBench fills a critical gap in benchmarking spatial reasoning for MLLMs on Earth imagery, enabling comprehensive evaluation of capabilities needed for precise interaction with the physical world in embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Benchmarking spatial reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has attracted growing interest in computer vision due to its importance for embodied AI and other agentic systems that require precise interaction with the physical world. However, spatial reasoning on Earth imagery has lagged behind, as it uniquely involves grounding objects in georeferenced images and quantitatively reasoning about distances, directions, and topological relations using both visual cues and vector geometry coordinates (e.g., 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons). Existing benchmarks for Earth imagery primarily focus on 2D spatial grounding, image captioning, and coarse spatial relations (e.g., simple directional or proximity cues). They lack support for quantitative direction and distance reasoning, systematic topological relations, and complex object geometries beyond bounding boxes. To fill this gap, we propose \textbf{EarthSpatialBench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in MLLMs on Earth imagery. The benchmark contains over 325K question-answer pairs spanning: (1) qualitative and quantitative reasoning about spatial distance and direction; (2) systematic topological relations; (3) single-object queries, object-pair queries, and compositional aggregate group queries; and (4) object references expressed via textual descriptions, visual overlays, and explicit geometry coordinates, including 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons. We conducted extensive experiments on both open-source and proprietary models to identify limitations in the spatial reasoning of MLLMs.

### [7] [Visual Memory Injection Attacks for Multi-Turn Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15927)
*Christian Schlarmann,Matthias Hein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack manipulates LVLMs through perturbed images in multi-turn conversations, enabling targeted user manipulation while appearing normal on regular prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The security of generative large vision-language models (LVLMs) in long-context multi-turn settings is largely unexplored, despite their growing user base and impressive performance gains. The paper addresses the realistic threat scenario where manipulated images uploaded to social media/web can be used to attack users who download and use them with LVLMs.

Method: Proposes Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack where a manipulated image causes LVLMs to behave normally on regular prompts but outputs specific prescribed target messages when users give triggering prompts. The attack is designed to be effective even after long multi-turn conversations, unlike previous single-turn attacks.

Result: Demonstrates successful attacks on several recent open-weight LVLMs, showing that large-scale user manipulation is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings. The attack enables adversarial marketing or political persuasion through targeted message injection.

Conclusion: The research reveals significant security vulnerabilities in LVLMs, calling for better robustness against stealthy multi-turn attacks. The work highlights the feasibility of large-scale user manipulation through visual memory injection and emphasizes the need for improved security measures in vision-language models.

Abstract: Generative large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive performance gains, and their user base is growing rapidly. However, the security of LVLMs, in particular in a long-context multi-turn setting, is largely underexplored. In this paper, we consider the realistic scenario in which an attacker uploads a manipulated image to the web/social media. A benign user downloads this image and uses it as input to the LVLM. Our novel stealthy Visual Memory Injection (VMI) attack is designed such that on normal prompts the LVLM exhibits nominal behavior, but once the user gives a triggering prompt, the LVLM outputs a specific prescribed target message to manipulate the user, e.g. for adversarial marketing or political persuasion. Compared to previous work that focused on single-turn attacks, VMI is effective even after a long multi-turn conversation with the user. We demonstrate our attack on several recent open-weight LVLMs. This article thereby shows that large-scale manipulation of users is feasible with perturbed images in multi-turn conversation settings, calling for better robustness of LVLMs against these attacks.

### [8] [Can Vision-Language Models See Squares? Text-Recognition Mediates Spatial Reasoning Across Three Model Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15950)
*Yuval Levental*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs fail to accurately localize filled cells in binary grids when cells lack textual identity, showing a 34-54 point F1 gap between text symbols and visual squares despite identical visual encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose fundamental limitations in vision-language models' spatial reasoning capabilities, specifically their inability to accurately localize non-textual visual elements in binary grids.

Method: Generated 15x15 binary grids with varying density (10.7%-41.8% filled cells), rendered as two image types: text symbols (. and #) and filled squares without gridlines. Tested three frontier VLMs (Claude Opus, ChatGPT 5.2, Gemini 3 Thinking) on transcription tasks.

Result: Text symbols: Claude/ChatGPT ~91% accuracy, 84% F1; Gemini 84% accuracy, 63% F1. Filled squares: all models collapsed to 60-73% accuracy, 29-39% F1. Distinct failure modes: Claude under-counted, ChatGPT over-counted, Gemini hallucinated templates.

Conclusion: VLMs possess a high-fidelity text-recognition pathway for spatial reasoning that dramatically outperforms their native visual pathway, revealing severe degradation in spatial localization for non-textual visual elements.

Abstract: We present a simple experiment that exposes a fundamental limitation in vision-language models (VLMs): the inability to accurately localize filled cells in binary grids when those cells lack textual identity. We generate fifteen 15x15 grids with varying density (10.7%-41.8% filled cells) and render each as two image types -- text symbols (. and #) and filled squares without gridlines -- then ask three frontier VLMs (Claude Opus, ChatGPT 5.2, and Gemini 3 Thinking) to transcribe them. In the text-symbol condition, Claude and ChatGPT achieve approximately 91% cell accuracy and 84% F1, while Gemini achieves 84% accuracy and 63% F1. In the filled-squares condition, all three models collapse to 60-73% accuracy and 29-39% F1. Critically, all conditions pass through the same visual encoder -- the text symbols are images, not tokenized text. The text-vs-squares F1 gap ranges from 34 to 54 points across models, demonstrating that VLMs behave as if they possess a high-fidelity text-recognition pathway for spatial reasoning that dramatically outperforms their native visual pathway. Each model exhibits a distinct failure mode in the squares condition -- systematic under-counting (Claude), massive over-counting (ChatGPT), and template hallucination (Gemini) -- but all share the same underlying deficit: severely degraded spatial localization for non-textual visual elements.

### [9] [Position-Aware Scene-Appearance Disentanglement for Bidirectional Photoacoustic Microscopy Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15959)
*Yiwen Wang,Jiahao Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPEReg-Net: A scene-appearance disentanglement framework with Global Position Encoding for bidirectional OR-PAM image registration, achieving state-of-the-art performance without explicit deformation field estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bidirectional raster scanning in high-speed OR-PAM doubles imaging speed but introduces coupled domain shift and geometric misalignment between forward/backward scan lines. Existing methods have limitations: registration methods constrained by brightness constancy assumptions achieve limited alignment quality, while generative approaches address domain shift through complex architectures lacking temporal awareness across frames.

Method: Proposes GPEReg-Net with scene-appearance disentanglement framework that separates domain-invariant scene features from domain-specific appearance codes using Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN), enabling direct image-to-image registration without explicit deformation field estimation. Introduces Global Position Encoding (GPE) module combining learnable position embeddings with sinusoidal encoding and cross-frame attention to exploit temporal structure in sequential acquisitions for improved temporal coherence.

Result: On OR-PAM-Reg-4K benchmark (432 test samples), achieves NCC of 0.953, SSIM of 0.932, and PSNR of 34.49dB, surpassing state-of-the-art by 3.8% in SSIM and 1.99dB in PSNR while maintaining competitive NCC.

Conclusion: GPEReg-Net effectively addresses coupled domain shift and geometric misalignment in bidirectional OR-PAM through scene-appearance disentanglement and temporal-aware global position encoding, achieving superior registration performance without complex deformation field estimation.

Abstract: High-speed optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) with bidirectional raster scanning doubles imaging speed but introduces coupled domain shift and geometric misalignment between forward and backward scan lines. Existing registration methods, constrained by brightness constancy assumptions, achieve limited alignment quality, while recent generative approaches address domain shift through complex architectures that lack temporal awareness across frames. We propose GPEReg-Net, a scene-appearance disentanglement framework that separates domain-invariant scene features from domain-specific appearance codes via Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN), enabling direct image-to-image registration without explicit deformation field estimation.

*Phoenix Yu,Tilo Burghardt,Andrew W Dowsey,Neill W Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New detect-segment-identify pipeline using Open-Vocabulary Weight-free Localisation and Segment Anything models achieves 98.93% accuracy for Holstein-Friesian detection in dense groupings, significantly outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cow detection and re-identification methods fail when animals group closely together, especially for species with outline-breaking coat patterns like Holstein-Friesians. Current approaches including YOLO-based detection break down in dense animal groupings common on working farms.

Method: Proposes a detect-segment-identify pipeline combining Open-Vocabulary Weight-free Localisation and Segment Anything models as pre-processing stages alongside Re-ID networks. Uses unsupervised contrastive learning for re-identification.

Result: Achieves 98.93% detection accuracy in dense animal groupings, outperforming oriented bounding box methods by 47.52% and SAM species detection baselines by 27.13%. Re-ID accuracy reaches 94.82% on test data.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline makes re-identification practical and reliable in crowded farm scenarios without manual intervention. The work includes release of 9 days of CCTV farm data and code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Holstein-Friesian detection and re-identification (Re-ID) methods capture individuals well when targets are spatially separate. However, existing approaches, including YOLO-based species detection, break down when cows group closely together. This is particularly prevalent for species which have outline-breaking coat patterns. To boost both effectiveness and transferability in this setting, we propose a new detect-segment-identify pipeline that leverages the Open-Vocabulary Weight-free Localisation and the Segment Anything models as pre-processing stages alongside Re-ID networks. To evaluate our approach, we publish a collection of nine days CCTV data filmed on a working dairy farm. Our methodology overcomes detection breakdown in dense animal groupings, resulting in a 98.93% accuracy. This significantly outperforms current oriented bounding box-driven, as well as SAM species detection baselines with accuracy improvements of 47.52% and 27.13%, respectively. We show that unsupervised contrastive learning can build on this to yield 94.82% Re-ID accuracy on our test data. Our work demonstrates that Re-ID in crowded scenarios is both practical as well as reliable in working farm settings with no manual intervention. Code and dataset are provided for reproducibility.

*Mohamed Khalil Ben Salah,Philippe Jouvet,Rita Noumeir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised pretraining framework using VisionMamba with adaptive masking and teacher-student distillation achieves 42% MAE reduction for contactless heart rate monitoring in pediatric ICU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contact-based sensors in PICUs cause skin irritation, infection risk, and discomfort. Remote photoplethysmography offers contactless heart rate monitoring but faces challenges with motion artifacts, occlusions, lighting variations, and domain shifts between lab and clinical data.

Method: Self-supervised pretraining framework with progressive curriculum strategy using VisionMamba architecture. Features adaptive masking mechanism with Mamba-based controller assigning spatiotemporal importance scores for probabilistic patch sampling. Uses teacher-student distillation with supervised expert model trained on public datasets. Curriculum progresses through three stages: clean public videos, synthetic occlusion scenarios, and unlabeled pediatric patient videos.

Result: Achieves 42% reduction in mean absolute error compared to standard masked autoencoders, outperforms PhysFormer by 31%, with final MAE of 3.2 bpm. Model consistently attends to pulse-rich areas without explicit ROI extraction and shows robustness under clinical occlusions and noise.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised framework effectively addresses domain shift challenges in PICU settings, enabling accurate contactless heart rate monitoring with improved robustness to clinical artifacts and reduced dependency on labeled clinical data.

Abstract: Continuous monitoring of vital signs in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) is essential for early detection of clinical deterioration and effective clinical decision-making. However, contact-based sensors such as pulse oximeters may cause skin irritation, increase infection risk, and lead to patient discomfort. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a contactless alternative to monitor heart rate using facial video, but remains underutilized in PICUs due to motion artifacts, occlusions, variable lighting, and domain shifts between laboratory and clinical data.
  We introduce a self-supervised pretraining framework for rPPG estimation in the PICU setting, based on a progressive curriculum strategy. The approach leverages the VisionMamba architecture and integrates an adaptive masking mechanism, where a lightweight Mamba-based controller assigns spatiotemporal importance scores to guide probabilistic patch sampling. This strategy dynamically increases reconstruction difficulty while preserving physiological relevance.
  To address the lack of labeled clinical data, we adopt a teacher-student distillation setup. A supervised expert model, trained on public datasets, provides latent physiological guidance to the student. The curriculum progresses through three stages: clean public videos, synthetic occlusion scenarios, and unlabeled videos from 500 pediatric patients.
  Our framework achieves a 42% reduction in mean absolute error relative to standard masked autoencoders and outperforms PhysFormer by 31%, reaching a final MAE of 3.2 bpm. Without explicit region-of-interest extraction, the model consistently attends to pulse-rich areas and demonstrates robustness under clinical occlusions and noise.

### [12] [LAND: A Longitudinal Analysis of Neuromorphic Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15973)
*Gregory Cohen,Alexandre Marcireau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This review analyzes 423+ neuromorphic datasets, highlighting issues with dataset accessibility, standardization, and the problematic rise of synthetic datasets while proposing meta-datasets as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the proliferation of neuromorphic datasets, researchers still face difficulties finding, understanding, and using them, compounded by practical accessibility issues and the growing reliance on synthetic data.

Method: The paper conducts a comprehensive review of over 423 existing neuromorphic datasets, analyzing their tasks, data structures, accessibility challenges, and the trend toward synthetic datasets created through simulation or video-to-events methods.

Result: The analysis reveals significant problems: dataset size issues, lack of standardization, practical accessibility difficulties, and concerning growth of synthetic datasets that may create pitfalls for exploring new neuromorphic applications.

Conclusion: The paper proposes meta-datasets created from existing datasets as a solution to reduce the need for more data and eliminate bias from dataset-task definitions, while warning about the risks of synthetic data for novel applications.

Abstract: Neuromorphic engineering has a data problem. Despite the meteoric rise in the number of neuromorphic datasets published over the past ten years, the conclusion of a significant portion of neuromorphic research papers still states that there is a need for yet more data and even larger datasets. Whilst this need is driven in part by the sheer volume of data required by modern deep learning approaches, it is also fuelled by the current state of the available neuromorphic datasets and the difficulties in finding them, understanding their purpose, and determining the nature of their underlying task. This is further compounded by practical difficulties in downloading and using these datasets. This review starts by capturing a snapshot of the existing neuromorphic datasets, covering over 423 datasets, and then explores the nature of their tasks and the underlying structure of the presented data. Analysing these datasets shows the difficulties arising from their size, the lack of standardisation, and difficulties in accessing the actual data. This paper also highlights the growth in the size of individual datasets and the complexities involved in working with the data. However, a more important concern is the rise of synthetic datasets, created by either simulation or video-to-events methods. This review explores the benefits of simulated data for testing existing algorithms and applications, highlighting the potential pitfalls for exploring new applications of neuromorphic technologies. This review also introduces the concepts of meta-datasets, created from existing datasets, as a way of both reducing the need for more data, and to remove potential bias arising from defining both the dataset and the task.

*Xitong Yang,Devansh Kukreja,Don Pinkus,Anushka Sagar,Taosha Fan,Jinhyung Park,Soyong Shin,Jinkun Cao,Jiawei Liu,Nicolas Ugrinovic,Matt Feiszli,Jitendra Malik,Piotr Dollar,Kris Kitani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM 3D Body (3DB) is a promptable model for single-image full-body 3D human mesh recovery that achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalization, using a new parametric mesh representation called Momentum Human Rig (MHR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve 3D human mesh recovery from single images, addressing challenges in generalization across diverse in-the-wild conditions, handling full-body pose including feet and hands, and enabling user-guided inference through prompts.

Method: 3DB uses an encoder-decoder architecture with a novel parametric mesh representation (MHR) that decouples skeletal structure and surface shape. It supports auxiliary prompts (2D keypoints and masks) for user-guided inference. The method employs a multi-stage annotation pipeline combining manual keypoint annotation, differentiable optimization, multi-view geometry, and dense keypoint detection, with an efficient data engine for diverse data collection.

Result: The model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization, substantial improvements over prior methods in both qualitative user preference studies and traditional quantitative analysis. It also introduces a new evaluation dataset organized by pose and appearance categories for nuanced analysis.

Conclusion: SAM 3D Body (3DB) represents a significant advancement in 3D human mesh recovery, offering strong generalization, promptable inference, and consistent accuracy across diverse conditions, with both the model and the new MHR representation being open-source.

Abstract: We introduce SAM 3D Body (3DB), a promptable model for single-image full-body 3D human mesh recovery (HMR) that demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with strong generalization and consistent accuracy in diverse in-the-wild conditions. 3DB estimates the human pose of the body, feet, and hands. It is the first model to use a new parametric mesh representation, Momentum Human Rig (MHR), which decouples skeletal structure and surface shape. 3DB employs an encoder-decoder architecture and supports auxiliary prompts, including 2D keypoints and masks, enabling user-guided inference similar to the SAM family of models. We derive high-quality annotations from a multi-stage annotation pipeline that uses various combinations of manual keypoint annotation, differentiable optimization, multi-view geometry, and dense keypoint detection. Our data engine efficiently selects and processes data to ensure data diversity, collecting unusual poses and rare imaging conditions. We present a new evaluation dataset organized by pose and appearance categories, enabling nuanced analysis of model behavior. Our experiments demonstrate superior generalization and substantial improvements over prior methods in both qualitative user preference studies and traditional quantitative analysis. Both 3DB and MHR are open-source.

*Juampablo E. Heras Rivera,Dickson T. Chen,Tianyi Ren,Daniel K. Low,Asma Ben Abacha,Alberto Santamaria-Pang,Mehmet Kurt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BTReport is an open-source framework for brain tumor radiology report generation that uses deterministic feature extraction followed by LLM-based report composition, producing interpretable reports less prone to hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in neuro-oncology radiology report generation has been limited due to lack of open paired image-report datasets, and existing approaches using vision-language models can produce hallucinated content.

Method: Separates RRG into two steps: 1) deterministic feature extraction from brain tumor images, and 2) using large language models only for syntactic structuring and narrative formatting of extracted features into reports.

Result: Extracted features predict key clinical outcomes (survival, IDH mutation status), and generated reports are more aligned with reference clinical reports than existing baselines. Also introduces BTReport-BraTS dataset with synthetic reports.

Conclusion: BTReport provides an interpretable, less hallucination-prone approach to brain tumor radiology report generation, with clinical relevance and an accompanying open dataset to advance neuro-oncology research.

Abstract: Recent advances in radiology report generation (RRG) have been driven by large paired image-text datasets; however, progress in neuro-oncology has been limited due to a lack of open paired image-report datasets. Here, we introduce BTReport, an open-source framework for brain tumor RRG that constructs natural language radiology reports using deterministically extracted imaging features. Unlike existing approaches that rely on large general-purpose or fine-tuned vision-language models for both image interpretation and report composition, BTReport performs deterministic feature extraction for image analysis and uses large language models only for syntactic structuring and narrative formatting. By separating RRG into a deterministic feature extraction step and a report generation step, the generated reports are completely interpretable and less prone to hallucinations. We show that the features used for report generation are predictive of key clinical outcomes, including survival and IDH mutation status, and reports generated by BTReport are more closely aligned with reference clinical reports than existing baselines for RRG. Finally, we introduce BTReport-BraTS, a companion dataset that augments BraTS imaging with synthetically generated radiology reports produced with BTReport.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedProbCLIP introduces probabilistic vision-language learning for chest X-ray and radiology report representation, modeling uncertainty and many-to-many correspondences to improve reliability in biomedical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language foundation models have deterministic embeddings that lack reliability for high-stakes biomedical applications like radiology, where uncertainty modeling and many-to-many correspondences between images and clinical narratives are crucial.

Method: MedProbCLIP models image and text representations as Gaussian embeddings using probabilistic contrastive learning. It employs variational information bottleneck to prevent overconfidence, multi-view radiograph encoding, and multi-section report encoding during training, while requiring only single inputs at inference.

Result: Outperforms deterministic and probabilistic baselines (CLIP, CXR-CLIP, PCME++) on MIMIC-CXR dataset in retrieval and zero-shot classification. Shows superior calibration, risk-coverage behavior, selective retrieval reliability, and robustness to clinically relevant corruptions.

Conclusion: Probabilistic vision-language modeling improves trustworthiness and safety of radiology image-text retrieval systems by explicitly capturing uncertainty and many-to-many correspondences, making it valuable for high-stakes biomedical applications.

Abstract: Vision-language foundation models have emerged as powerful general-purpose representation learners with strong potential for multimodal understanding, but their deterministic embeddings often fail to provide the reliability required for high-stakes biomedical applications. This work introduces MedProbCLIP, a probabilistic vision-language learning framework for chest X-ray and radiology report representation learning and bidirectional retrieval. MedProbCLIP models image and text representations as Gaussian embeddings through a probabilistic contrastive objective that explicitly captures uncertainty and many-to-many correspondences between radiographs and clinical narratives. A variational information bottleneck mitigates overconfident predictions, while MedProbCLIP employs multi-view radiograph encoding and multi-section report encoding during training to provide fine-grained supervision for clinically aligned correspondence, yet requires only a single radiograph and a single report at inference. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, MedProbCLIP outperforms deterministic and probabilistic baselines, including CLIP, CXR-CLIP, and PCME++, in both retrieval and zero-shot classification. Beyond accuracy, MedProbCLIP demonstrates superior calibration, risk-coverage behavior, selective retrieval reliability, and robustness to clinically relevant corruptions, underscoring the value of probabilistic vision-language modeling for improving the trustworthiness and safety of radiology image-text retrieval systems.

### [16] [LGQ: Learning Discretization Geometry for Scalable and Stable Image Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16086)
*Idil Bilge Altun,Mert Onur Cakiroglu,Elham Buxton,Mehmet Dalkilic,Hasan Kurban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGQ is a new discrete image tokenizer that learns discretization geometry end-to-end using soft assignments, achieving better efficiency and performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing discrete image tokenizers face trade-offs: vector quantization suffers from optimization biases and codebook under-utilization, while structured tokenizers have fixed geometries that inefficiently allocate capacity. There's a need for a tokenizer that learns optimal discretization geometry while maintaining stable training and efficient code usage.

Method: LGQ replaces hard nearest-neighbor lookup with temperature-controlled soft assignments, enabling fully differentiable training. It uses posterior responsibilities of an isotropic Gaussian mixture and minimizes a variational free-energy objective. The method includes token-level peakedness regularization and global usage regularization to encourage confident yet balanced code utilization without rigid grids.

Result: LGQ achieves stable optimization and balanced utilization across multiple vocabulary sizes. At 16K codebook size, it improves rFID by 11.88% over FSQ while using 49.96% fewer active codes, and improves rFID by 6.06% over SimVQ with 49.45% lower effective representation rate.

Conclusion: LGQ successfully addresses the limitations of existing tokenizers by learning discretization geometry end-to-end, achieving better performance with more efficient code utilization, making it a promising approach for scalable visual generation.

Abstract: Discrete image tokenization is a key bottleneck for scalable visual generation: a tokenizer must remain compact for efficient latent-space priors while preserving semantic structure and using discrete capacity effectively. Existing quantizers face a trade-off: vector-quantized tokenizers learn flexible geometries but often suffer from biased straight-through optimization, codebook under-utilization, and representation collapse at large vocabularies. Structured scalar or implicit tokenizers ensure stable, near-complete utilization by design, yet rely on fixed discretization geometries that may allocate capacity inefficiently under heterogeneous latent statistics.
  We introduce Learnable Geometric Quantization (LGQ), a discrete image tokenizer that learns discretization geometry end-to-end. LGQ replaces hard nearest-neighbor lookup with temperature-controlled soft assignments, enabling fully differentiable training while recovering hard assignments at inference. The assignments correspond to posterior responsibilities of an isotropic Gaussian mixture and minimize a variational free-energy objective, provably converging to nearest-neighbor quantization in the low-temperature limit. LGQ combines a token-level peakedness regularizer with a global usage regularizer to encourage confident yet balanced code utilization without imposing rigid grids.
  Under a controlled VQGAN-style backbone on ImageNet across multiple vocabulary sizes, LGQ achieves stable optimization and balanced utilization. At 16K codebook size, LGQ improves rFID by 11.88% over FSQ while using 49.96% fewer active codes, and improves rFID by 6.06% over SimVQ with 49.45% lower effective representation rate, achieving comparable fidelity with substantially fewer active entries.

### [17] [OmniCT: Towards a Unified Slice-Volume LVLM for Comprehensive CT Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16110)
*Tianwei Lin,Zhongwei Qiu,Wenqiao Zhang,Jiang Liu,Yihan Xie,Mingjian Gao,Zhenxuan Fan,Zhaocheng Li,Sijing Li,Zhongle Xie,Peng LU,Yueting Zhuang,Yingda Xia,Ling Zhang,Beng Chin Ooi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniCT is a unified slice-volume Large Vision-Language Model for CT imaging that bridges the gap between slice-level detail and volumetric spatial reasoning through spatial consistency enhancement and organ-level semantic enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs for CT are fragmented - slice-driven models lack cross-slice spatial consistency, while volume-driven models have coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. This fragmentation hinders clinical translation of medical LVLMs.

Method: Three key contributions: 1) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE) with volumetric slice composition and tri-axial positional embedding for volumetric consistency, plus MoE hybrid projection for efficient slice-volume adaptation; 2) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE) using segmentation and ROI localization to align anatomical regions; 3) MedEval-CT dataset and benchmark for unified evaluation.

Result: OmniCT consistently outperforms existing methods by substantial margins across diverse clinical tasks, satisfying both micro-level detail sensitivity and macro-level spatial reasoning requirements.

Conclusion: OmniCT establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal medical imaging understanding by unifying slice and volume representations in CT analysis, addressing a major bottleneck in clinical translation of medical LVLMs.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used and diagnostically information-dense imaging modalities, covering critical organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, and colon. Clinical interpretation relies on both slice-driven local features (e.g., sub-centimeter nodules, lesion boundaries) and volume-driven spatial representations (e.g., tumor infiltration, inter-organ anatomical relations). However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain fragmented in CT slice versus volumetric understanding: slice-driven LVLMs show strong generalization but lack cross-slice spatial consistency, while volume-driven LVLMs explicitly capture volumetric semantics but suffer from coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. The absence of a unified modeling paradigm constitutes a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of medical LVLMs. We present OmniCT, a powerful unified slice-volume LVLM for CT scenarios, which makes three contributions: (i) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE): volumetric slice composition combined with tri-axial positional embedding that introduces volumetric consistency, and an MoE hybrid projection enables efficient slice-volume adaptation; (ii) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE): segmentation and ROI localization explicitly align anatomical regions, emphasizing lesion- and organ-level semantics; (iii) MedEval-CT: the largest slice-volume CT dataset and hybrid benchmark integrates comprehensive metrics for unified evaluation. OmniCT consistently outperforms existing methods with a substantial margin across diverse clinical tasks and satisfies both micro-level detail sensitivity and macro-level spatial reasoning. More importantly, it establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal medical imaging understanding.

*Joel Mathew Cherian,Ashutosh Muralidhara Bharadwaj,Vima Gupta,Anand Padmanabha Iyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHAI introduces cross-inference caching with Cache Attention to speed up text-to-video diffusion models by reusing cached latents across semantically related prompts, achieving 1.65x-3.35x speedup over OpenSora 1.2 with only 8 denoising steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video diffusion models are slow due to sequential denoising of 3D latents. Existing speed-up methods either require expensive retraining or use heuristic step skipping that degrades video quality when reducing denoising steps.

Method: CHAI uses cross-inference caching with Cache Attention, a selective attention mechanism that attends to shared objects/scenes across cross-inference latents. This enables effective reuse of cached latents across semantically related prompts for high cache hit rates.

Result: CHAI can generate high-quality videos with as few as 8 denoising steps. When integrated into the overall system, it achieves 1.65x - 3.35x faster inference than baseline OpenSora 1.2 while maintaining video quality.

Conclusion: Cross-inference caching with Cache Attention provides an effective approach to accelerate text-to-video diffusion models without expensive retraining or quality degradation, enabling faster video generation while preserving output quality.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models deliver impressive results but remain slow because of the sequential denoising of 3D latents. Existing approaches to speed up inference either require expensive model retraining or use heuristic-based step skipping, which struggles to maintain video quality as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our work, CHAI, aims to use cross-inference caching to reduce latency while maintaining video quality. We introduce Cache Attention as an effective method for attending to shared objects/scenes across cross-inference latents. This selective attention mechanism enables effective reuse of cached latents across semantically related prompts, yielding high cache hit rates. We show that it is possible to generate high-quality videos using Cache Attention with as few as 8 denoising steps. When integrated into the overall system, CHAI is 1.65x - 3.35x faster than baseline OpenSora 1.2 while maintaining video quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRIS uses real-time eye-tracking data to resolve ambiguity in visual question answering, improving accuracy on ambiguous questions from 35.2% to 77.2% while maintaining performance on unambiguous queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual question answering systems struggle with ambiguous queries where multiple interpretations are possible. The paper aims to leverage human eye-tracking data to disambiguate user intent in real-time during question asking.

Method: IRIS (Intent Resolution via Inference-time Saccades) is a training-free approach that uses real-time eye-tracking data, specifically fixations closest to when participants start verbally asking questions, to resolve ambiguity in open-ended VQA.

Result: The approach more than doubles accuracy on ambiguous questions (from 35.2% to 77.2%) while maintaining performance on unambiguous queries. It shows consistent improvements across state-of-the-art VLMs regardless of architectural differences.

Conclusion: Eye-tracking data, particularly fixations during question initiation, provides valuable disambiguation signals for VQA. The paper releases a new benchmark dataset, real-time interactive protocol, and evaluation suite for gaze-based VQA disambiguation.

Abstract: We introduce IRIS (Intent Resolution via Inference-time Saccades), a novel training-free approach that uses eye-tracking data in real-time to resolve ambiguity in open-ended VQA. Through a comprehensive user study with 500 unique image-question pairs, we demonstrate that fixations closest to the time participants start verbally asking their questions are the most informative for disambiguation in Large VLMs, more than doubling the accuracy of responses on ambiguous questions (from 35.2% to 77.2%) while maintaining performance on unambiguous queries. We evaluate our approach across state-of-the-art VLMs, showing consistent improvements when gaze data is incorporated in ambiguous image-question pairs, regardless of architectural differences. We release a new benchmark dataset to use eye movement data for disambiguated VQA, a novel real-time interactive protocol, and an evaluation suite.

*Huichan Seo,Minki Hong,Sieun Choi,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines demographic bias in instruction-guided image-to-image editing, identifying two failure modes (Soft Erasure and Stereotype Replacement) and showing that identity preservation failures are pervasive and demographically uneven.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While demographic bias in text-to-image generation is well studied, demographic-conditioned failures in instruction-guided image-to-image editing remain underexplored. The research aims to investigate whether identical edit instructions yield systematically different outcomes across subject demographics in open-weight I2I editors.

Method: The authors formalize two failure modes (Soft Erasure and Stereotype Replacement), create a controlled benchmark to probe demographic-conditioned behavior by generating and editing portraits conditioned on race, gender, and age using diagnostic prompts, and evaluate multiple editors with vision-language model scoring and human evaluation.

Result: The analysis shows that identity preservation failures are pervasive, demographically uneven, and shaped by implicit social priors (including occupation-driven gender inference). The study also demonstrates that a prompt-level identity constraint, without model updates, can substantially reduce demographic change for minority groups while leaving majority-group portraits largely unchanged, revealing asymmetric identity priors.

Conclusion: The findings establish identity preservation as a central and demographically uneven failure mode in I2I editing and motivate the development of demographic-robust editing systems.

Abstract: Demographic bias in text-to-image (T2I) generation is well studied, yet demographic-conditioned failures in instruction-guided image-to-image (I2I) editing remain underexplored. We examine whether identical edit instructions yield systematically different outcomes across subject demographics in open-weight I2I editors. We formalize two failure modes: Soft Erasure, where edits are silently weakened or ignored in the output image, and Stereotype Replacement, where edits introduce unrequested, stereotype-consistent attributes. We introduce a controlled benchmark that probes demographic-conditioned behavior by generating and editing portraits conditioned on race, gender, and age using a diagnostic prompt set, and evaluate multiple editors with vision-language model (VLM) scoring and human evaluation. Our analysis shows that identity preservation failures are pervasive, demographically uneven, and shaped by implicit social priors, including occupation-driven gender inference. Finally, we demonstrate that a prompt-level identity constraint, without model updates, can substantially reduce demographic change for minority groups while leaving majority-group portraits largely unchanged, revealing asymmetric identity priors in current editors. Together, our findings establish identity preservation as a central and demographically uneven failure mode in I2I editing and motivate demographic-robust editing systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UncL-STARK enables dynamic depth adaptation in transformer trackers using uncertainty-aware truncation, reducing computation by up to 12% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based trackers use fixed-depth inference for all frames, incurring unnecessary computational costs in temporally coherent video sequences where many frames don't require full processing.

Method: Fine-tune model with random-depth training and knowledge distillation to work at multiple depths. Use lightweight uncertainty estimates from corner heatmaps to select encoder/decoder depth per frame via feedback policy that exploits temporal coherence.

Result: Achieves up to 12% GFLOPs reduction, 8.9% latency reduction, and 10.8% energy savings while maintaining tracking accuracy within 0.2% of full-depth baseline on GOT-10k and LaSOT datasets.

Conclusion: UncL-STARK enables efficient transformer tracking through dynamic depth adaptation without modifying architecture, significantly reducing computational costs while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: Transformer-based single-object trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy but rely on fixed-depth inference, executing the full encoder--decoder stack for every frame regardless of visual complexity, thereby incurring unnecessary computational cost in long video sequences dominated by temporally coherent frames. We propose UncL-STARK, an architecture-preserving approach that enables dynamic, uncertainty-aware depth adaptation in transformer-based trackers without modifying the underlying network or adding auxiliary heads. The model is fine-tuned to retain predictive robustness at multiple intermediate depths using random-depth training with knowledge distillation, thus enabling safe inference-time truncation. At runtime, we derive a lightweight uncertainty estimate directly from the model's corner localization heatmaps and use it in a feedback-driven policy that selects the encoder and decoder depth for the next frame based on the prediction confidence by exploiting temporal coherence in video. Extensive experiments on GOT-10k and LaSOT demonstrate up to 12\% GFLOPs reduction, 8.9\% latency reduction, and 10.8\% energy savings while maintaining tracking accuracy within 0.2\% of the full-depth baseline across both short-term and long-term sequences.

TL;DR: EasyControlEdge adapts image-generation foundation models for edge detection, achieving crisp edges and data efficiency through edge-specialized adaptation and unconditional dynamics guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world edge detection applications (floor-plan walls, satellite roads/buildings, medical organ boundaries) require crisp edge maps and data efficiency, but current methods struggle with producing crisp raw edges with limited training samples. Image-generation foundation models have strong priors for data-efficient transfer and iterative refinement for detail preservation, but these capabilities are underexploited for edge detection.

Method: 1) Edge-specialized adaptation of image-generation foundation models with edge-oriented objective and efficient pixel-space loss. 2) Inference-time guidance based on unconditional dynamics, enabling single model to control edge density through guidance scale.

Result: Experiments on BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, and CubiCasa show consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods, particularly under no-post-processing crispness evaluation and with limited training data.

Conclusion: EasyControlEdge successfully leverages image-generation foundation models' capabilities for crisp and data-efficient edge detection, demonstrating the value of adapting these models for specialized edge detection tasks.

Abstract: We propose EasyControlEdge, adapting an image-generation foundation model to edge detection. In real-world edge detection (e.g., floor-plan walls, satellite roads/buildings, and medical organ boundaries), crispness and data efficiency are crucial, yet producing crisp raw edge maps with limited training samples remains challenging. Although image-generation foundation models perform well on many downstream tasks, their pretrained priors for data-efficient transfer and iterative refinement for high-frequency detail preservation remain underexploited for edge detection. To enable crisp and data-efficient edge detection using these capabilities, we introduce an edge-specialized adaptation of image-generation foundation models. To better specialize the foundation model for edge detection, we incorporate an edge-oriented objective with an efficient pixel-space loss. At inference, we introduce guidance based on unconditional dynamics, enabling a single model to control the edge density through a guidance scale. Experiments on BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, and CubiCasa compare against state-of-the-art methods and show consistent gains, particularly under no-post-processing crispness evaluation and with limited training data.

TL;DR: HyPCA-Net is a novel multimodal fusion network for medical imaging that improves performance by 5.2% while reducing computational cost by 73.1% through efficient attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fusion methods for medical imaging (MRI, CT, etc.) face two key limitations: 1) computationally expensive models that limit low-resource deployment, and 2) cascaded attention modules that risk information loss and hinder robust shared representation learning across modalities, restricting generalization in multi-disease analysis.

Method: HyPCA-Net (Hybrid Parallel-Fusion Cascaded Attention Network) introduces two novel blocks: 1) a computationally efficient residual adaptive learning attention block for refined modality-specific representations, and 2) a dual-view cascaded attention block for learning robust shared representations across diverse modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on ten publicly available datasets show HyPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing leading methods with up to 5.2% performance improvement and up to 73.1% reduction in computational cost.

Conclusion: HyPCA-Net effectively addresses computational efficiency and representation learning challenges in multimodal medical imaging fusion, offering superior performance with significantly reduced computational requirements for applications like skin cancer detection, dementia diagnosis, and brain tumor prediction.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion frameworks, which integrate diverse medical imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT), have shown great potential in applications such as skin cancer detection, dementia diagnosis, and brain tumor prediction. However, existing multimodal fusion methods face significant challenges. First, they often rely on computationally expensive models, limiting their applicability in low-resource environments. Second, they often employ cascaded attention modules, which potentially increase risk of information loss during inter-module transitions and hinder their capacity to effectively capture robust shared representations across modalities. This restricts their generalization in multi-disease analysis tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hybrid Parallel-Fusion Cascaded Attention Network (HyPCA-Net), composed of two core novel blocks: (a) a computationally efficient residual adaptive learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific representations, and (b) a dual-view cascaded attention block aimed at learning robust shared representations across diverse modalities. Extensive experiments on ten publicly available datasets exhibit that HyPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing leading methods, with improvements of up to 5.2% in performance and reductions of up to 73.1% in computational cost.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution self-supervised pretraining typically requires server-scale infrastructure, limiting foundation model development for many research labs. Existing MAE approaches struggle with hierarchical architectures due to dense grid priors and mask-aware design compromises.

Method: AFFMAE discards masked tokens and performs dynamic merging exclusively over visible tokens, removing dense-grid assumptions while preserving hierarchical scalability. Uses numerically stable mixed-precision Flash-style cluster attention kernels and mitigates representation collapse via deep supervision.

Result: On high-resolution electron microscopy segmentation, AFFMAE matches ViT-MAE performance at equal parameter count while reducing FLOPs by up to 7x, halving memory usage, and achieving faster training on a single RTX 5090.

Conclusion: AFFMAE enables efficient hierarchical pretraining for high-resolution tasks on limited hardware, making foundation model development more accessible to research labs without server-scale infrastructure.

Abstract: Self-supervised pretraining has transformed computer vision by enabling data-efficient fine-tuning, yet high-resolution training typically requires server-scale infrastructure, limiting in-domain foundation model development for many research laboratories. Masked Autoencoders (MAE) reduce computation by encoding only visible tokens, but combining MAE with hierarchical downsampling architectures remains structurally challenging due to dense grid priors and mask-aware design compromises. We introduce AFFMAE, a masking-friendly hierarchical pretraining framework built on adaptive, off-grid token merging. By discarding masked tokens and performing dynamic merging exclusively over visible tokens, AFFMAE removes dense-grid assumptions while preserving hierarchical scalability. We developed numerically stable mixed-precision Flash-style cluster attention kernels, and mitigate sparse-stage representation collapse via deep supervision. On high-resolution electron microscopy segmentation, AFFMAE matches ViT-MAE performance at equal parameter count while reducing FLOPs by up to 7x, halving memory usage, and achieving faster training on a single RTX 5090.

TL;DR: A computer vision system replaces mechanical eyeframe tracers using multi-view RGB-D processing for precise lens measurements without specialized equipment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mechanical frame tracers are time-consuming, require precise calibration and additional equipment, creating inefficient workflows for opticians who need sub-millimeter precision for proper lens fitting.

Method: Uses multi-view artificial vision with an InVision system: image acquisition → frame segmentation → depth estimation → multi-view processing integrating segmented RGB images with depth data for precise contour measurement.

Result: Competitive measurements from still color images compared to other solutions, eliminating need for specialized tracing equipment and reducing workflow complexity for optical technicians.

Conclusion: The proposed computer vision approach provides an efficient alternative to traditional mechanical eyeframe tracing, achieving required precision while simplifying the optical workflow.

Abstract: Eyeframe lens tracing is an important process in the optical industry that requires sub-millimeter precision to ensure proper lens fitting and optimal vision correction. Traditional frame tracers rely on mechanical tools that need precise positioning and calibration, which are time-consuming and require additional equipment, creating an inefficient workflow for opticians. This work presents a novel approach based on artificial vision that utilizes multi-view information. The proposed algorithm operates on images captured from an InVision system. The full pipeline includes image acquisition, frame segmentation to isolate the eyeframe from background, depth estimation to obtain 3D spatial information, and multi-view processing that integrates segmented RGB images with depth data for precise frame contour measurement. To this end, different configurations and variants are proposed and analyzed on real data, providing competitive measurements from still color images with respect to other solutions, while eliminating the need for specialized tracing equipment and reducing workflow complexity for optical technicians.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning improves feature extractors for object detection, reducing need for labeled data while outperforming ImageNet-pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeled data for training deep learning models is scarce and expensive, especially for complex tasks like object detection. Companies face high costs for data labeling through skilled personnel or outsourcing.

Method: Uses self-supervised learning strategy to train feature extractors on unlabeled data, enhancing model's ability to learn effective representations without extensive labeled datasets.

Result: The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art feature extractors pre-trained on ImageNet for object detection tasks. It focuses on the most relevant object aspects, achieving better feature representations with improved reliability and robustness.

Conclusion: Enhancing feature extractors through self-supervised learning significantly reduces dependency on labeled data while improving performance, offering a cost-effective solution for object detection applications.

Abstract: In the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence, where models are increasingly growing in complexity and size, the availability of labeled data for training deep learning models has become a significant challenge. Addressing complex problems like object detection demands considerable time and resources for data labeling to achieve meaningful results. For companies developing such applications, this entails extensive investment in highly skilled personnel or costly outsourcing. This research work aims to demonstrate that enhancing feature extractors can substantially alleviate this challenge, enabling models to learn more effective representations with less labeled data. Utilizing a self-supervised learning strategy, we present a model trained on unlabeled data that outperforms state-of-the-art feature extractors pre-trained on ImageNet and particularly designed for object detection tasks. Moreover, the results demonstrate that our approach encourages the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of an object, thus achieving better feature representations and, therefore, reinforcing its reliability and robustness.

### [29] [SCAR: Satellite Imagery-Based Calibration for Aerial Recordings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16349)
*Henry Hölzemann,Michael Schleiss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCAR is a method for long-term auto-calibration refinement of aerial visual-inertial systems using satellite imagery as a global reference, outperforming existing baselines without manual intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing aerial calibration methods require dedicated calibration maneuvers or manually surveyed ground control points, which are impractical for long-term field deployment. There's a need for automated calibration that can correct degradation over time without manual intervention.

Method: SCAR estimates both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters by aligning aerial images with 2D-3D correspondences derived from publicly available orthophotos and elevation models. It uses georeferenced satellite imagery as a persistent global reference for calibration refinement.

Result: SCAR consistently outperformed established baselines (Kalibr, COLMAP, VINS-Mono) across six large-scale aerial campaigns over two years. It reduced median reprojection error by a large margin and achieved substantially lower visual localization rotation errors and higher pose accuracy.

Conclusion: SCAR provides accurate, robust, and reproducible calibration over long-term aerial operations without manual intervention, demonstrating practical viability for real-world deployment under diverse seasonal and environmental conditions.

Abstract: We introduce SCAR, a method for long-term auto-calibration refinement of aerial visual-inertial systems that exploits georeferenced satellite imagery as a persistent global reference. SCAR estimates both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters by aligning aerial images with 2D--3D correspondences derived from publicly available orthophotos and elevation models. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on dedicated calibration maneuvers or manually surveyed ground control points, our method leverages external geospatial data to detect and correct calibration degradation under field deployment conditions. We evaluate our approach on six large-scale aerial campaigns conducted over two years under diverse seasonal and environmental conditions. Across all sequences, SCAR consistently outperforms established baselines (Kalibr, COLMAP, VINS-Mono), reducing median reprojection error by a large margin, and translating these calibration gains into substantially lower visual localization rotation errors and higher pose accuracy. These results demonstrate that SCAR provides accurate, robust, and reproducible calibration over long-term aerial operations without the need for manual intervention.

*Qi He,XiangXiang Wang,Jingtao Zhang,Yongbin Yu,Hongxiang Chu,Manping Fan,JingYe Cai,Zhenglin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMAA improves monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion for visually impaired users by addressing projection diffusion and feature entanglement through adaptive multi-scale attention aggregation, achieving better performance without significantly increasing complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular SSC approaches lack explicit modeling of voxel-feature reliability and regulated cross-scale information propagation during 2D-3D projection and multi-scale fusion, making them vulnerable to projection diffusion and feature entanglement, which limits structural stability for safety-critical scene understanding in assistive systems for visually impaired users.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Multi-scale Attention Aggregation (AMAA) framework built upon MonoScene pipeline. Features joint calibration of lifted voxel features in semantic and spatial dimensions through parallel channel-spatial attention aggregation, and stabilizes multi-scale encoder-decoder fusion via hierarchical adaptive feature-gating strategy that regulates information injection across scales.

Result: On NYUv2 benchmark: 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31 improvement) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59 improvement). System-level deployment on NVIDIA Jetson platform verifies stable execution on embedded hardware without significantly increasing system complexity.

Conclusion: AMAA improves monocular SSC quality and provides a reliable and deployable perception framework for indoor assistive systems targeting visually impaired users, addressing key limitations of existing approaches while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for embedded deployment.

Abstract: In indoor assistive perception for visually impaired users, 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is expected to provide structurally coherent and semantically consistent occupancy under strictly monocular vision for safety-critical scene understanding. However, existing monocular SSC approaches often lack explicit modeling of voxel-feature reliability and regulated cross-scale information propagation during 2D-3D projection and multi-scale fusion, making them vulnerable to projection diffusion and feature entanglement and thus limiting structural stability.To address these challenges, this paper presents an Adaptive Multi-scale Attention Aggregation (AMAA) framework built upon the MonoScene pipeline. Rather than introducing a heavier backbone, AMAA focuses on reliability-oriented feature regulation within a monocular SSC framework. Specifically, lifted voxel features are jointly calibrated in semantic and spatial dimensions through parallel channel-spatial attention aggregation, while multi-scale encoder-decoder fusion is stabilized via a hierarchical adaptive feature-gating strategy that regulates information injection across scales.Experiments on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements over MonoScene without significantly increasing system complexity: AMAA achieves 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59). In addition, system-level deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson platform verifies that the complete AMAA framework can be executed stably on embedded hardware. Overall, AMAA improves monocular SSC quality and provides a reliable and deployable perception framework for indoor assistive systems targeting visually impaired users.

### [31] [ReMoRa: Multimodal Large Language Model based on Refined Motion Representation for Long-Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16412)
*Daichi Yashima,Shuhei Kurita,Yusuke Oda,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMoRa is a video MLLM that processes compressed video representations instead of sequential RGB frames, using sparse keyframes for appearance and motion representations for temporal dynamics, achieving linear scaling with sequence length and superior performance on long-video benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form video understanding remains challenging for MLLMs due to computational intractability of processing full RGB frame streams and quadratic complexity of self-attention with sequence length. Existing approaches struggle with redundancy in sequential frames.

Method: ReMoRa operates directly on compressed video representations: retains sparse RGB keyframes for appearance, encodes temporal dynamics as motion representations (compact proxy for optical flow), introduces denoising module to refine block-based motions, and compresses features with linear scaling to sequence length.

Result: ReMoRa outperforms baseline methods on multiple challenging long-video benchmarks including LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU, demonstrating effectiveness in long-form video understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Processing videos through compressed representations (sparse keyframes + motion features) rather than sequential RGB frames enables efficient long-video understanding in MLLMs with linear computational scaling, addressing the computational challenges of traditional approaches.

Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, long-form video understanding remains a significant challenge. In this study, we focus on video understanding by MLLMs. This task is challenging because processing a full stream of RGB frames is computationally intractable and highly redundant, as self-attention have quadratic complexity with sequence length. In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation. Furthermore, our model compresses these features in a way that scales linearly with sequence length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReMoRa through extensive experiments across a comprehensive suite of long-video understanding benchmarks. ReMoRa outperformed baseline methods on multiple challenging benchmarks, including LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU.

*Ali Faraz,Raja Kolla,Ashish Kulkarni,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents two OCR training strategies for multilingual Indian documents: end-to-end vision-language model training vs. fine-tuning existing OCR models, finding the latter offers better accuracy-latency trade-offs. It introduces Chitrapathak-2 (3-6x faster than predecessor) and Parichay (specialized for Indian government documents).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: India's OCR needs require balancing linguistic diversity, document heterogeneity, and deployment constraints. Building effective OCR systems for Indian languages faces challenges due to multiple languages and varied document types.

Method: Two strategies: 1) End-to-end training of vision encoder with multilingual language model, 2) Fine-tuning existing OCR models not originally trained for target languages. Evaluation on multilingual Indic OCR benchmarks with deployment metrics.

Result: Fine-tuning strategy consistently achieves better accuracy-latency trade-offs. Chitrapathak-2 achieves 3-6x speedup over predecessor, SOTA in Telugu (6.69 char ANLS), second best in other languages. Parichay achieves 89.8% Exact Match for 9 Indian government documents with faster inference.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning existing OCR models is more effective than end-to-end training for Indian multilingual OCR. The presented systems achieve SOTA performance and provide practical guidance for production-scale OCR pipelines in India.

Abstract: Designing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems for India requires balancing linguistic diversity, document heterogeneity, and deployment constraints. In this paper, we study two training strategies for building multilingual OCR systems with Vision-Language Models through the Chitrapathak series. We first follow a popular multimodal approach, pairing a generic vision encoder with a strong multilingual language model and training the system end-to-end for OCR. Alternatively, we explore fine-tuning an existing OCR model, despite not being trained for the target languages. Through extensive evaluation on multilingual Indic OCR benchmarks and deployment-oriented metrics, we find that the second strategy consistently achieves better accuracy-latency trade-offs. Chitrapathak-2 achieves 3-6x speedup over its predecessor with being state-of-the-art (SOTA) in Telugu (6.69 char ANLS) and second best in the rest. In addition, we present Parichay, an independent OCR model series designed specifically for 9 Indian government documents to extract structured key fields, achieving 89.8% Exact Match score with a faster inference. Together, these systems achieve SOTA performance and provide practical guidance for building production-scale OCR pipelines in the Indian context.

### [33] [Visual Self-Refine: A Pixel-Guided Paradigm for Accurate Chart Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16455)
*Jinsong Li,Xiaoyi Dong,Yuhang Zang,Yuhang Cao,Jiaqi Wang,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Visual Self-Refine (VSR) paradigm for chart parsing, enabling models to generate pixel-level localizations as visual anchors for self-correction, addressing visual perception errors in dense charts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs struggle with visually dense charts, leading to errors like data omission, misalignment, and hallucination. Human strategy of using visual anchors (like fingers) for accuracy inspired the need for models to similarly inspect and correct their own visual perception errors.

Method: Proposes VSR paradigm where models generate pixel-level localization outputs, visualize them, and feed these visualizations back for self-inspection. Instantiates as ChartVSR with two stages: Refine Stage (iterative visual feedback for accurate pixel-level localizations) and Decode Stage (using verified localizations as visual anchors to parse structured data). Also constructs ChartP-Bench benchmark.

Result: Introduces ChartVSR model and ChartP-Bench benchmark. Demonstrates VSR as a general-purpose visual feedback mechanism for enhancing accuracy on vision-centric tasks, though specific quantitative results not provided in abstract.

Conclusion: VSR offers a promising new direction for improving accuracy in complex visual perception tasks like chart parsing by enabling models to use visual feedback for self-correction, similar to human visual anchoring strategies.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for reasoning and self-correction at the textual level, these strengths provide minimal benefits for complex tasks centered on visual perception, such as Chart Parsing. Existing models often struggle with visually dense charts, leading to errors like data omission, misalignment, and hallucination. Inspired by the human strategy of using a finger as a ``visual anchor'' to ensure accuracy when reading complex charts, we propose a new paradigm named Visual Self-Refine (VSR). The core idea of VSR is to enable a model to generate pixel-level localization outputs, visualize them, and then feed these visualizations back to itself, allowing it to intuitively inspect and correct its own potential visual perception errors. We instantiate the VSR paradigm in the domain of Chart Parsing by proposing ChartVSR. This model decomposes the parsing process into two stages: a Refine Stage, where it iteratively uses visual feedback to ensure the accuracy of all data points' Pixel-level Localizations, and a Decode Stage, where it uses these verified localizations as precise visual anchors to parse the final structured data. To address the limitations of existing benchmarks, we also construct ChartP-Bench, a new and highly challenging benchmark for chart parsing. Our work also highlights VSR as a general-purpose visual feedback mechanism, offering a promising new direction for enhancing accuracy on a wide range of vision-centric tasks.

*Yihao Lu,Wanru Cheng,Zeyu Zhang,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMA is a multimodal memory agent that dynamically scores memory reliability using source credibility, temporal decay, and conflict consensus to reduce overconfident errors, with a new benchmark revealing visual biases in RAG agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Similarity-based retrieval in multimodal agents often surfaces stale, low-credibility, or conflicting memory items, leading to overconfident errors. Current approaches lack mechanisms to assess and weight the reliability of retrieved multimodal evidence.

Method: Proposes Multimodal Memory Agent (MMA) with dynamic reliability scoring combining source credibility, temporal decay, and conflict-aware network consensus. Uses this signal to reweight evidence and abstain when support is insufficient. Also introduces MMA-Bench, a programmatically generated benchmark for belief dynamics with controlled speaker reliability and structured text-vision contradictions.

Result: On FEVER: matches baseline accuracy while reducing variance by 35.2% and improving selective utility. On LoCoMo: safety-oriented configuration improves actionable accuracy and reduces wrong answers. On MMA-Bench: MMA reaches 41.18% Type-B accuracy in Vision mode, while baseline collapses to 0.0%. Uncovers "Visual Placebo Effect" showing RAG agents inherit latent visual biases from foundation models.

Conclusion: MMA effectively addresses reliability issues in multimodal memory retrieval through dynamic scoring mechanisms, demonstrating improved performance and reduced errors across multiple benchmarks while revealing important biases in current multimodal systems.

Abstract: Long-horizon multimodal agents depend on external memory; however, similarity-based retrieval often surfaces stale, low-credibility, or conflicting items, which can trigger overconfident errors. We propose Multimodal Memory Agent (MMA), which assigns each retrieved memory item a dynamic reliability score by combining source credibility, temporal decay, and conflict-aware network consensus, and uses this signal to reweight evidence and abstain when support is insufficient. We also introduce MMA-Bench, a programmatically generated benchmark for belief dynamics with controlled speaker reliability and structured text-vision contradictions. Using this framework, we uncover the "Visual Placebo Effect", revealing how RAG-based agents inherit latent visual biases from foundation models. On FEVER, MMA matches baseline accuracy while reducing variance by 35.2% and improving selective utility; on LoCoMo, a safety-oriented configuration improves actionable accuracy and reduces wrong answers; on MMA-Bench, MMA reaches 41.18% Type-B accuracy in Vision mode, while the baseline collapses to 0.0% under the same protocol.

*Alexis Winter,Jean-Vincent Martini,Romaric Audigier,Angelique Loesch,Bertrand Luvison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified benchmark for evaluating adversarial attacks on object detection models, addressing the lack of standardized evaluation in this field. It investigates attack transferability across architectures and identifies optimal adversarial training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but defense progress lags behind classification due to inconsistent evaluation standards. There's a need for fair benchmarks to compare attacks, understand transferability across architectures, and identify effective defense strategies.

Method: Proposes a unified benchmark framework for digital, non-patch-based attacks with specific metrics to separate localization and classification errors. Uses multiple perceptual metrics to evaluate attack cost. Conducts extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks across various detectors.

Result: Two key findings: 1) Modern adversarial attacks show poor transferability to transformer-based architectures compared to CNN-based detectors. 2) The most robust adversarial training uses a mixed dataset of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (spatial and semantic), outperforming single-attack training.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a standardized evaluation framework for object detection adversarial attacks, reveals architectural transferability limitations, and identifies optimal defense strategies through mixed-attack adversarial training.

Abstract: Object detection models are critical components of automated systems, such as autonomous vehicles and perception-based robots, but their sensitivity to adversarial attacks poses a serious security risk. Progress in defending these models lags behind classification, hindered by a lack of standardized evaluation. It is nearly impossible to thoroughly compare attack or defense methods, as existing work uses different datasets, inconsistent efficiency metrics, and varied measures of perturbation cost. This paper addresses this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) How can we create a fair benchmark to impartially compare attacks? (2) How well do modern attacks transfer across different architectures, especially from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers? (3) What is the most effective adversarial training strategy for robust defense? To answer these, we first propose a unified benchmark framework focused on digital, non-patch-based attacks. This framework introduces specific metrics to disentangle localization and classification errors and evaluates attack cost using multiple perceptual metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks and a wide range of detectors. Our findings reveal two major conclusions: first, modern adversarial attacks against object detection models show a significant lack of transferability to transformer-based architectures. Second, we demonstrate that the most robust adversarial training strategy leverages a dataset composed of a mix of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (e.g., spatial and semantic), which outperforms training on any single attack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing garment pattern generation methods have limitations: feed-forward approaches struggle with diverse poses and viewpoints, while optimization-based methods are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. There's a need for editable, separable, and simulation-ready garments for modeling and fabrication applications.

Method: Proposes DressWild pipeline that: 1) Uses vision-language models (VLMs) to normalize pose variations at image level, 2) Extracts pose-aware, 3D-informed garment features, 3) Fuses features through transformer-based encoder, 4) Predicts sewing pattern parameters directly applicable to physical simulation, texture synthesis, and multi-layer virtual try-on.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate robust recovery of diverse sewing patterns and corresponding 3D garments from in-the-wild images without requiring multi-view inputs or iterative optimization. The method offers efficient and scalable solution for realistic garment simulation and animation.

Conclusion: DressWild provides a novel feed-forward approach that overcomes limitations of existing methods by combining VLMs for pose normalization with transformer-based feature fusion, enabling efficient generation of physics-consistent sewing patterns and 3D garments from single images for practical garment modeling and fabrication applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in garment pattern generation have shown promising progress. However, existing feed-forward methods struggle with diverse poses and viewpoints, while optimization-based approaches are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. This paper focuses on sewing pattern generation for garment modeling and fabrication applications that demand editable, separable, and simulation-ready garments. We propose DressWild, a novel feed-forward pipeline that reconstructs physics-consistent 2D sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from a single in-the-wild image. Given an input image, our method leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to normalize pose variations at the image level, then extract pose-aware, 3D-informed garment features. These features are fused through a transformer-based encoder and subsequently used to predict sewing pattern parameters, which can be directly applied to physical simulation, texture synthesis, and multi-layer virtual try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach robustly recovers diverse sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from in-the-wild images without requiring multi-view inputs or iterative optimization, offering an efficient and scalable solution for realistic garment simulation and animation.

*Kaiting Liu,Hazel Doughty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot method to edit video classifiers by splitting coarse categories into finer subcategories without retraining or new annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video recognition models use fixed, coarse taxonomies that collapse fine-grained distinctions. When tasks evolve, retraining with new annotations is costly, creating a need for methods that can refine categories without full retraining.

Method: Proposes category splitting task with zero-shot editing leveraging latent compositional structure of video classifiers. Also uses low-shot fine-tuning that benefits from zero-shot initialization.

Result: Method substantially outperforms vision-language baselines on new video benchmarks, improving accuracy on split categories without sacrificing performance elsewhere.

Conclusion: Category splitting enables efficient refinement of video classifiers to accommodate evolving distinctions, with zero-shot editing and low-shot fine-tuning providing effective solutions without costly retraining.

Abstract: Video recognition models are typically trained on fixed taxonomies which are often too coarse, collapsing distinctions in object, manner or outcome under a single label. As tasks and definitions evolve, such models cannot accommodate emerging distinctions and collecting new annotations and retraining to accommodate such changes is costly. To address these challenges, we introduce category splitting, a new task where an existing classifier is edited to refine a coarse category into finer subcategories, while preserving accuracy elsewhere. We propose a zero-shot editing method that leverages the latent compositional structure of video classifiers to expose fine-grained distinctions without additional data. We further show that low-shot fine-tuning, while simple, is highly effective and benefits from our zero-shot initialization. Experiments on our new video benchmarks for category splitting demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms vision-language baselines, improving accuracy on the newly split categories without sacrificing performance on the rest.

TL;DR: Novel face morphing attack technique using Arc2Face foundation model achieves comparable attack potential to traditional landmark-based methods, posing significant threat to face recognition systems in identity documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face morphing attacks exploit vulnerabilities in passport enrollment procedures where facial images are often captured without supervised live processes, making them a major threat to face recognition systems in electronic identity documents.

Method: Proposes a novel face morphing technique based on Arc2Face, an identity-conditioned face foundation model that synthesizes photorealistic facial images from compact identity representations.

Result: The approach achieves morphing attack potential comparable to traditional landmark-based techniques (considered most challenging) when tested on two large-scale sequestered face morphing attack detection datasets and two novel morphed face datasets (FEI and ONOT).

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning-based method effectively preserves and manages identity information during morph generation, confirming its ability to create sophisticated morphing attacks that challenge current face recognition security systems.

Abstract: Face morphing attacks are widely recognized as one of the most challenging threats to face recognition systems used in electronic identity documents. These attacks exploit a critical vulnerability in passport enrollment procedures adopted by many countries, where the facial image is often acquired without a supervised live capture process. In this paper, we propose a novel face morphing technique based on Arc2Face, an identity-conditioned face foundation model capable of synthesizing photorealistic facial images from compact identity representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing the morphing attack potential metric on two large-scale sequestered face morphing attack detection datasets against several state-of-the-art morphing methods, as well as on two novel morphed face datasets derived from FEI and ONOT. Experimental results show that the proposed deep learning-based approach achieves a morphing attack potential comparable to that of landmark-based techniques, which have traditionally been regarded as the most challenging. These findings confirm the ability of the proposed method to effectively preserve and manage identity information during the morph generation process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Street-view image attribute classification is computationally demanding, and existing CLIP adaptation methods rely on global embeddings, failing to capture fine-grained local attributes needed for complex street scenes.

Method: Proposes CLIP-MHAdapter, a lightweight variant that appends a bottleneck MLP with multi-head self-attention operating on patch tokens to model inter-patch dependencies, using only ~1.4M trainable parameters.

Result: Achieves superior or competitive accuracy across eight attribute classification tasks on Global StreetScapes dataset, attaining new state-of-the-art results while maintaining low computational cost.

Conclusion: CLIP-MHAdapter effectively addresses the limitations of global embeddings in CLIP adaptations by capturing fine-grained local attributes through patch-level attention, offering an efficient solution for street-view classification tasks.

Abstract: Street-view image attribute classification is a vital downstream task of image classification, enabling applications such as autonomous driving, urban analytics, and high-definition map construction. It remains computationally demanding whether training from scratch, initialising from pre-trained weights, or fine-tuning large models. Although pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP offer rich image representations, existing adaptation or fine-tuning methods often rely on their global image embeddings, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained, localised attributes essential in complex, cluttered street scenes. To address this, we propose CLIP-MHAdapter, a variant of the current lightweight CLIP adaptation paradigm that appends a bottleneck MLP equipped with multi-head self-attention operating on patch tokens to model inter-patch dependencies. With approximately 1.4 million trainable parameters, CLIP-MHAdapter achieves superior or competitive accuracy across eight attribute classification tasks on the Global StreetScapes dataset, attaining new state-of-the-art results while maintaining low computational cost.

TL;DR: SSB framework integrates self-supervised semantic priors into diffusion bridge models for unpaired image translation without cross-domain supervision, achieving better spatial fidelity and generalization than adversarial or diffusion-inversion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for unpaired image-to-image translation have limitations: adversarial approaches require target-domain adversarial loss during training (limiting generalization to unseen data), while diffusion-inversion methods often produce low-fidelity translations due to imperfect inversion into noise-latent representations.

Method: Proposes Self-Supervised Semantic Bridge (SSB) framework that integrates external semantic priors into diffusion bridge models. Uses self-supervised visual encoders to learn representations invariant to appearance changes but capturing geometric structure, forming a shared latent space that conditions the diffusion bridges.

Result: SSB outperforms strong prior methods for challenging medical image synthesis in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, and extends easily to high-quality text-guided editing.

Conclusion: SSB provides a versatile framework for spatially faithful image translation without cross-domain supervision by leveraging self-supervised semantic priors, addressing key limitations of existing adversarial and diffusion-inversion approaches.

Abstract: Adversarial diffusion and diffusion-inversion methods have advanced unpaired image-to-image translation, but each faces key limitations. Adversarial approaches require target-domain adversarial loss during training, which can limit generalization to unseen data, while diffusion-inversion methods often produce low-fidelity translations due to imperfect inversion into noise-latent representations. In this work, we propose the Self-Supervised Semantic Bridge (SSB), a versatile framework that integrates external semantic priors into diffusion bridge models to enable spatially faithful translation without cross-domain supervision. Our key idea is to leverage self-supervised visual encoders to learn representations that are invariant to appearance changes but capture geometric structure, forming a shared latent space that conditions the diffusion bridges. Extensive experiments show that SSB outperforms strong prior methods for challenging medical image synthesis in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, and extends easily to high-quality text-guided editing.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel end-to-end framework for consistent online HD vectorized map construction that jointly performs map instance tracking and short-term prediction to address temporal inconsistencies in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing query-based methods for HD map construction suffer from temporal inconsistencies and instabilities due to random query initialization and implicit temporal modeling, which hinder reliable autonomous driving navigation.

Method: Introduces four key components: 1) Semantic-Aware Query Generator for spatially aligned semantic mask initialization, 2) History Rasterized Map Memory for storing fine-grained instance-level maps, 3) History-Map Guidance Module for integrating historical priors into track queries, and 4) Short-Term Future Guidance module for motion forecasting to maintain temporal consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with good efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses temporal inconsistency issues in HD map construction through explicit historical modeling and future guidance, providing more stable and reliable map representations for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are crucial to autonomous driving, providing structured representations of road elements to support navigation and planning. However, existing query-based methods often employ random query initialization and depend on implicit temporal modeling, which lead to temporal inconsistencies and instabilities during the construction of a global map. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework for consistent online HD vectorized map construction, which jointly performs map instance tracking and short-term prediction. First, we propose a Semantic-Aware Query Generator that initializes queries with spatially aligned semantic masks to capture scene-level context globally. Next, we design a History Rasterized Map Memory to store fine-grained instance-level maps for each tracked instance, enabling explicit historical priors. A History-Map Guidance Module then integrates rasterized map information into track queries, improving temporal continuity. Finally, we propose a Short-Term Future Guidance module to forecast the immediate motion of map instances based on the stored history trajectories. These predicted future locations serve as hints for tracked instances to further avoid implausible predictions and keep temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with good efficiency.

*Yingyuan Yang,Tian Lan,Yifei Gao,Yimeng Lu,Wenjun He,Meng Wang,Chenghao Liu,Chen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VETime is a novel time-series anomaly detection framework that unifies 1D temporal and 2D visual modalities through fine-grained alignment and dynamic fusion to overcome the trade-off between pointwise localization and global context understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models face a fundamental trade-off: 1D temporal models provide fine-grained pointwise localization but lack global contextual perspective, while 2D vision-based models capture global patterns but suffer from information bottlenecks due to lack of temporal alignment and coarse-grained detection.

Method: VETime introduces: 1) Reversible Image Conversion and Patch-Level Temporal Alignment to establish shared visual-temporal timeline; 2) Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning mechanism; 3) Task-Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion to adaptively integrate complementary perceptual strengths of both modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate VETime significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot scenarios, achieving superior localization precision with lower computational overhead than current vision-based approaches.

Conclusion: VETime successfully resolves the dilemma between temporal and visual modalities for time-series anomaly detection by unifying them through fine-grained alignment and dynamic fusion, offering improved performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) requires identifying both immediate Point Anomalies and long-range Context Anomalies. However, existing foundation models face a fundamental trade-off: 1D temporal models provide fine-grained pointwise localization but lack a global contextual perspective, while 2D vision-based models capture global patterns but suffer from information bottlenecks due to a lack of temporal alignment and coarse-grained pointwise detection. To resolve this dilemma, we propose VETime, the first TSAD framework that unifies temporal and visual modalities through fine-grained visual-temporal alignment and dynamic fusion. VETime introduces a Reversible Image Conversion and a Patch-Level Temporal Alignment module to establish a shared visual-temporal timeline, preserving discriminative details while maintaining temporal sensitivity. Furthermore, we design an Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning mechanism and a Task-Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion to adaptively integrate the complementary perceptual strengths of both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VETime significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot scenarios, achieving superior localization precision with lower computational overhead than current vision-based approaches.

TL;DR: SAW-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness in multimodal foundation models using real-world videos, revealing a 37.66% performance gap between humans and the best model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on environment-centric spatial relations but overlook observer-centric relationships that require reasoning relative to agent's viewpoint, pose, and motion. There's a need to evaluate models' ability to understand physically grounded, observer-centric dynamics.

Method: Created SAW-Bench with 786 self-recorded videos using Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses across diverse environments, with 2,071 human-annotated QA pairs. Probes observer-centric understanding through six different awareness tasks.

Result: Found a 37.66% human-model performance gap even with Gemini 3 Flash. Models can exploit partial geometric cues but often fail to infer coherent camera geometry, leading to systematic spatial reasoning errors.

Conclusion: SAW-Bench positions as a benchmark for situated spatial intelligence, moving beyond passive observation to understanding physically grounded, observer-centric dynamics, highlighting significant limitations in current multimodal foundation models.

Abstract: A core aspect of human perception is situated awareness, the ability to relate ourselves to the surrounding physical environment and reason over possible actions in context. However, most existing benchmarks for multimodal foundation models (MFMs) emphasize environment-centric spatial relations (relations among objects in a scene), while largely overlooking observer-centric relationships that require reasoning relative to agent's viewpoint, pose, and motion. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAW-Bench (Situated Awareness in the Real World), a novel benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness using real-world videos. SAW-Bench comprises 786 self-recorded videos captured with Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses spanning diverse indoor and outdoor environments, and over 2,071 human-annotated question-answer pairs. It probes a model's observer-centric understanding with six different awareness tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 37.66%, even with the best-performing MFM, Gemini 3 Flash. Beyond this gap, our in-depth analysis uncovers several notable findings; for example, while models can exploit partial geometric cues in egocentric videos, they often fail to infer a coherent camera geometry, leading to systematic spatial reasoning errors. We position SAW-Bench as a benchmark for situated spatial intelligence, moving beyond passive observation to understanding physically grounded, observer-centric dynamics.

*Ferdinand Kapl,Amir Mohammad Karimi Mamaghan,Maximilian Seitzer,Karl Henrik Johansson,Carsten Marr,Stefan Bauer,Andrea Dittadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Object-centric representations outperform dense vision encoders in challenging compositional generalization tasks, especially when constrained by data size, diversity, or compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate whether object-centric representations truly support compositional generalization in visually rich settings, as often claimed but with limited evidence.

Method: Created a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three controlled visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, MOVi-C) to test generalization to unseen property combinations. Compared DINOv2 and SigLIP2 vision encoders with their object-centric counterparts, controlling for training data diversity, sample size, representation size, downstream model capacity, and compute.

Result: 1) Object-centric approaches excel in harder compositional generalization settings; 2) Dense representations only surpass OC in easier settings and require more downstream compute; 3) OC models are more sample efficient, achieving better generalization with fewer images.

Conclusion: Object-centric representations provide stronger compositional generalization when constrained by dataset size, training data diversity, or downstream compute, making them particularly valuable for resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to reason about novel combinations of familiar concepts, is fundamental to human cognition and a critical challenge for machine learning. Object-centric (OC) representations, which encode a scene as a set of objects, are often argued to support such generalization, but systematic evidence in visually rich settings is limited. We introduce a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three controlled visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, and MOVi-C) to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for training data diversity, sample size, representation size, downstream model capacity, and compute. We use DINOv2 and SigLIP2, two widely used vision encoders, as the foundation models and their OC counterparts. Our key findings reveal that (1) OC approaches are superior in harder compositional generalization settings; (2) original dense representations surpass OC only on easier settings and typically require substantially more downstream compute; and (3) OC models are more sample efficient, achieving stronger generalization with fewer images, whereas dense encoders catch up or surpass them only with sufficient data and diversity. Overall, object-centric representations offer stronger compositional generalization when any one of dataset size, training data diversity, or downstream compute is constrained.

*Mingjia Shi,Yinhan He,Yaochen Zhu,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAP (Saliency-Aware Principle selection) enables VLMs to dynamically re-consult visual evidence during reasoning, reducing object hallucination and improving stability compared to standard CoT approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs face challenges in inference-time scaling because visual inputs are only provided once at generation start, causing reasoning to become text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Additionally, vanilla guidance for visual grounding is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts.

Method: Proposes Saliency-Aware Principle (SAP) selection that operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories. This enables stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. SAP also supports multi-route inference for parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. The approach is model-agnostic, data-free, and requires no additional training.

Result: SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets. It yields more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning.

Conclusion: SAP provides an effective approach for enabling VLMs to dynamically re-consult visual evidence during reasoning, addressing key limitations of current VLM inference methods and improving both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) aim to reason by jointly leveraging visual and textual modalities. While allocating additional inference-time computation has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), achieving similar scaling in VLMs remains challenging. A key obstacle is that visual inputs are typically provided only once at the start of generation, while textual reasoning (e.g., early visual summaries) is generated autoregressively, causing reasoning to become increasingly text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Moreover, vanilla guidance for visual grounding during inference is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts. To address these challenges, we propose \emph{Saliency-Aware Principle} (SAP) selection. SAP operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories, which enable stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. In addition, SAP supports multi-route inference, enabling parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. SAP is model-agnostic and data-free, requiring no additional training. Empirical results show that SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets while yielding more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning.

*Namitha Padmanabhan,Matthew Gwilliam,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeCoNeRV improves hypernetwork-based video compression by decomposing weight prediction spatially/temporally, using residual storage, and adding temporal coherence regularization to achieve better quality, lower bitrates, and higher resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hypernetwork-based approaches for video compression using Implicit Neural Representations have limitations: they predict INR weights quickly but with low quality, large compressed size, and prohibitive memory requirements at higher resolutions.

Method: Three key contributions: (1) spatial-temporal decomposition of weight prediction using patch tubelets to reduce memory overhead 20×; (2) residual-based storage scheme capturing differences between consecutive segment representations; (3) temporal coherence regularization framework aligning weight space changes with video content.

Result: Achieves 2.47dB and 5.35dB PSNR improvements over baseline at 480p and 720p on UVG, with 36% lower bitrates and 1.5-3× faster encoding speeds. First hypernetwork approach to demonstrate results at 480p, 720p and 1080p on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: TeCoNeRV addresses fundamental limitations of hypernetwork-based video compression, enabling efficient high-resolution video compression with improved quality, lower bitrates, and practical memory usage.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently demonstrated impressive performance for video compression. However, since a separate INR must be overfit for each video, scaling to high-resolution videos while maintaining encoding efficiency remains a significant challenge. Hypernetwork-based approaches predict INR weights (hyponetworks) for unseen videos at high speeds, but with low quality, large compressed size, and prohibitive memory needs at higher resolutions. We address these fundamental limitations through three key contributions: (1) an approach that decomposes the weight prediction task spatially and temporally, by breaking short video segments into patch tubelets, to reduce the pretraining memory overhead by 20$\times$; (2) a residual-based storage scheme that captures only differences between consecutive segment representations, significantly reducing bitstream size; and (3) a temporal coherence regularization framework that encourages changes in the weight space to be correlated with video content. Our proposed method, TeCoNeRV, achieves substantial improvements of 2.47dB and 5.35dB PSNR over the baseline at 480p and 720p on UVG, with 36% lower bitrates and 1.5-3$\times$ faster encoding speeds. With our low memory usage, we are the first hypernetwork approach to demonstrate results at 480p, 720p and 1080p on UVG, HEVC and MCL-JCV.

TL;DR: EdgeNav-QE optimizes Large Action Models for edge navigation using quantization and dynamic early-exit to reduce latency and memory while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Action Models (LAMs) show promise for autonomous navigation but face deployment challenges on edge devices due to memory constraints and latency requirements of multi-billion parameter models.

Method: Proposes EdgeNav-QE framework integrating Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) with dynamic early-exit mechanism. Quantizes backbone to 4-bit precision and strategically places early-exit branches to enable early termination for simple tasks while retaining full depth for complex decisions.

Result: Experimental results on Habitat-Sim with Matterport3D dataset using OpenVLA-7B backbone show: 82.7% reduction in inference latency, 66.7% reduction in memory footprint compared to full-precision baselines, while maintaining 81.8% navigation success rate. Outperforms state-of-the-art static early-exit method by 17.9% in latency.

Conclusion: EdgeNav-QE demonstrates effective optimization of LAMs for real-time edge navigation through quantization and adaptive computation, showing superiority of content-aware dynamic early-exit for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Large Action Models (LAMs) have shown immense potential in autonomous navigation by bridging high-level reasoning with low-level control. However, deploying these multi-billion parameter models on edge devices remains a significant challenge due to memory constraints and latency requirements. In this paper, we propose EdgeNav-QE, a novel framework that integrates Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) with a dynamic early-exit (DEE) mechanism to optimize LAMs for real-time edge navigation. By quantizing the backbone to 4-bit precision and strategically placing early-exit branches, we enable the model to terminate inference early for simple navigation tasks while retaining full depth for complex decision-making. Experimental results on the Habitat-Sim environment with Matterport3D dataset using OpenVLA-7B backbone, demonstrate that EdgeNav-QE reduces inference latency by 82.7% and memory footprint by 66.7% compared to full-precision baselines, while maintaining 81.8% navigation success rate. Furthermore, it outperforms state-of-the-art static early-exit method by 17.9% in latency, demonstrating the superiority of content-aware adaptive computation for safety-critical applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A two-stage simulation testing framework for autonomous driving systems that first searches for conflict scenarios (near-misses) and then mutates them into actual collisions, improving collision discovery diversity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ADS testing approaches focus mainly on scenarios already close to collisions, leaving many other hazardous situations unexplored. There's a need for more comprehensive and efficient safety evaluation methods that can discover diverse collision types.

Method: Proposes a two-stage framework: 1) Search for conflict scenarios (intermediate near-miss situations) as search targets, 2) Mutate these conflict scenarios to induce actual collisions. Uses conflict as an intermediate objective to broaden search horizon.

Result: The approach reveals up to 12 distinct collision types in a single run on Baidu Apollo, doubling the diversity discovered by state-of-the-art baselines while requiring fewer simulations due to conflict-targeted mutations.

Conclusion: Using conflicts as intermediate objectives broadens the search horizon and significantly improves both the efficiency and effectiveness of autonomous driving system safety evaluation in simulation-based testing.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems (ADS) are safety-critical and require rigorous testing before public deployment. Simulation-based scenario testing provides a safe and cost-effective alternative to extensive on-road trials, enabling efficient evaluation of ADS under diverse and high-risk conditions. However, existing approaches mainly evaluates the scenarios based on their proximity to collisions and focus on scenarios already close to collision, leaving many other hazardous situations unexplored. To bridge this, we introduce a collision-related concept of conflict as an intermediate search target and propose a two-stage scenario testing framework that first searches for conflicts and then mutates these conflict scenarios to induce actual collisions. Evaluated on Baidu Apollo, our approach reveals up to 12 distinct collision types in a single run, doubling the diversity discovered by state-of-the-art baselines while requiring fewer simulations thanks to conflict-targeted mutations. These results show that using conflicts as intermediate objectives broadens the search horizon and significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of ADS safety evaluation.

Conclusion: SceneVGGT provides robust semantic identification with memory and speed efficiency suitable for real-time assistive navigation applications, maintaining geometric consistency and temporal coherence for change detection.

Abstract: We present SceneVGGT, a spatio-temporal 3D scene understanding framework that combines SLAM with semantic mapping for autonomous and assistive navigation. Built on VGGT, our method scales to long video streams via a sliding-window pipeline. We align local submaps using camera-pose transformations, enabling memory- and speed-efficient mapping while preserving geometric consistency. Semantics are lifted from 2D instance masks to 3D objects using the VGGT tracking head, maintaining temporally coherent identities for change detection. As a proof of concept, object locations are projected onto an estimated floor plane for assistive navigation. The pipeline's GPU memory usage remains under 17 GB, irrespectively of the length of the input sequence and achieves competitive point-cloud performance on the ScanNet++ benchmark. Overall, SceneVGGT ensures robust semantic identification and is fast enough to support interactive assistive navigation with audio feedback.

*Yucheng Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TurboADMM is a specialized QP solver for multi-agent trajectory optimization that achieves near-linear complexity by combining ADMM decomposition, Riccati warmstart, and parametric QP hotstart.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QP solvers for multi-agent trajectory optimization fail to exploit temporal structure, agent decomposition, and iteration similarity simultaneously. General-purpose solvers (OSQP, MOSEK) treat problems monolithically and scale poorly with agent count, while structure-exploiting solvers (HPIPM) are vulnerable to dense coupling constraints.

Method: TurboADMM combines three complementary components: (1) ADMM decomposition creates parallel per-agent subproblems while preserving block-tridiagonal structure under dense coupling; (2) Riccati warmstart exploits temporal structure to provide high-quality primal-dual initialization for each agent's QP; (3) parametric QP hotstart in qpOASES reuses similar KKT system factorizations across ADMM iterations.

Result: The solver achieves empirically near linear complexity in agent count, enabling efficient solution of large coupled QPs at control rates for multi-agent trajectory optimization problems.

Conclusion: TurboADMM successfully addresses the scalability limitations of existing QP solvers for multi-agent trajectory optimization by systematically co-designing decomposition, warmstart, and hotstart techniques to exploit temporal structure, agent decomposition, and iteration similarity simultaneously.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory optimization with dense interaction networks require solving large coupled QPs at control rates, yet existing solvers fail to simultaneously exploit temporal structure, agent decomposition, and iteration similarity. One usually treats multi-agent problems monolithically when using general-purpose QP solvers (OSQP, MOSEK), which encounter scalability difficulties with agent count. Structure-exploiting solvers (HPIPM) leverage temporal structure through Riccati recursion but can be vulnerable to dense coupling constraints. We introduce TurboADMM, a specialized single-machine QP solver that achieves empirically near linear complexity in agent count through systematic co-design of three complementary components: (1) ADMM decomposition creates per-agent subproblems solvable in parallel, preserving block-tridiagonal structure under dense coupling; (2) Riccati warmstart exploits temporal structure to provide high-quality primal-dual initialization for each agent's QP; (3) parametric QP hotstart \footnote{In the paper, we refer warmstart as the technique that uses the Riccati equation results as auxiliary QP initialization for a single QP solve, while hotstart as reusing the QR factorization across QP solve iterations.}in qpOASES reuses similar KKT system factorizations across ADMM iterations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Systematic review of social XR-HRI research (2015-2025) reveals field dominated by lab simulations with poor reporting standards, passive robot stimuli, untapped XR capabilities, and homogeneous samples, proposing a 5-phase roadmap for maturation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XR has gained attention in HRI but remains underexplored in social robotics. The authors aim to map the field through systematic review to understand current practices, identify gaps, and propose directions for establishing social XR-HRI as a reliable research medium.

Method: Systematic review of 6,527 peer-reviewed articles from 2015-2025, with 33 meeting strict inclusion criteria. Analyzed: (1) XR/virtual robot usage and contexts, (2) data collection/analysis methods, (3) researcher/participant demographics, (4) challenges and future agendas.

Result: Social XR-HRI dominated by lab simulations with poor reporting of hardware/software/robot specs. Robots act as passive visual stimuli; XR's biosignal/logging capabilities remain untapped. Research teams/samples are tech-centric, Western, young, male with demographic reporting gaps. Limitations include hardware delays, small homogeneous samples, short study cycles.

Conclusion: Proposes 5-phase roadmap: methodological innovation, enhanced ecological validity (using application contexts), improved robot interaction quality, promoting sample diversity, developing social XR-HRI taxonomy. Essential for XR to mature from lab prototype to ecologically valid research instrument in social robotics.

Abstract: Over the past decade, extended reality (XR), including virtual, augmented, and mixed reality, gained attention as a research instrument in human-robot interaction studies, but remains underexplored in empirical investigations of social robotics. To map the field, we systematically reviewed empirical studies from 2015 to 2025. Of 6,527 peer-reviewed articles, only 33 met strict inclusion criteria. We examined (1) how XR and virtual social robots are used and in which contexts, (2) data collection and analysis methods, (3) demographics of the researchers and participants, and (4) the stated challenges and future agendas. Our findings show that social XR-HRI research is still dominated by laboratory simulations, while crucial specifications like used hardware, software, and robots are often not reported. Robots typically act as passive and less interactive visual stimuli, while the rich biosignal (e.g., eye-tracking) and logging functions of modern head-mounted displays remain largely untapped. The research teams and samples are predominantly tech-centric, Western, young, and male, with frequent gaps in demographic reporting. Key limitations include hardware delays, small homogeneous samples, and short, shallow study cycles. We propose a five-phase roadmap to establish social XR-HRI as a reliable research medium, which includes fostering methodological innovation, a reinforced ecological validity by, e.g., using application contexts, the improvement of the robot's interaction quality, promoting diversity in the sample and the development of a social XR-HRI taxonomy. Advancing in these directions is essential for XR to mature from a lab prototype into an ecologically valid research instrument for social robotics.

*Yuzhuo Ao,Anbang Wang,Yu-Wing Tai,Chi-Keung Tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReasonNavi is a zero-shot navigation framework that combines MLLMs for semantic reasoning with deterministic planners for execution, outperforming prior methods without requiring training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current embodied agents rely on partial egocentric observations, limiting global foresight and leading to inefficient exploration. Humans plan using maps by reasoning globally first, then acting locally.

Method: ReasonNavi converts top-down maps into discrete reasoning spaces via room segmentation and candidate target sampling. MLLMs are queried in multi-stage process to identify instruction-consistent candidates, then deterministic planners ground waypoints into executable trajectories using online-built occupancy maps with pretrained object detectors.

Result: Across three navigation tasks, ReasonNavi consistently outperforms prior methods that require extensive training or heavy scene modeling, offering scalable, interpretable, and globally grounded navigation.

Conclusion: ReasonNavi provides a unified zero-shot navigation framework that requires no MLLM fine-tuning, circumvents RL brittleness, and scales naturally with foundation model improvements, offering a human-inspired reason-then-act paradigm for embodied navigation.

Abstract: Embodied agents often struggle with efficient navigation because they rely primarily on partial egocentric observations, which restrict global foresight and lead to inefficient exploration. In contrast, humans plan using maps: we reason globally first, then act locally. We introduce ReasonNavi, a human-inspired framework that operationalizes this reason-then-act paradigm by coupling Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with deterministic planners. ReasonNavi converts a top-down map into a discrete reasoning space by room segmentation and candidate target nodes sampling. An MLLM is then queried in a multi-stage process to identify the candidate most consistent with the instruction (object, image, or text goal), effectively leveraging the model's semantic reasoning ability while sidestepping its weakness in continuous coordinate prediction. The selected waypoint is grounded into executable trajectories using a deterministic action planner over an online-built occupancy map, while pretrained object detectors and segmenters ensure robust recognition at the goal. This yields a unified zero-shot navigation framework that requires no MLLM fine-tuning, circumvents the brittleness of RL-based policies and scales naturally with foundation model improvements. Across three navigation tasks, ReasonNavi consistently outperforms prior methods that demand extensive training or heavy scene modeling, offering a scalable, interpretable, and globally grounded solution to embodied navigation.

TL;DR: MARVL uses fine-tuned Vision-Language Models to create dense rewards for robotic RL, addressing VLM misalignment issues through spatial-semantic consistency and multi-stage task decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual engineering of dense reward functions limits RL scalability and automation. Existing VLM-based rewards suffer from misalignment with task progress, poor spatial grounding, and limited task semantics understanding.

Method: Fine-tunes VLM for spatial and semantic consistency, decomposes tasks into multi-stage subtasks, and uses task direction projection for trajectory sensitivity.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing VLM-reward methods on Meta-World benchmark, showing superior sample efficiency and robustness on sparse-reward manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: MARVL provides an effective approach to automated dense reward design for robotic RL, overcoming key limitations of naive VLM-based reward methods.

Abstract: Designing dense reward functions is pivotal for efficient robotic Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, most dense rewards rely on manual engineering, which fundamentally limits the scalability and automation of reinforcement learning. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to reward design, naive VLM rewards often misalign with task progress, struggle with spatial grounding, and show limited understanding of task semantics. To address these issues, we propose MARVL-Multi-stAge guidance for Robotic manipulation via Vision-Language models. MARVL fine-tunes a VLM for spatial and semantic consistency and decomposes tasks into multi-stage subtasks with task direction projection for trajectory sensitivity. Empirically, MARVL significantly outperforms existing VLM-reward methods on the Meta-World benchmark, demonstrating superior sample efficiency and robustness on sparse-reward manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TVL models need test-time adaptation for real-world deployment, but existing methods fail when modalities become unreliable. The paper proposes a reliability-aware TTA framework that estimates per-modality reliability to filter samples, adaptively fuse features, and regularize optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world robotic and multimodal perception tasks face unavoidable test-time distribution shifts. Existing TTA methods work in unimodal settings but lack explicit treatment of modality-wise reliability under asynchronous cross-modal shifts, making them brittle when some modalities become unreliable.

Method: Proposes a reliability-aware TTA framework that estimates per-modality reliability from prediction uncertainty and perturbation-based responses. Uses this reliability signal to: (1) filter unreliable test samples, (2) adaptively fuse tactile, visual, and language features, and (3) regularize test-time optimization with a reliability-guided objective.

Result: On the TAG-C benchmark and additional TVL scenarios, the approach consistently outperforms strong TTA baselines, achieving accuracy gains of up to 49.9% under severe modality corruptions.

Conclusion: Explicit modality-wise reliability modeling is crucial for robust test-time adaptation of TVL models under asynchronous cross-modal shifts, enabling more reliable deployment in real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: Tactile-vision-language (TVL) models are increasingly deployed in real-world robotic and multimodal perception tasks, where test-time distribution shifts are unavoidable. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods provide filtering in unimodal settings but lack explicit treatment of modality-wise reliability under asynchronous cross-modal shifts, leaving them brittle when some modalities become unreliable. We study TTA for TVL models under such shifts and propose a reliability-aware framework that estimates per-modality reliability from prediction uncertainty and perturbation-based responses. This shared reliability signal is used to (i) filter unreliable test samples, (ii) adaptively fuse tactile, visual, and language features, and (iii) regularize test-time optimization with a reliability-guided objective. On the TAG-C benchmark and additional TVL scenarios, our approach consistently outperforms strong TTA baselines, achieving accuracy gains of up to 49.9\% under severe modality corruptions, underscoring the importance of explicit modality-wise reliability modeling for robust test-time adaptation.

*Zhenxing Xu,Brikit Lu,Weidong Bao,Zhengqiu Zhu,Junsong Zhang,Hui Yan,Wenhao Lu,Ji Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Fly0 decouples semantic reasoning from geometric planning in VLN using MLLMs for instruction grounding and geometric modules for 3D localization and trajectory planning, improving success rates by 20% and reducing navigation error by 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN methods face trade-offs between semantic understanding and control precision. MLLMs offer superior reasoning but as low-level controllers cause high latency, trajectory oscillations, and poor generalization due to weak geometric grounding.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: (1) MLLM-driven module grounds natural language instructions into 2D pixel coordinates; (2) geometric projection module uses depth data to localize targets in 3D space; (3) geometric planner generates collision-free trajectories. This decoupling enables robust navigation even when visual contact is lost.

Result: Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments show Fly0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving Success Rate by over 20% and reducing Navigation Error by approximately 50% in unstructured environments.

Conclusion: Fly0's decoupled approach eliminates continuous inference needs, reduces computational overhead, improves system stability, and enables robust navigation by separating semantic reasoning from geometric planning.

Abstract: Current Visual-Language Navigation (VLN) methodologies face a trade-off between semantic understanding and control precision. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer superior reasoning, deploying them as low-level controllers leads to high latency, trajectory oscillations, and poor generalization due to weak geometric grounding. To address these limitations, we propose Fly0, a framework that decouples semantic reasoning from geometric planning. The proposed method operates through a three-stage pipeline: (1) an MLLM-driven module for grounding natural language instructions into 2D pixel coordinates; (2) a geometric projection module that utilizes depth data to localize targets in 3D space; and (3) a geometric planner that generates collision-free trajectories. This mechanism enables robust navigation even when visual contact is lost. By eliminating the need for continuous inference, Fly0 reduces computational overhead and improves system stability. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that Fly0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving the Success Rate by over 20\% and reducing Navigation Error (NE) by approximately 50\% in unstructured environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FUTURE-VLA is a unified vision-language-action model that enables real-time long-horizon robot control and future forecasting with constant inference latency through adaptive compression and latent-space autoregression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models for robots suffer from prohibitive latency when processing long video histories and generating high-dimensional future predictions, limiting their real-time deployment capabilities.

Method: Uses dual-sided efficiency: 1) temporally adaptive compression to maximize spatiotemporal information density for processing extensive multi-view histories, and 2) latent-space autoregression to align actionable dynamics with visual look-aheads in a single forward pass. Includes prediction-guided Human-In-the-Loop mechanism via interactive execution gating.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: 99.2% success on LIBERO, 75.4% on RoboTwin, and 78.0% on real-world Piper platform, with 16× extended spatiotemporal window while maintaining single-frame baseline inference latency.

Conclusion: FUTURE-VLA successfully bridges the gap between unified spatiotemporal reasoning and real-time robot deployment by reformulating long-horizon control and future forecasting as a monolithic sequence-generation task with constant inference latency.

Abstract: General vision-language models increasingly support unified spatiotemporal reasoning over long video streams, yet deploying such capabilities on robots remains constrained by the prohibitive latency of processing long-horizon histories and generating high-dimensional future predictions. To bridge this gap, we present FUTURE-VLA, a unified architecture that reformulates long-horizon control and future forecasting as a monolithic sequence-generation task. Adopting a dual-sided efficiency paradigm, FUTURE-VLA leverages a temporally adaptive compression strategy to maximize spatiotemporal information density, enabling the ingestion of extensive multi-view histories while maintaining constant inference latency. Simultaneously, it performs latent-space autoregression to align actionable dynamics with reviewable visual look-aheads in a single forward pass. These real-time predictive capabilities further enable a prediction-guided Human-In-the-Loop mechanism via interactive execution gating, allowing operators to dynamically validate behaviors based on interpretable future previews. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FUTURE-VLA establishes new state-of-the-art performance, attaining success rates of 99.2% on LIBERO, 75.4% on RoboTwin, and 78.0% on a real-world Piper platform, all with a $16\times$ extended spatiotemporal window while maintaining the inference latency of a single-frame baseline.

*Zhiyuan Ren,Yudong Fang,Tao Zhang,Wenchi Cheng,Ben Lan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes AsymmetricHuberEKF, a physically-grounded filter that addresses non-negative NLOS biases in UAV-based post-disaster survivor localization by using an asymmetric loss function and active sensing strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust estimators fail in post-disaster scenarios because they assume symmetric error distributions, while NLOS propagation in collapsed structures creates strictly non-negative ranging biases, leading to Statistical-Geometric Degeneracy (SGD) where estimators stagnate.

Method: Proposes AsymmetricHuberEKF that incorporates non-negative physical prior of NLOS biases via an asymmetric loss function, and co-designs an active sensing strategy to provide the bilateral information needed to resolve SGD.

Result: Validated in 2D nadir-view scanning scenario, the approach significantly accelerates convergence compared to symmetric baselines, offering resilient performance in data-scarce, geometry-constrained disaster environments.

Conclusion: The physically-grounded AsymmetricHuberEKF framework effectively addresses the fundamental challenge of NLOS biases in post-disaster localization, where standard symmetric filters fail due to Statistical-Geometric Degeneracy, providing a practical solution for real-world search operations.

Abstract: Post-disaster survivor localization using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) faces a fundamental physical challenge: the prevalence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) propagation in collapsed structures. Unlike standard Gaussian noise, signal reflection from debris introduces strictly non-negative ranging biases. Existing robust estimators, typically designed with symmetric loss functions (e.g., Huber or Tukey), implicitly rely on the assumption of error symmetry. Consequently, they experience a theoretical mismatch in this regime, leading to a phenomenon we formally identify as Statistical-Geometric Degeneracy (SGD)-a state where the estimator stagnates due to the coupling of persistent asymmetric bias and limited observation geometry. While emerging data-driven approaches offer alternatives, they often struggle with the scarcity of training data and the sim-to-real gap inherent in unstructured disaster zones. In this work, we propose a physically-grounded solution, the AsymmetricHuberEKF, which explicitly incorporates the non-negative physical prior of NLOS biases via a derived asymmetric loss function. Theoretically, we show that standard symmetric filters correspond to a degenerate case of our framework where the physical constraint is relaxed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that resolving SGD requires not just a robust filter, but specific bilateral information, which we achieve through a co-designed active sensing strategy. Validated in a 2D nadir-view scanning scenario, our approach significantly accelerates convergence compared to symmetric baselines, offering a resilient building block for search operations where data is scarce and geometry is constrained.

TL;DR: SLAM research prioritizes benchmark accuracy over uncertainty estimation, creating brittle systems; authors advocate for uncertainty as primary success metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The SLAM community is stuck in a "Confidence Trap" - focusing too much on geometric accuracy benchmarks while neglecting proper uncertainty estimation, resulting in probabilistically inconsistent and brittle systems.

Method: The paper advocates for a paradigm shift rather than proposing a specific technical method. It calls for making consistent, real-time uncertainty computation a primary evaluation metric.

Result: The abstract presents a critical analysis rather than experimental results, identifying the problem of overconfidence in SLAM systems and proposing a new evaluation framework.

Conclusion: SLAM research needs to shift focus from pure geometric accuracy to principled uncertainty estimation as a core success metric to build more robust and reliable systems.

Abstract: The SLAM community has fallen into a "Confidence Trap" by prioritizing benchmark scores over principled uncertainty estimation. This yields systems that are geometrically accurate but probabilitistically inconsistent and brittle. We advocate for a paradigm shift where the consistent, real-time computation of uncertainty becomes a primary metric of success.

TL;DR: NOMAD enables autonomous driving policy adaptation to new cities using only map data and self-play reinforcement learning, eliminating the need for costly human demonstrations in target cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous vehicle deployment to new cities is expensive and slow due to the need for extensive human demonstration data collection in each target city, which differs in road geometry, traffic rules, and interaction patterns.

Method: NOMAD uses self-play multi-agent reinforcement learning in a simulator constructed from target-city map data, with a simple reward function, allowing policy adaptation without human demonstrations from the target city.

Result: NOMAD substantially improves both task success rate and trajectory realism in target cities, demonstrating effective adaptation using only map and meta-information.

Conclusion: NOMAD provides an effective and scalable alternative to data-intensive city-transfer methods for autonomous driving, enabling faster and cheaper deployment to new cities.

Abstract: While autonomous vehicles have achieved reliable performance within specific operating regions, their deployment to new cities remains costly and slow. A key bottleneck is the need to collect many human demonstration trajectories when adapting driving policies to new cities that differ from those seen in training in terms of road geometry, traffic rules, and interaction patterns. In this paper, we show that self-play multi-agent reinforcement learning can adapt a driving policy to a substantially different target city using only the map and meta-information, without requiring any human demonstrations from that city. We introduce NO data Map-based self-play for Autonomous Driving (NOMAD), which enables policy adaptation in a simulator constructed based on the target-city map. Using a simple reward function, NOMAD substantially improves both task success rate and trajectory realism in target cities, demonstrating an effective and scalable alternative to data-intensive city-transfer methods.

### [62] [Adaptive Illumination Control for Robot Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15900)
*Yash Turkar,Shekoufeh Sadeghi,Karthik Dantu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Lightning is a closed-loop illumination-control framework for visual SLAM that uses relighting, offline optimization, and imitation learning to optimize onboard programmable lighting for improved perception in challenging lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot perception under low light or high dynamic range conditions is limited by captured images. Traditional approaches (robust features, image enhancement, exposure control) are constrained by the original image quality. Programmable onboard lighting could help but its impact is hard to predict due to nonlinear interactions with depth, reflectance, and geometry.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Train CLID relighting model to decompose robot observations into ambient and light-contribution components, enabling synthesis of alternative lighting conditions. 2) Formulate offline Optimal Intensity Schedule (OIS) problem using synthesized data to select illumination levels balancing SLAM utility, power consumption, and smoothness. 3) Distill solution into real-time Illumination Control Policy (ILC) via behavior cloning that runs online on mobile robots.

Result: Lightning substantially improves SLAM trajectory robustness while reducing unnecessary illumination power consumption across evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenge of predicting illumination impact on image formation by combining relighting modeling, offline optimization, and imitation learning to create an effective real-time illumination control system for visual SLAM in challenging lighting conditions.

Abstract: Robot perception under low light or high dynamic range is usually improved downstream - via more robust feature extraction, image enhancement, or closed-loop exposure control. However, all of these approaches are limited by the image captured these conditions. An alternate approach is to utilize a programmable onboard light that adds to ambient illumination and improves captured images. However, it is not straightforward to predict its impact on image formation. Illumination interacts nonlinearly with depth, surface reflectance, and scene geometry. It can both reveal structure and induce failure modes such as specular highlights and saturation. We introduce Lightning, a closed-loop illumination-control framework for visual SLAM that combines relighting, offline optimization, and imitation learning. This is performed in three stages. First, we train a Co-Located Illumination Decomposition (CLID) relighting model that decomposes a robot observation into an ambient component and a light-contribution field. CLID enables physically consistent synthesis of the same scene under alternative light intensities and thereby creates dense multi-intensity training data without requiring us to repeatedly re-run trajectories. Second, using these synthesized candidates, we formulate an offline Optimal Intensity Schedule (OIS) problem that selects illumination levels over a sequence trading off SLAM-relevant image utility against power consumption and temporal smoothness. Third, we distill this ideal solution into a real-time controller through behavior cloning, producing an Illumination Control Policy (ILC) that generalizes beyond the initial training distribution and runs online on a mobile robot to command discrete light-intensity levels. Across our evaluation, Lightning substantially improves SLAM trajectory robustness while reducing unnecessary illumination power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous sailboats are ideal for long-term ocean observation due to wind-powered endurance, but their anisotropic performance and sensitivity to changing wind/current fields limit existing coverage methods like boustrophedon sweeping. Planning under these environmental and maneuvering constraints remains underexplored.

Method: A spatiotemporal coverage path planning framework combining: (1) topology-based morphological constraints in spatial domain for compact, continuous coverage, and (2) forecast-aware look-ahead planning in temporal domain to anticipate environmental evolution and enable foresighted decision-making.

Result: Simulations under stochastic inhomogeneous and time-varying ocean environments (including partial directional accessibility scenarios) show the method generates efficient, feasible coverage paths where traditional strategies often fail.

Conclusion: This study provides the first dedicated solution to coverage path planning for autonomous sailboats in inhomogeneous, time-varying ocean environments, establishing a foundation for future cooperative multi-sailboat coverage.

Abstract: Autonomous sailboats are well suited for long-duration ocean observation due to their wind-driven endurance. However, their performance is highly anisotropic and strongly influenced by inhomogeneous and time-varying wind and current fields, limiting the effectiveness of existing coverage methods such as boustrophedon sweeping. Planning under these environmental and maneuvering constraints remains underexplored. This paper presents a spatiotemporal coverage path planning framework tailored to autonomous sailboats, combining (1) topology-based morphological constraints in the spatial domain to promote compact and continuous coverage, and (2) forecast-aware look-ahead planning in the temporal domain to anticipate environmental evolution and enable foresighted decision-making. Simulations conducted under stochastic inhomogeneous and time-varying ocean environments, including scenarios with partial directional accessibility, demonstrate that the proposed method generates efficient and feasible coverage paths where traditional strategies often fail. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first dedicated solution to the coverage path planning problem for autonomous sailboats operating in inhomogeneous and time-varying ocean environments, establishing a foundation for future cooperative multi-sailboat coverage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models struggle with physical motion generalization in novel environments, as they focus on semantic understanding rather than learning physical dynamics of how the world evolves.

Method: DreamZero builds a World Action Model using a pretrained video diffusion backbone that jointly models video and action sequences to predict future world states and actions, learning from heterogeneous robot data without repetitive demonstrations.

Result: Achieves over 2x improvement in generalization to new tasks/environments vs state-of-the-art VLAs, real-time 7Hz closed-loop control with a 14B model, and cross-embodiment transfer with 42% improvement from video-only demonstrations and few-shot adaptation to new embodiments with just 30 minutes of data.

Conclusion: DreamZero demonstrates that modeling physical dynamics through video diffusion enables superior generalization and cross-embodiment transfer, representing a significant advance over semantic-focused VLA approaches for robotic control.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel at semantic generalization but struggle to generalize to unseen physical motions in novel environments. We introduce DreamZero, a World Action Model (WAM) built upon a pretrained video diffusion backbone. Unlike VLAs, WAMs learn physical dynamics by predicting future world states and actions, using video as a dense representation of how the world evolves. By jointly modeling video and action, DreamZero learns diverse skills effectively from heterogeneous robot data without relying on repetitive demonstrations. This results in over 2x improvement in generalization to new tasks and environments compared to state-of-the-art VLAs in real robot experiments. Crucially, through model and system optimizations, we enable a 14B autoregressive video diffusion model to perform real-time closed-loop control at 7Hz. Finally, we demonstrate two forms of cross-embodiment transfer: video-only demonstrations from other robots or humans yield a relative improvement of over 42% on unseen task performance with just 10-20 minutes of data. More surprisingly, DreamZero enables few-shot embodiment adaptation, transferring to a new embodiment with only 30 minutes of play data while retaining zero-shot generalization.

Motivation: Accurate spacecraft attitude control requires precise dynamics models, but physics-based models are difficult/computationally heavy for complex systems, while purely data-driven models have fragile stability and poor extrapolation.

Method: Use Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with physical constraints embedded during training, compared against conventional data-driven approach. Generate comprehensive dataset from high-fidelity simulations and deploy models within MPC architecture.

Result: Physics-regularized approach achieves 68.17% decrease in mean relative error. In MPC, physics-informed models yield superior tracking and robustness. Hybrid control combining learned nonlinear dynamics with nominal linear model reduces settling times by 61.52%-76.42% under noise/friction.

Conclusion: PINNs significantly improve spacecraft attitude dynamics modeling reliability and performance over purely data-driven methods, enabling better MPC control with faster response and improved robustness to uncertainties.

Abstract: Reliable spacecraft attitude control depends on accurate prediction of attitude dynamics, particularly when model-based strategies such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) are employed, where performance is limited by the quality of the internal system model. For spacecraft with complex dynamics, obtaining accurate physics-based models can be difficult, time-consuming, or computationally heavy. Learning-based system identification presents a compelling alternative; however, models trained exclusively on data frequently exhibit fragile stability properties and limited extrapolation capability. This work explores Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for modeling spacecraft attitude dynamics and contrasts it with a conventional data-driven approach. A comprehensive dataset is generated using high-fidelity numerical simulations, and two learning methodologies are investigated: a purely data-driven pipeline and a physics-regularized approach that incorporates prior knowledge into the optimization process. The results indicate that embedding physical constraints during training leads to substantial improvements in predictive reliability, achieving a 68.17% decrease in mean relative error relative. When deployed within an MPC architecture, the physics-informed models yield superior closed-loop tracking performance and improved robustness to uncertainty. Furthermore, a hybrid control formulation that merges the learned nonlinear dynamics with a nominal linear model enables consistent steady-state convergence and significantly faster response, reducing settling times by 61.52%-76.42% under measurement noise and reaction wheel friction.

We provide an open-source implementation and benchmark ODYN on the Maros-Mészáros test set, demonstrating state-of-the-art convergence performance in small-to-high-scale problems. The results highlight ODYN's superior warm-starting capabilities, which are critical in sequential and real-time settings common in robotics and AI. These advantages are further demonstrated by deploying ODYN as the backend of an SQP-based predictive control framework (OdynSQP), as the implicitly differentiable optimization layer for deep learning (ODYNLayer), and the optimizer of a contact-dynamics simulation (ODYNSim).

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Study analyzes impact of perception uncertainty calibration on autonomous vehicle planning, finding uncertainty-aware planners generalize better in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need to handle sensor uncertainty for safe operation, but current uncertainty-aware planners may be sensitive to prediction uncertainty miscalibration, which hasn't been well characterized.

Method: Compare two novel prediction-planning pipelines with varying uncertainty propagation levels using nuPlan benchmark. Evaluate impact of upstream uncertainty calibration through closed-loop testing on nuPlan challenge scenarios.

Result: Method incorporating upstream uncertainty propagation shows superior generalization to complex closed-loop scenarios compared to approaches with less uncertainty handling.

Conclusion: Proper uncertainty propagation and calibration in perception-based motion planning is crucial for autonomous vehicle performance in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are being increasingly deployed in urban environments. In order to operate safely and reliably, AVs need to account for the inherent uncertainty associated with perceiving the world through sensor data and incorporate that into their decision-making process. Uncertainty-aware planners have recently been developed to account for upstream perception and prediction uncertainty. However, such planners may be sensitive to prediction uncertainty miscalibration, the magnitude of which has not yet been characterized. Towards this end, we perform a detailed analysis on the impact that perceptual uncertainty propagation and calibration has on perception-based motion planning. We do so by comparing two novel prediction-planning pipelines with varying levels of uncertainty propagation on the recently-released nuPlan planning benchmark. We study the impact of upstream uncertainty calibration using closed-loop evaluation on the nuPlan challenge scenarios. We find that the method incorporating upstream uncertainty propagation demonstrates superior generalization to complex closed-loop scenarios.

TL;DR: ScenicRules is a benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems using prioritized multi-objective specifications in stochastic environments with formal scenario modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving benchmarks lack combinations of multi-objective prioritized rules and formal environment models needed to evaluate complex driving decisions where objectives conflict and require priority relations.

Method: 1) Formalize diverse objectives as quantitative metrics, 2) Design Hierarchical Rulebook framework encoding objectives and priorities interpretably, 3) Construct representative scenarios in Scenic language covering diverse driving contexts and near-accident situations.

Result: The formalized objectives and Hierarchical Rulebooks align well with human driving judgments, and the benchmark effectively exposes agent failures with respect to prioritized objectives.

Conclusion: ScenicRules provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems under prioritized multi-objective specifications with formal environment modeling, addressing gaps in existing evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Developing autonomous driving systems for complex traffic environments requires balancing multiple objectives, such as avoiding collisions, obeying traffic rules, and making efficient progress. In many situations, these objectives cannot be satisfied simultaneously, and explicit priority relations naturally arise. Also, driving rules require context, so it is important to formally model the environment scenarios within which such rules apply. Existing benchmarks for evaluating autonomous vehicles lack such combinations of multi-objective prioritized rules and formal environment models. In this work, we introduce ScenicRules, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous driving systems in stochastic environments under prioritized multi-objective specifications. We first formalize a diverse set of objectives to serve as quantitative evaluation metrics. Next, we design a Hierarchical Rulebook framework that encodes multiple objectives and their priority relations in an interpretable and adaptable manner. We then construct a compact yet representative collection of scenarios spanning diverse driving contexts and near-accident situations, formally modeled in the Scenic language. Experimental results show that our formalized objectives and Hierarchical Rulebooks align well with human driving judgments and that our benchmark effectively exposes agent failures with respect to the prioritized objectives.

*Théo Ayral,Saifeddine Aloui,Mathieu Grossard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hybrid learning/model-based approach adapts internal grasp forces to stop in-hand slip using multimodal tactile sensing and quadratic programming for rapid force updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve robust robotic grasping that can quickly detect and respond to slip events, combining the strengths of learned tactile sensing with model-based force control for rapid stabilization.

Method: Uses multimodal tactile stack: piezoelectric (PzE) sensing for fast slip detection and piezoresistive (PzR) arrays for contact localization. Online grasp matrix construction enables quadratic programming to update internal forces in the null space while preserving object wrench and respecting actuation limits.

Result: Achieves theoretical sensing-to-command latency of 35-40 ms, with slip detection at 20ms. Demonstrates closed-loop stabilization on multifingered grasps under external perturbations, showing both robustness and rapid reactions.

Conclusion: Combining efficient analytic force control with learned tactile cues enables both robustness and rapid slip response, with a clear pathway to sub-50 ms closed-loop stabilization for robotic grasping.

Abstract: We present a hybrid learning and model-based approach that adapts internal grasp forces to halt in-hand slip on a multifingered robotic gripper. A multimodal tactile stack combines piezoelectric (PzE) sensing for fast slip cues with piezoresistive (PzR) arrays for contact localization, enabling online construction of the grasp matrix. Upon slip, we update internal forces computed in the null space of the grasp via a quadratic program that preserves the object wrench while enforcing actuation limits. The pipeline yields a theoretical sensing-to-command latency of 35-40 ms, with 5 ms for PzR-based contact and geometry updates and about 4 ms for the quadratic program solve. In controlled trials, slip onset is detected at 20ms. We demonstrate closed-loop stabilization on multifingered grasps under external perturbations. Augmenting efficient analytic force control with learned tactile cues yields both robustness and rapid reactions, as confirmed in our end-to-end evaluation. Measured delays are dominated by the experimental data path rather than actual computation. The analysis outlines a clear route to sub-50 ms closed-loop stabilization.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes image-based measurement methods for autonomous forklift fork insertion using wide-angle camera to detect pallet pitch inclination and calibrate camera-fork coordinate systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable autonomous forklifts to automatically insert forks into pallet holes by accurately controlling fork height, reach, and tilt angle to match pallet position and orientation.

Method: Uses wide-angle camera fixed at forklift backrest to capture pallet images. Proposes two image measurement methods: 1) measuring pallet pitch inclination in camera coordinate system, and 2) acquiring calibration information between camera and fork coordinate systems for fork control application.

Result: Experimental evaluation showed errors within allowable range for safe fork insertion when comparing image measurements with hand measurements across varying pallet pitch angles, relative heights, and loaded/unloaded conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed image measurement methods using wide-angle camera can accurately measure pallet orientation and enable safe autonomous fork insertion for AGF systems.

Abstract: In order to insert a fork into a hole of a pallet by a forklift located in front of a pallet, it is necessary to control the height position, reach position, and tilt angle of the fork to match the position and orientation of the hole of the pallet. In order to make AGF (Autonomous Guided Forklift) do this automatically, we propose an image measurement method to measure the pitch inclination of the pallet in the camera coordinate system from an image obtained by using a wide-angle camera. In addition, we propose an image measurement method to easily acquire the calibration information between the camera coordinate system and the fork coordinate system necessary to apply the measurements in the camera coordinate system to the fork control. In the experiment space, a wide-angle camera was fixed at the backrest of a reach type forklift. The wide-angle images taken by placing a pallet in front of the camera were processed. As a result of evaluating the error by comparing the image measurement value with the hand measurement value when changing the pitch inclination angle of the pallet, the relative height of the pallet and the fork, and whether the pallet is loaded or not, it was confirmed that the error was within the allowable range for safely inserting the fork.

Conclusion: Framework enables robust, anticipatory failure detection for autonomous inspection tasks and provides feedback signal for model training to assess and improve training data quality.

Abstract: Autonomous inspection robots for monitoring industrial sites can reduce costs and risks associated with human-led inspection. However, accurate readings can be challenging due to occlusions, limited viewpoints, or unexpected environmental conditions. We propose a hybrid framework that combines supervised failure classification with anomaly detection, enabling classification of inspection tasks as a success, known failure, or anomaly (i.e., out-of-distribution) case. Our approach uses a world model backbone with compressed video inputs. This policy-agnostic, distribution-free framework determines classifications based on two decision functions set by conformal prediction (CP) thresholds before a human observer does. We evaluate the framework on gauge inspection feeds collected from office and industrial sites and demonstrate real-time deployment on a Boston Dynamics Spot. Experiments show over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between successes, failures, and OOD cases, with classifications occurring earlier than a human observer. These results highlight the potential for robust, anticipatory failure detection in autonomous inspection tasks or as a feedback signal for model training to assess and improve the quality of training data.

Abstract: Robots executing iterative tasks in complex, uncertain environments require control strategies that balance robustness, safety, and high performance. This paper introduces a safe information-theoretic learning model predictive control (SIT-LMPC) algorithm for iterative tasks. Specifically, we design an iterative control framework based on an information-theoretic model predictive control algorithm to address a constrained infinite-horizon optimal control problem for discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems. An adaptive penalty method is developed to ensure safety while balancing optimality. Trajectories from previous iterations are utilized to learn a value function using normalizing flows, which enables richer uncertainty modeling compared to Gaussian priors. SIT-LMPC is designed for highly parallel execution on graphics processing units, allowing efficient real-time optimization. Benchmark simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate that SIT-LMPC iteratively improves system performance while robustly satisfying system constraints.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A markerless multi-robot SLAM system using deep learning for 6D pose estimation to improve relative localization accuracy without relying on fiducial markers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-robot SLAM systems struggle with data association between different robots due to perceptual aliasing and perspective differences. Traditional solutions using calibrated fiducial marker arrays have limitations in range and fail under challenging lighting conditions like reflections or overexposure.

Method: Proposes a decentralized multi-robot SLAM system that leverages recent advances in deep learning-based 6D pose estimation to enable markerless pose estimation between robots, eliminating the need for fiducial markers.

Result: The system demonstrates improved relative localization accuracy among robotic teams and was experimentally validated using data recorded in a planetary analogous environment test field campaign.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based markerless pose estimation provides a robust solution for multi-robot SLAM data association, overcoming limitations of traditional fiducial marker approaches while improving relative localization accuracy in challenging environments.

Abstract: The capability of multi-robot SLAM approaches to merge localization history and maps from different observers is often challenged by the difficulty in establishing data association. Loop closure detection between perceptual inputs of different robotic agents is easily compromised in the context of perceptual aliasing, or when perspectives differ significantly. For this reason, direct mutual observation among robots is a powerful way to connect partial SLAM graphs, but often relies on the presence of calibrated arrays of fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTag arrays), which severely limits the range of observations and frequently fails under sharp lighting conditions, e.g., reflections or overexposure. In this work, we propose a novel solution to this problem leveraging recent advances in Deep-Learning-based 6D pose estimation. We feature markerless pose estimation as part of a decentralized multi-robot SLAM system and demonstrate the benefit to the relative localization accuracy among the robotic team. The solution is validated experimentally on data recorded in a test field campaign on a planetary analogous environment.

TL;DR: Machine learning models (random forest, neural networks, LSTM) accurately predict biohybrid muscle actuator forces, enabling performance optimization and adaptive control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biohybrid muscle actuators show promise for soft robotics but suffer from biological variability and nonlinearity, making them difficult to control and predict.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Static prediction models (random forest and neural network regressors) trained on muscle sample, stimulation parameters, and baseline force to predict maximum force; 2) Dynamic modeling using LSTM networks as digital twins to replicate force time series in response to stimulation.

Result: Both models achieve high accuracy: static models reach R²=0.9425, dynamic LSTM model achieves R²=0.9956, demonstrating excellent predictive capability.

Conclusion: Supervised learning effectively addresses biohybrid actuator variability, with static models enabling performance optimization and dynamic models providing foundation for adaptive control in future biohybrid robotic systems.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle-based biohybrid actuators have proved to be a promising component in soft robotics, offering efficient movement. However, their intrinsic biological variability and nonlinearity pose significant challenges for controllability and predictability. To address these issues, this study investigates the application of supervised learning, a form of machine learning, to model and predict the behavior of biohybrid machines (BHMs), focusing on a muscle ring anchored on flexible polymer pillars. First, static prediction models (i.e., random forest and neural network regressors) are trained to estimate the maximum exerted force achieved from input variables such as muscle sample, electrical stimulation parameters, and baseline exerted force. Second, a dynamic modeling framework, based on Long Short-Term Memory networks, is developed to serve as a digital twin, replicating the time series of exerted forces observed in response to electrical stimulation. Both modeling approaches demonstrate high predictive accuracy. The best performance of the static models is characterized by R2 of 0.9425, whereas the dynamic model achieves R2 of 0.9956. The static models can enable optimization of muscle actuator performance for targeted applications and required force outcomes, while the dynamic model provides a foundation for developing robustly adaptive control strategies in future biohybrid robotic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative transportation in narrow environments is challenging due to limited feasible regions, requiring safe inter-robot collaboration while maintaining high performance.

Method: Models task as cooperative constrained Markov game with collision avoidance constraints. Uses cost-advantage decomposition to enforce team constraints below upper bound, and constraint allocation to assign shared constraints to individual robots for autonomous task assignment.

Result: Superior performance and higher success rate in dual-quadruped collaborative transportation compared to existing methods, validated through simulation and real-time experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed safe RL approach with constraint decomposition and allocation enables effective collaborative transportation in narrow environments with guaranteed safety and improved task performance.

Abstract: Collaborative transportation, where multiple robots collaboratively transport a payload, has garnered significant attention in recent years. While ensuring safe and high-performance inter-robot collaboration is critical for effective task execution, it is difficult to pursue in narrow environments where the feasible region is extremely limited. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for dual-quadruped collaborative transportation via safe reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we model the task as a fully cooperative constrained Markov game, where collision avoidance is formulated as constraints. We introduce a cost-advantage decomposition method that enforces the sum of team constraints to remain below an upper bound, thereby guaranteeing task safety within an RL framework. Furthermore, we propose a constraint allocation method that assigns shared constraints to individual robots to maximize the overall task reward, encouraging autonomous task-assignment among robots, thereby improving collaborative task performance. Simulation and real-time experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance and a higher success rate in dual-quadruped collaborative transportation compared to existing methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots lack the ability to anticipate object motion, creating a gap between semantics, geometry, and kinematics for long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks.

Method: Temporally segments object interactions, uses occlusion-robust point tracking to infer motion, lifts trajectories to 3D, estimates articulation models via unified twist estimation, associates objects with articulations, and reasons about parent-child relations.

Result: Successfully builds semantic-kinematic scene graphs, validated on two datasets including the novel Arti4D-Semantic dataset with 600 object interactions, and enables robust manipulation on real robots in home environments.

Conclusion: MoMa-SG bridges the semantic-kinematic gap, allowing robots to understand and manipulate articulated objects in everyday environments, demonstrated through real-world experiments on mobile platforms.

Abstract: Semantics has enabled 3D scene understanding and affordance-driven object interaction. However, robots operating in real-world environments face a critical limitation: they cannot anticipate how objects move. Long-horizon mobile manipulation requires closing the gap between semantics, geometry, and kinematics. In this work, we present MoMa-SG, a novel framework for building semantic-kinematic 3D scene graphs of articulated scenes containing a myriad of interactable objects. Given RGB-D sequences containing multiple object articulations, we temporally segment object interactions and infer object motion using occlusion-robust point tracking. We then lift point trajectories into 3D and estimate articulation models using a novel unified twist estimation formulation that robustly estimates revolute and prismatic joint parameters in a single optimization pass. Next, we associate objects with estimated articulations and detect contained objects by reasoning over parent-child relations at identified opening states. We also introduce the novel Arti4D-Semantic dataset, which uniquely combines hierarchical object semantics including parent-child relation labels with object axis annotations across 62 in-the-wild RGB-D sequences containing 600 object interactions and three distinct observation paradigms. We extensively evaluate the performance of MoMa-SG on two datasets and ablate key design choices of our approach. In addition, real-world experiments on both a quadruped and a mobile manipulator demonstrate that our semantic-kinematic scene graphs enable robust manipulation of articulated objects in everyday home environments.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian SysID framework provides accurate joint estimation of robot states and parameters with computational efficiency, leading to improved model-based control performance in real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: We introduce a Bayesian system identification (SysID) framework for jointly estimating robot's state trajectories and physical parameters with high accuracy. It embeds physically consistent inverse dynamics, contact and loop-closure constraints, and fully featured joint friction models as hard, stage-wise equality constraints. It relies on energy-based regressors to enhance parameter observability, supports both equality and inequality priors on inertial and actuation parameters, enforces dynamically consistent disturbance projections, and augments proprioceptive measurements with energy observations to disambiguate nonlinear friction effects. To ensure scalability, we derive a parameterized equality-constrained Riccati recursion that preserves the banded structure of the problem, achieving linear complexity in the time horizon, and develop computationally efficient derivatives. Simulation studies on representative robotic systems, together with hardware experiments on a Unitree B1 equipped with a Z1 arm, demonstrate faster convergence, lower inertial and friction estimation errors, and improved contact consistency compared to forward-dynamics and decoupled identification baselines. When deployed within model predictive control frameworks, the resulting models yield measurable improvements in tracking performance during locomotion over challenging environments.

Conclusion: Reliable, untethered operations at depth are feasible, demonstrating the potential of resident ROV systems for scalable, cost-effective underwater monitoring that addresses current limitations in ocean observation.

Abstract: Our understanding of the oceans remains limited by sparse and infrequent observations, primarily because current methods are constrained by the high cost and logistical effort of underwater monitoring, relying either on sporadic surveys across broad areas or on long-term measurements at fixed locations. To overcome these limitations, monitoring systems must enable persistent and autonomous operations without the need for continuous surface support. Despite recent advances, resident underwater vehicles remain uncommon due to persistent challenges in autonomy, robotic resilience, and mechanical robustness, particularly under long-term deployment in harsh and remote environments. This work addresses these problems by presenting the development, deployment, and operation of a resident infrastructure using a docking station with a mini-class Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) at 90m depth. The ROVis equipped with enhanced onboard processing and perception, allowing it to autonomously navigate using USBL signals, dock via ArUco marker-based visual localisation fused through an Extended Kalman Filter, and carry out local inspection routines. The system demonstrated a 90% autonomous docking success rate and completed full inspection missions within four minutes, validating the integration of acoustic and visual navigation in real-world conditions. These results show that reliable, untethered operations at depth are feasible, highlighting the potential of resident ROV systems for scalable, cost-effective underwater monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuum manipulators in endoscopic surgery face challenges in accurate pose estimation and closed-loop control due to hysteresis, compliance, and limited sensing. Vision-based approaches are constrained by limited observability and computational overhead.

Method: Developed a stereo-aware multi-feature fusion network using segmentation masks, keypoints, heatmaps, and bounding boxes. Includes feed-forward rendering-based refinement for geometric consistency and self-supervised sim-to-real adaptation using unlabeled real data.

Result: Achieved mean translation error of 0.83 mm and rotation error of 2.76° in pose estimation. Markerless visual servoing achieved 2.07 mm translation error and 7.41° rotation error, with 85% and 59% reductions compared to open-loop control.

Conclusion: First fully markerless pose-estimation-driven visual servoing framework for continuum manipulators, enabling precise closed-loop control without physical markers or embedded sensing.

Abstract: Continuum manipulators in flexible endoscopic surgical systems offer high dexterity for minimally invasive procedures; however, accurate pose estimation and closed-loop control remain challenging due to hysteresis, compliance, and limited distal sensing. Vision-based approaches reduce hardware complexity but are often constrained by limited geometric observability and high computational overhead, restricting real-time closed-loop applicability. This paper presents a unified framework for markerless stereo 6D pose estimation and position-based visual servoing of continuum manipulators. A photo-realistic simulation pipeline enables large-scale automatic training with pixel-accurate annotations. A stereo-aware multi-feature fusion network jointly exploits segmentation masks, keypoints, heatmaps, and bounding boxes to enhance geometric observability. To enforce geometric consistency without iterative optimization, a feed-forward rendering-based refinement module predicts residual pose corrections in a single pass. A self-supervised sim-to-real adaptation strategy further improves real-world performance using unlabeled data. Extensive real-world validation achieves a mean translation error of 0.83 mm and a mean rotation error of 2.76° across 1,000 samples. Markerless closed-loop visual servoing driven by the estimated pose attains accurate trajectory tracking with a mean translation error of 2.07 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.41°, corresponding to 85% and 59% reductions compared to open-loop control, together with high repeatability in repeated point-reaching tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first fully markerless pose-estimation-driven position-based visual servoing framework for continuum manipulators, enabling precise closed-loop control without physical markers or embedded sensing.

Result: Achieves asymptotic stability under diverse perturbations, experimental validation shows high accuracy with less than 5 mm RMSE in center of mass trajectories during crawling and walking gaits.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a generalizable approach for integrating continuum soft legs into model-based locomotion control, advancing scalable and reusable modeling and control methods for soft quadruped robots.

Abstract: SLOT (Soft Legged Omnidirectional Tetrapod), a tendon-driven soft quadruped robot with 3D-printed TPU legs, is presented to study physics-informed modeling and control of compliant legged locomotion using only four actuators. Each leg is modeled as a deformable continuum using discrete Cosserat rod theory, enabling the capture of large bending deformations, distributed elasticity, tendon actuation, and ground contact interactions. A modular whole-body modeling framework is introduced, in which compliant leg dynamics are represented through physically consistent reaction forces applied to a rigid torso, providing a scalable interface between continuum soft limbs and rigid-body locomotion dynamics. This formulation allows efficient whole-body simulation and real-time control without sacrificing physical fidelity. The proposed model is embedded into a convex model predictive control framework that optimizes ground reaction forces over a 0.495 s prediction horizon and maps them to tendon actuation through a physics-informed force-angle relationship. The resulting controller achieves asymptotic stability under diverse perturbations. The framework is experimentally validated on a physical prototype during crawling and walking gaits, achieving high accuracy with less than 5 mm RMSE in center of mass trajectories. These results demonstrate a generalizable approach for integrating continuum soft legs into model-based locomotion control, advancing scalable and reusable modeling and control methods for soft quadruped robots.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboGene is an agentic framework that automatically generates diverse, physically plausible robotic manipulation tasks to address the scarcity of real-world robotic data, outperforming foundation models like GPT-4o and improving VLA model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation research suffers from limited real-world interaction data due to high physical collection costs. Existing methods are either unscalable (manual curation) or produce physically infeasible tasks (foundation models), creating a need for automated, high-quality task generation.

Method: RoboGene integrates three components: 1) diversity-driven sampling for broad task coverage, 2) self-reflection mechanisms to enforce physical constraints, and 3) human-in-the-loop refinement for continuous improvement. The framework generates tasks for single-arm, dual-arm, and mobile robots.

Result: The system collected 18k trajectories and introduced novel metrics for task quality assessment. RoboGene significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro). VLA models pre-trained with RoboGene data achieve higher success rates and better generalization in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: RoboGene successfully addresses the robotic data scarcity problem by automating the generation of diverse, physically plausible manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and enabling better VLA model training through high-quality task curation.

Abstract: The pursuit of general-purpose robotic manipulation is hindered by the scarcity of diverse, real-world interaction data. Unlike data collection from web in vision or language, robotic data collection is an active process incurring prohibitive physical costs. Consequently, automated task curation to maximize data value remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. Existing manual methods are unscalable and biased toward common tasks, while off-the-shelf foundation models often hallucinate physically infeasible instructions. To address this, we introduce RoboGene, an agentic framework designed to automate the generation of diverse, physically plausible manipulation tasks across single-arm, dual-arm, and mobile robots. RoboGene integrates three core components: diversity-driven sampling for broad task coverage, self-reflection mechanisms to enforce physical constraints, and human-in-the-loop refinement for continuous improvement. We conduct extensive quantitative analysis and large-scale real-world experiments, collecting datasets of 18k trajectories and introducing novel metrics to assess task quality, feasibility, and diversity. Results demonstrate that RoboGene significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro). Furthermore, real-world experiments show that VLA models pre-trained with RoboGene achieve higher success rates and superior generalization, underscoring the importance of high-quality task generation.

*Xiyuan Zhao,Huijun Li,Lifeng Zhu,Zhikai Wei,Xianyi Zhu,Aiguo Song*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a reactive motion planning framework for manipulators that tightly couples dynamic obstacle perception with model predictive control, using tensorized particle filtering for obstacle velocity estimation and MPPI-based planning that jointly propagates robot-obstacle dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reactive motion generation suffers from static perception assumptions and difficulty in modeling dynamic obstacles under uncertainty. There's a need to better connect reactive planning with dynamic mapping to handle perceptive and control uncertainty in unstructured environments.

Method: 1) Tensorized particle weight update scheme for dynamic obstacle perception that maintains obstacle velocities and covariance. 2) Obstacle-aware MPPI-based planning formulation that jointly propagates robot-obstacle dynamics to predict and evaluate future motion under uncertainty.

Result: The model predictive method significantly improves safety and reactivity in dynamic surroundings. The complete framework demonstrates consistent performance enhancement over state-of-the-art MPPI-based perception-planning baselines in both simulated and noisy real-world environments.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of robot-obstacle dynamics through tight coupling of dynamic perception and reactive planning consistently improves performance for manipulators avoiding multiple static and dynamic obstacles in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Reactive motion generation in dynamic and unstructured scenarios is typically subject to essentially static perception and system dynamics. Reliably modeling dynamic obstacles and optimizing collision-free trajectories under perceptive and control uncertainty are challenging. This article focuses on revealing tight connection between reactive planning and dynamic mapping for manipulators from a model-based perspective. To enable efficient particle-based perception with expressively dynamic property, we present a tensorized particle weight update scheme that explicitly maintains obstacle velocities and covariance meanwhile. Building upon this dynamic representation, we propose an obstacle-aware MPPI-based planning formulation that jointly propagates robot-obstacle dynamics, allowing future system motion to be predicted and evaluated under uncertainty. The model predictive method is shown to significantly improve safety and reactivity with dynamic surroundings. By applying our complete framework in simulated and noisy real-world environments, we demonstrate that explicit modeling of robot-obstacle dynamics consistently enhances performance over state-of-the-art MPPI-based perception-planning baselines avoiding multiple static and dynamic obstacles.

*Osher Azulay,Zhengjie Xu,Andrew Scheffer,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified fall recovery system for humanoids that uses privileged teacher distillation to achieve zero-shot generalization across complex terrains using only egocentric depth and proprioception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoids face unique fall recovery challenges due to high-energy impacts, complex whole-body contact, and large viewpoint changes during falls. Existing methods either fragment fall safety into separate problems or rely on end-to-end policies trained on flat terrain, limiting generalization to complex environments.

Method: Train a privileged teacher using sparse human demonstrations on flat terrain and simulated complex terrains, then distill it into a deployable student. The student learns by matching the teacher's goal-in-context latent representation that combines next target pose with local terrain, rather than separately encoding perception and action.

Result: Demonstrated robust, zero-shot fall safety across diverse non-flat environments in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid without real-world fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The approach provides a unified fall safety solution that spans all phases of fall recovery, leveraging constrained natural human poses and integrated perceptual-motor representations for generalization to complex terrains.

Abstract: Reliable fall recovery is critical for humanoids operating in cluttered environments. Unlike quadrupeds or wheeled robots, humanoids experience high-energy impacts, complex whole-body contact, and large viewpoint changes during a fall, making recovery essential for continued operation. Existing methods fragment fall safety into separate problems such as fall avoidance, impact mitigation, and stand-up recovery, or rely on end-to-end policies trained without vision through reinforcement learning or imitation learning, often on flat terrain. At a deeper level, fall safety is treated as monolithic data complexity, coupling pose, dynamics, and terrain and requiring exhaustive coverage, limiting scalability and generalization. We present a unified fall safety approach that spans all phases of fall recovery. It builds on two insights: 1) Natural human fall and recovery poses are highly constrained and transferable from flat to complex terrain through alignment, and 2) Fast whole-body reactions require integrated perceptual-motor representations. We train a privileged teacher using sparse human demonstrations on flat terrain and simulated complex terrains, and distill it into a deployable student that relies only on egocentric depth and proprioception. The student learns how to react by matching the teacher's goal-in-context latent representation, which combines the next target pose with the local terrain, rather than separately encoding what it must perceive and how it must act. Results in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate robust, zero-shot fall safety across diverse non-flat environments without real-world fine-tuning.

*Abhishek Goudar,Angela P. Schoellig*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Decentralized range-aided localization and formation control for robot teams using onboard odometry and inter-robot distance measurements, achieving decimeter-level accuracy without centralized coordination or specialized trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized approaches scale poorly and external localization systems may not always be available, necessitating decentralized solutions for coordinated robot team control.

Method: Block coordinate descent for localization without strict coordination, and novel factor graph formulation for formation control that accounts for state estimation uncertainty.

Result: Achieves decimeter-level positioning and formation control accuracy in real experiments with formation flights in diverse indoor/outdoor environments.

Conclusion: Completely decentralized approach enables effective range-aided localization and formation-based navigation without requiring specialized trajectories or centralized coordination.

Abstract: Controlling a team of robots in a coordinated manner is challenging because centralized approaches (where all computation is performed on a central machine) scale poorly, and globally referenced external localization systems may not always be available. In this work, we consider the problem of range-aided decentralized localization and formation control. In such a setting, each robot estimates its relative pose by combining data only from onboard odometry sensors and distance measurements to other robots in the team. Additionally, each robot calculates the control inputs necessary to collaboratively navigate an environment to accomplish a specific task, for example, moving in a desired formation while monitoring an area. We present a block coordinate descent approach to localization that does not require strict coordination between the robots. We present a novel formulation for formation control as inference on factor graphs that takes into account the state estimation uncertainty and can be solved efficiently. Our approach to range-aided localization and formation-based navigation is completely decentralized, does not require specialized trajectories to maintain formation, and achieves decimeter-level positioning and formation control accuracy. We demonstrate our approach through multiple real experiments involving formation flights in diverse indoor and outdoor environments.

### [87] [Sensor Query Schedule and Sensor Noise Covariances for Accuracy-constrained Trajectory Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16598)
*Abhishek Goudar,Angela P. Schoellig*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to determine optimal sensor parameters (measurement schedules and noise covariances) needed to achieve specific trajectory estimation accuracy for mobile robots, formulated as semidefinite programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectory estimation accuracy depends on sensor parameters like measurement rate and noise covariance, but cost/resource constraints limit these parameters. The paper aims to determine the minimum sensor requirements needed to achieve desired estimation accuracy.

Method: Formulates the problem of estimating sensor schedules and covariances as semidefinite programs (SDPs) that can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers. Two main problems: (1) determining measurement schedule for a sensor with known covariance, and (2) determining necessary sensor covariance for a given measurement rate.

Result: Validated in simulation and real experiments, showing that calculated sensor schedules and covariances achieve desired trajectory estimation accuracy. The method also identifies scenarios where certain accuracy levels are unachievable with given system/sensor characteristics.

Conclusion: The proposed SDP-based approach successfully determines optimal sensor parameters (schedules and covariances) to achieve specific trajectory estimation accuracy, providing a systematic way to balance estimation performance with sensor cost/resource constraints.

Abstract: Trajectory estimation involves determining the trajectory of a mobile robot by combining prior knowledge about its dynamic model with noisy observations of its state obtained using sensors. The accuracy of such a procedure is dictated by the system model fidelity and the sensor parameters, such as the accuracy of the sensor (as represented by its noise covariance) and the rate at which it can generate observations, referred to as the sensor query schedule. Intuitively, high-rate measurements from accurate sensors lead to accurate trajectory estimation. However, cost and resource constraints limit the sensor accuracy and its measurement rate. Our work's novel contribution is the estimation of sensor schedules and sensor covariances necessary to achieve a specific estimation accuracy. Concretely, we focus on estimating: (i) the rate or schedule with which a sensor of known covariance must generate measurements to achieve specific estimation accuracy, and alternatively, (ii) the sensor covariance necessary to achieve specific estimation accuracy for a given sensor update rate. We formulate the problem of estimating these sensor parameters as semidefinite programs, which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. We validate our approach in simulation and real experiments by showing that the sensor schedules and the sensor covariances calculated using our proposed method achieve the desired trajectory estimation accuracy. Our method also identifies scenarios where certain estimation accuracy is unachievable with the given system and sensor characteristics.

*Xihan Ma,Haichong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Autonomous robotic ultrasound system uses template-guided optimal pivoting for efficient kidney imaging, reducing probe footprint by 75mm compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional freehand ultrasound suffers from operator-dependent inconsistencies, lack of 3D localization, and musculoskeletal risks. Existing robotic systems lack optimal imaging window determination, leading to excessive probe footprint and acoustic shadowing.

Method: System performs explorative imaging to generate partial kidney observations, registers data to kidney template to estimate organ pose, then executes fixed-point pivoting sweep with imaging plane aligned to kidney long axis to minimize probe translation.

Result: Simulation: 60% exploration ratio optimal for balance between localization accuracy and efficiency. In-vivo: Kidney localization accuracy up to 7.36 mm and 13.84 degrees. Optimal pivoting shortened probe footprint by ~75 mm compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Template-guided optimal pivoting approach enables efficient kidney imaging with minimal probe footprint, validating the use of anatomical templates for optimal probe alignment in volumetric sweeps.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound (US) imaging is a frontline tool for the diagnosis of kidney diseases. However, traditional freehand imaging procedure suffers from inconsistent, operator-dependent outcomes, lack of 3D localization information, and risks of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. While robotic ultrasound (RUS) systems offer the potential for standardized, operator-independent 3D kidney data acquisition, the existing scanning methods lack the ability to determine the optimal imaging window for efficient imaging. As a result, the scan is often blindly performed with excessive probe footprint, which frequently leads to acoustic shadowing and incomplete organ coverage. Consequently, there is a critical need for a spatially efficient imaging technique that can maximize the kidney coverage through minimum probe footprint. Here, we propose an autonomous workflow to achieve efficient kidney imaging via template-guided optimal pivoting. The system first performs an explorative imaging to generate partial observations of the kidney. This data is then registered to a kidney template to estimate the organ pose. With the kidney localized, the robot executes a fixed-point pivoting sweep where the imaging plane is aligned with the kidney long axis to minimize the probe translation. The proposed method was validated in simulation and in-vivo. Simulation results indicate that a 60% exploration ratio provides optimal balance between kidney localization accuracy and scanning efficiency. In-vivo evaluation on two male subjects demonstrates a kidney localization accuracy up to 7.36 mm and 13.84 degrees. Moreover, the optimal pivoting approach shortened the probe footprint by around 75 mm when compared with the baselines. These results valid our approach of leveraging anatomical templates to align the probe optimally for volumetric sweep.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloth manipulation is a challenging robotics problem with practical applications in assistive care and service industries. The complex physics of deformable objects and the need for generalization across various cloth types, shapes, sizes, and patterns require careful consideration of model structure.

Method: Uses a modified DreamerV2 reinforcement learning architecture with surface normals input, enhanced replay buffer, and data augmentation procedures to improve world modeling for cloth physics.

Result: Evaluated in simulation and zero-shot deployment on physical robot, successfully performing in-air unfolding of various cloth types, demonstrating generalization benefits of the proposed architecture.

Conclusion: The modified DreamerV2 architecture with enhanced world modeling effectively addresses the physical complexity of cloth manipulation and enables generalization across different cloth types in both simulation and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Learning to manipulate cloth is both a paradigmatic problem for robotic research and a problem of immediate relevance to a variety of applications ranging from assistive care to the service industry. The complex physics of the deformable object makes this problem of cloth manipulation nontrivial. In order to create a general manipulation strategy that addresses a variety of shapes, sizes, fold and wrinkle patterns, in addition to the usual problems of appearance variations, it becomes important to carefully consider model structure and their implications for generalisation performance. In this paper, we present an approach to in-air cloth manipulation that uses a variation of a recently proposed reinforcement learning architecture, DreamerV2. Our implementation modifies this architecture to utilise surface normals input, in addition to modiying the replay buffer and data augmentation procedures. Taken together these modifications represent an enhancement to the world model used by the robot, addressing the physical complexity of the object being manipulated by the robot. We present evaluations both in simulation and in a zero-shot deployment of the trained policies in a physical robot setup, performing in-air unfolding of a variety of different cloth types, demonstrating the generalisation benefits of our proposed architecture.

TL;DR: HERO: A new paradigm combining large vision models for scene understanding with accurate residual-aware end-effector tracking for humanoid robot loco-manipulation in diverse real-world environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches based on real-world imitation learning have limited generalization due to difficulty collecting large-scale training datasets. Need accurate end-effector control and generalizable scene understanding for humanoid robots to manipulate arbitrary objects in the wild.

Method: Combines large vision models for open-vocabulary understanding with simulated training for control. Features residual-aware EE tracking policy that integrates: a) inverse kinematics for trajectory conversion, b) learned neural forward model for accurate kinematics, c) goal adjustment, and d) replanning. Uses modular system with vision models for visual generalization.

Result: Achieves 3.2x reduction in end-effector tracking error. System operates in diverse real-world environments (offices, coffee shops) and manipulates various everyday objects (mugs, apples, toys) on surfaces ranging from 43cm to 92cm in height. Effective in both simulation and real-world tests.

Conclusion: HERO demonstrates a new paradigm for humanoid robot loco-manipulation that combines the strengths of large vision models and simulated training, opening up new ways to train humanoid robots for daily object interaction.

Abstract: Visual loco-manipulation of arbitrary objects in the wild with humanoid robots requires accurate end-effector (EE) control and a generalizable understanding of the scene via visual inputs (e.g., RGB-D images). Existing approaches are based on real-world imitation learning and exhibit limited generalization due to the difficulty in collecting large-scale training datasets. This paper presents a new paradigm, HERO, for object loco-manipulation with humanoid robots that combines the strong generalization and open-vocabulary understanding of large vision models with strong control performance from simulated training. We achieve this by designing an accurate residual-aware EE tracking policy. This EE tracking policy combines classical robotics with machine learning. It uses a) inverse kinematics to convert residual end-effector targets into reference trajectories, b) a learned neural forward model for accurate forward kinematics, c) goal adjustment, and d) replanning. Together, these innovations help us cut down the end-effector tracking error by 3.2x. We use this accurate end-effector tracker to build a modular system for loco-manipulation, where we use open-vocabulary large vision models for strong visual generalization. Our system is able to operate in diverse real-world environments, from offices to coffee shops, where the robot is able to reliably manipulate various everyday objects (e.g., mugs, apples, toys) on surfaces ranging from 43cm to 92cm in height. Systematic modular and end-to-end tests in simulation and the real world demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed design. We believe the advances in this paper can open up new ways of training humanoid robots to interact with daily objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human behavior is a scalable data source for physical intelligence, but it's unclear how to effectively leverage large-scale human data for fine-grained, high-DoF dexterous manipulation tasks.

Method: Two-stage transfer: 1) Large-scale pretraining on 20,854 hours of action-labeled egocentric human video using Vision Language Action (VLA) model, 2) Lightweight aligned human-robot mid-training for transfer to real robots.

Result: Established log-linear scaling law between human data scale and validation loss (correlates with robot performance). Achieved 54% average success rate improvement over no-pretraining baseline using 22 DoF dexterous hand, with effective transfer to lower-DoF hands.

Conclusion: Large-scale human motion data provides a reusable, embodiment-agnostic motor prior that enables strong dexterous manipulation with minimal robot supervision, making human data a predictable supervision source for robot learning.

Abstract: Human behavior is among the most scalable sources of data for learning physical intelligence, yet how to effectively leverage it for dexterous manipulation remains unclear. While prior work demonstrates human to robot transfer in constrained settings, it is unclear whether large scale human data can support fine grained, high degree of freedom dexterous manipulation. We present EgoScale, a human to dexterous manipulation transfer framework built on large scale egocentric human data. We train a Vision Language Action (VLA) model on over 20,854 hours of action labeled egocentric human video, more than 20 times larger than prior efforts, and uncover a log linear scaling law between human data scale and validation loss. This validation loss strongly correlates with downstream real robot performance, establishing large scale human data as a predictable supervision source. Beyond scale, we introduce a simple two stage transfer recipe: large scale human pretraining followed by lightweight aligned human robot mid training. This enables strong long horizon dexterous manipulation and one shot task adaptation with minimal robot supervision. Our final policy improves average success rate by 54% over a no pretraining baseline using a 22 DoF dexterous robotic hand, and transfers effectively to robots with lower DoF hands, indicating that large scale human motion provides a reusable, embodiment agnostic motor prior.

TL;DR: A unified canonical representation framework for dexterous hands that enables cross-embodiment policy learning and zero-shot transfer across diverse hand morphologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dexterous manipulation policies assume fixed hand designs, limiting generalization to new embodiments with different kinematic and structural layouts. There's a need for a unified framework that can handle diverse hand architectures.

Method: Introduces a parameterized canonical representation with: 1) unified parameter space capturing morphological/kinematic variations, 2) structured latent manifold for smooth morphology transitions, and 3) canonical URDF format standardizing action space while preserving original dynamics. Uses VAE for latent encoding and trains grasping policies conditioned on the canonical representation.

Result: Achieves 81.9% zero-shot success rate on 3-finger LEAP Hand, demonstrates effective grasp policy replay, VAE latent encoding, and cross-embodiment transfer. The framework successfully unifies both representational and action spaces of structurally diverse hands.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable foundation for cross-hand learning toward universal dexterous manipulation by enabling policy generalization across diverse hand morphologies through unified representation and action spaces.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation policies today largely assume fixed hand designs, severely restricting their generalization to new embodiments with varied kinematic and structural layouts. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a parameterized canonical representation that unifies a broad spectrum of dexterous hand architectures. It comprises a unified parameter space and a canonical URDF format, offering three key advantages. 1) The parameter space captures essential morphological and kinematic variations for effective conditioning in learning algorithms. 2) A structured latent manifold can be learned over our space, where interpolations between embodiments yield smooth and physically meaningful morphology transitions. 3) The canonical URDF standardizes the action space while preserving dynamic and functional properties of the original URDFs, enabling efficient and reliable cross-embodiment policy learning. We validate these advantages through extensive analysis and experiments, including grasp policy replay, VAE latent encoding, and cross-embodiment zero-shot transfer. Specifically, we train a VAE on the unified representation to obtain a compact, semantically rich latent embedding, and develop a grasping policy conditioned on the canonical representation that generalizes across dexterous hands. We demonstrate, through simulation and real-world tasks on unseen morphologies (e.g., 81.9% zero-shot success rate on 3-finger LEAP Hand), that our framework unifies both the representational and action spaces of structurally diverse hands, providing a scalable foundation for cross-hand learning toward universal dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Accurate and computationally efficient 3D medical image segmentation remains a critical challenge in clinical workflows. Transformer-based architectures often demonstrate superior global contextual modeling but at the expense of excessive parameter counts and memory demands, restricting their clinical deployment. We propose RefineFormer3D, a lightweight hierarchical transformer architecture that balances segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency for volumetric medical imaging. The architecture integrates three key components: (i) GhostConv3D-based patch embedding for efficient feature extraction with minimal redundancy, (ii) MixFFN3D module with low-rank projections and depthwise convolutions for parameter-efficient feature extraction, and (iii) a cross-attention fusion decoder enabling adaptive multi-scale skip connection integration. RefineFormer3D contains only 2.94M parameters, substantially fewer than contemporary transformer-based methods. Extensive experiments on ACDC and BraTS benchmarks demonstrate that RefineFormer3D achieves 93.44\% and 85.9\% average Dice scores respectively, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art methods while requiring significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, the model achieves fast inference (8.35 ms per volume on GPU) with low memory requirements, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results establish RefineFormer3D as an effective and scalable solution for practical 3D medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Generating diagnostic text from histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) is challenging due to the gigapixel scale of the input and the requirement for precise, domain specific language. We propose a hierarchical vision language framework that combines a frozen pathology foundation model with a Transformer decoder for report generation. To make WSI processing tractable, we perform multi resolution pyramidal patch selection (downsampling factors 2^3 to 2^6) and remove background and artifacts using Laplacian variance and HSV based criteria. Patch features are extracted with the UNI Vision Transformer and projected to a 6 layer Transformer decoder that generates diagnostic text via cross attention. To better represent biomedical terminology, we tokenize the output using BioGPT. Finally, we add a retrieval based verification step that compares generated reports with a reference corpus using Sentence BERT embeddings; if a high similarity match is found, the generated report is replaced with the retrieved ground truth reference to improve reliability.

Conclusion: ROIX-Comp effectively addresses storage and computational constraints in HPC environments by intelligently compressing X-CT data through ROI-driven feature extraction and advanced compression techniques.

Abstract: In high-performance computing (HPC) environments, particularly in synchrotron radiation facilities, vast amounts of X-ray images are generated. Processing large-scale X-ray Computed Tomography (X-CT) datasets presents significant computational and storage challenges due to their high dimensionality and data volume. Traditional approaches often require extensive storage capacity and high transmission bandwidth, limiting real-time processing capabilities and workflow efficiency. To address these constraints, we introduce a region-of-interest (ROI)-driven extraction framework (ROIX-Comp) that intelligently compresses X-CT data by identifying and retaining only essential features. Our work reduces data volume while preserving critical information for downstream processing tasks. At pre-processing stage, we utilize error-bounded quantization to reduce the amount of data to be processed and therefore improve computational efficiencies. At the compression stage, our methodology combines object extraction with multiple state-of-the-art lossless and lossy compressors, resulting in significantly improved compression ratios. We evaluated this framework against seven X-CT datasets and observed a relative compression ratio improvement of 12.34x compared to the standard compression.

Conclusion: The framework provides accurate automated feedback for kidney phantom training, enabling out-of-OR training without expert supervision, addressing current clinical training deficiencies.

Abstract: Purpose: Kidney ureteroscopic navigation is challenging with a steep learning curve. However, current clinical training has major deficiencies, as it requires one-on-one feedback from experts and occurs in the operating room (OR). Therefore, there is a need for a phantom training system with automated feedback to greatly \revision{expand} training opportunities.
  Methods: We propose a novel, purely ureteroscope video-based scope localization framework that automatically identifies calyces missed by the trainee in a phantom kidney exploration. We use a slow, thorough, prior exploration video of the kidney to generate a reference reconstruction. Then, this reference reconstruction can be used to localize any exploration video of the same phantom.
  Results: In 15 exploration videos, a total of 69 out of 74 calyces were correctly classified. We achieve < 4mm camera pose localization error. Given the reference reconstruction, the system takes 10 minutes to generate the results for a typical exploration (1-2 minute long).
  Conclusion: We demonstrate a novel camera localization framework that can provide accurate and automatic feedback for kidney phantom explorations. We show its ability as a valid tool that enables out-of-OR training without requiring supervision from an expert.

Conclusion: NeuroSleep bridges neuromorphic encoding with state-aware modeling to provide a scalable solution for always-on sleep analysis in resource-constrained wearable scenarios.

Abstract: Reliable, continuous neural sensing on wearable edge platforms is fundamental to long-term health monitoring; however, for electroencephalography (EEG)-based sleep monitoring, dense high-frequency processing is often computationally prohibitive under tight energy budgets. To address this bottleneck, this paper proposes NeuroSleep, an integrated event-driven sensing and inference system for energy-efficient sleep staging. NeuroSleep first converts raw EEG into complementary multi-scale bipolar event streams using Residual Adaptive Multi-Scale Delta Modulation (R-AMSDM), enabling an explicit fidelity-sparsity trade-off at the sensing front end. Furthermore, NeuroSleep adopts a hierarchical inference architecture that comprises an Event-based Adaptive Multi-scale Response (EAMR) module for local feature extraction, a Local Temporal-Attention Module (LTAM) for context aggregation, and an Epoch-Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ELIF) module to capture long-term state persistence. Experimental results using subject-independent 5-fold cross-validation on the Sleep-EDF Expanded dataset demonstrate that NeuroSleep achieves a mean accuracy of 74.2% with only 0.932 M parameters while reducing sparsity-adjusted effective operations by approximately 53.6% relative to dense processing. Compared with the representative dense Transformer baseline, NeuroSleep improves accuracy by 7.5% with a 45.8% reduction in computational load. By bridging neuromorphic encoding with state-aware modeling, NeuroSleep provides a scalable solution for always-on sleep analysis in resource-constrained wearable scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes vibration patterns in FDM 3D printers, specifically the MakerBot Method X, using accelerometer and acoustic sensors to measure vibrations and sound during printing operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vibration from disturbances harms manufactured components and lowers output quality in FDM printing. Since additive manufacturing relies on mechanical extruder movement, unwanted vibrations cause faults, making vibration analysis crucial for quality control.

Method: Used accelerometer and acoustic sensors to measure vibration and sound produced by the MakerBot Method X printer. Sensor outputs were examined individually to understand motion patterns and detect printer conditions.

Result: Vibration occurs at relatively low levels during continuous motion, mainly appearing at component transition edges. Vibration reaches its peak during zigzag motion due to abrupt acceleration and deceleration.

Conclusion: Understanding vibration patterns in FDM printers is essential for quality control, with zigzag motions causing the highest vibration levels due to acceleration/deceleration effects.

Abstract: Vibration from an erroneous disturbance harms the manufactured components and lowers the output quality of an FDM printer. For moving machinery, vibration analysis and control are crucial. Additive manufacturing is the basis of 3D printing, which utilizes mechanical movement of the extruder to fabricate objects, and faults occur due to unwanted vibrations. Therefore, it is vital to examine the vibration patterns of a 3D printer. In this work, we observe these parameters of an FDM printer, exemplified by the MakerBot Method X. To analyze the system, it is necessary to understand the motion it generates and select appropriate sensors to detect those motions. The sensor measurement values can be used to determine the condition of the printer. We used an accelerometer and an acoustic sensor to measure the vibration and sound produced by the printer. The outputs from these sensors were examined individually. The findings show that vibration occurs at relatively low levels during continuous motion because it mainly appears at component transition edges. Due to abrupt acceleration and deceleration during zigzag motion, vibration reaches its peak.

TL;DR: A framework for integrated sensing and multicast communication using pinching antennas, with optimized antenna placement for communications-centric, sensing-centric, and Pareto-optimal designs in single and multi-antenna scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an integrated sensing and multicast communication system that optimizes antenna placement to balance communication performance (multicast rate with max-min fairness) and sensing performance (quantified by Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound).

Method: Proposes pinching antennas-aided framework with three optimization criteria: communications-centric, sensing-centric, and Pareto-optimal designs. For single-PA case, derives closed-form solutions and geometric insights. For multi-PA case, uses element-wise alternating optimization and augmented Lagrangian framework.

Result: PASS significantly outperforms fixed-antenna baselines in both multicast rate and sensing accuracy. Multicasting gain increases with user density, and sensing accuracy improves with more deployed PAs.

Conclusion: The proposed pinching antennas framework effectively integrates sensing and multicast communication, with optimized antenna placement providing substantial performance gains over conventional fixed-antenna systems.

Abstract: A pinching antennas (PAs)-aided integrated sensing and multicast communication framework is proposed. In this framework, the communication performance is measured by the multicast rate considering max-min fairness. Moreover, the sensing performance is quantified by the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB), where a Gauss-Hermite quadrature-based approach is proposed to compute the Bayesian Fisher information matrix. Based on these metrics, PA placement is optimized under three criteria: communications-centric (C-C), sensing-centric (S-C), and Pareto-optimal designs. These designs are investigated in two scenarios: the single-PA case and the multi-PA case. 1) For the single-PA case, a closed-form solution is derived for the location of the C-C transmit PA, while the S-C design yields optimal transmit and receive PA placements that are symmetric about the target location. Leveraging this geometric insight, the Pareto-optimal design is solved by enforcing this PA placement symmetry, thereby reducing the joint transmit and receive PA placement to the transmit PA optimization. 2) For the general multi-PA case, the PA placements constitute a highly non-convex optimization problem. To solve this, an element-wise alternating optimization-based method is proposed to sequentially optimize all PA placements for the S-C design, and is further incorporated into an augmented Lagrangian (AL) framework and a rate-profile formulation to solve the C-C and Pareto-optimal design problems, respectively. Numerical results show that: i) PASS substantially outperforms fixed-antenna baselines in both multicast rate and sensing accuracy; ii) the multicasting gain becomes more pronounced as the user density increases; and iii) the sensing accuracy improves with the number of deployed PAs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large-scale GNSS spoofing activity can be detected using maritime AIS position reports, providing a scalable monitoring approach for identifying potential spoofing events.

Method: Developed SeaSpoofFinder framework with two-stage detection: Stage 1 identifies implausible position jumps using kinematic and data-quality filters; Stage 2 retains events only when multiple vessels show spatially consistent source and target clustering to reduce false positives.

Result: Detected recurrent spoofing patterns in Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Murmansk, Moscow, and Haifa area with large affected footprints; also identified recurring non-spoofing artifacts that can pass heuristic filters in dense traffic.

Conclusion: AIS-based monitoring provides useful evidence for identifying potential spoofing at scale, but AIS-only evidence cannot provide definitive attribution of spoofing activity.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether large-scale GNSS spoofing activity can be inferred from maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS) position reports. A data-processing framework, called SeaSpoofFinder, available here: seaspooffinder.github.io/ais_data, was developed to ingest and post-process global AIS streams and to detect candidate anomalies through a two-stage procedure. In Stage 1, implausible position jumps are identified using kinematic and data-quality filters; in Stage 2, events are retained only when multiple vessels exhibit spatially consistent source and target clustering, thereby reducing false positives from single-vessel artifacts. The resulting final potential spoofing events (FPSEs) reveal recurrent patterns in several regions, including the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, Murmansk, Moscow, and the Haifa area, with affected footprints that can span large maritime areas. The analysis also highlights recurring non-spoofing artifacts (e.g., back-to-port jumps and data gaps) that can still pass heuristic filters in dense traffic regions. These results indicate that AIS-based monitoring can provide useful evidence for identifying and characterizing potential spoofing activity at scale, while emphasizing that AIS-only evidence does not provide definitive attribution.

Formulates optimization problem for beamforming vectors, STAR-RIS transmission/reflection coefficients, and metasurface partition between energy-splitting and transmit-only modes. Uses fractional programming, Lagrangian dual reformulation, successive convex approximation, and projection-based binarization.

Result: Numerical results show the proposed design achieves effective trade-off between sensing accuracy and communication throughput, significantly outperforming conventional STAR-RIS-aided ISAC schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed STAR-RIS assisted ISAC system with two-stage protocol and optimization framework successfully balances sensing and communication performance, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches through effective joint optimization of system parameters.

Abstract: This paper investigates the design of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems assisted by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs), which act as multi-functional programmable metasurfaces capable of supporting concurrent communication and sensing within a unified architecture. We propose a two-stage ISAC protocol, in which the preparation phase performs direction estimation for outdoor users located in the reflection space, while maintaining communication with both outdoor and indoor users in the transmission space. The subsequent communication phase exploits the estimated directions to enhance information transfer. The directions of outdoor users are modeled as Gaussian random variables to capture estimation uncertainty, and the corresponding average communication performance is incorporated into the design. Building on this framework, we formulate a performance-balanced optimization problem that maximizes the communication sum-rate while guaranteeing the required sensing accuracy, jointly determining the beamforming vectors at the base station (BS), the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficients, and the metasurface partition between energy-splitting and transmit-only modes. The physical constraints of STAR-RIS elements and the required sensing performance are explicitly enforced. To address the non-convex nature of the problem, we combine fractional programming, Lagrangian dual reformulation, and successive convex approximation. The binary metasurface partition is ultimately recovered via continuous relaxation followed by projection-based binarization. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design achieves an effective trade-off between sensing accuracy and communication throughput, by significantly outperforming conventional STAR-RIS-aided ISAC schemes.

TL;DR: Proposed a modulo sampling reconstruction algorithm that directly estimates residual signals to avoid error propagation, outperforming conventional difference-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional modulo sampling methods reconstruct signals by estimating differences of residual signals, causing estimation errors to propagate through subsequent time samples. This error-propagation problem needs to be eliminated for more accurate signal reconstruction.

Method: Proposed algorithm reconstructs the residual signal directly rather than estimating differences. It leverages high-frequency characteristics of modulo samples and the sparsity of both the residual signal and its difference.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed method reconstructs the original signal more accurately than conventional methods based on differences of the residual signal.

Conclusion: Direct reconstruction of residual signals in modulo sampling eliminates error propagation and provides more accurate signal recovery compared to conventional difference-based approaches.

Abstract: Modulo sampling is a promising technology to preserve amplitude information that exceeds the observable range of analog-to-digital converters during the digitization of analog signals. Since conventional methods typically reconstruct the original signal by estimating the differences of the residual signal and computing their cumulative sum, each estimation error inevitably propagates through subsequent time samples. In this paper, to eliminate this error-propagation problem, we propose an algorithm that reconstructs the residual signal directly. The proposed method takes advantage of the high-frequency characteristics of the modulo samples and the sparsity of both the residual signal and its difference. Simulation results show that the proposed method reconstructs the original signal more accurately than a conventional method based on the differences of the residual signal.

Motivation: While time and frequency synchronization are well-established in MIMO systems, maintaining real-time phase coherence remains an open requirement crucial for beamforming and precise parameter estimation (AoA/AoD).

Method: Presents and validates a simple local real-time phase calibration method for digital arrays, comparing two approaches: instantaneous and smoothed calibration to determine optimal synchronization intervals.

Result: Both calibration approaches are effective, yielding RMS jitter in the range of 2.1 ps to 124 fs across different SDR models, enabling coherent transmission on commonly available SDR platforms.

Conclusion: The method enables investigation of advanced MIMO techniques and transmit beamforming in practical testbeds by providing precise phase coherence on affordable SDR platforms.

Abstract: Channel measurements in MIMO systems hinge on precise synchronization. While methods for time and frequency synchronization are well established, maintaining real-time phase coherence remains an open requirement for many MIMO systems. Phase coherence in MIMO systems is crucial for beamforming in digital arrays and enables precise parameter estimates such as Angle-of-Arrival/Departure. This work presents and validates a simple local real-time phase calibration method for a digital array. We compare two different approaches, instantaneous and smoothed calibration, to determine the optimal interval between synchronization procedures. To quantitatively assess calibration performance, we use two metrics: the average beamforming power loss and the RMS cycle-to-cycle jitter. Our results indicate that both approaches for phase calibration are effective and yield RMS of jitter in the 2.1 ps to 124 fs range for different SDR models. This level of precision enables coherent transmission on commonly available SDR platforms, allowing investigation on advanced MIMO techniques and transmit beamforming in practical testbeds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve hardware resilience in cell-free massive MIMO networks by addressing AP failures, which can degrade network performance and leave users without service.

Method: Failure-Aware Access Point Selection (FAAS) method that selects APs for each user by jointly considering channel strength and failure probability of each AP, with tunable parameter α to scale failure probabilities for different network stress levels.

Result: FAAS maintains significantly better performance under failure conditions compared to failure-agnostic clustering, reducing outage by over 85% at high failure levels and improving worst-case user rates.

Conclusion: FAAS is a practical and efficient solution for building more reliable cell-free massive MIMO networks by proactively addressing hardware failures through intelligent AP selection.

Abstract: This paper presents a Failure-Aware Access Point Selection (FAAS) method aimed at improving hardware resilience in cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) networks. FAAS selects APs for each user by jointly considering channel strength and the failure probability of each AP. A tunable parameter \(α\in [0,1]\) scales these failure probabilities to model different levels of network stress. We evaluate resilience using two key metrics: the minimum-user spectral efficiency, which captures worst-case user performance, and the outage probability, defined as the fraction of users left without any active APs. Simulation results show that FAAS maintains significantly better performance under failure conditions compared to failure-agnostic clustering. At high failure levels, FAAS reduces outage by over 85\% and improves worst-case user rates.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: WindDensity-MBIR: A Bayesian model-based iterative reconstruction method for 3D density field measurement in wind tunnels using sparse-view wavefront tomography, achieving 10-25% error even with limited data and removed wavefront components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wind tunnel imaging techniques lack non-invasive 3D density measurement capabilities for aerodynamic turbulence. Existing wavefront tomography methods make strong assumptions to handle ill-conditioned problems, limiting their practical application.

Method: Formulates the problem as Bayesian sparse-view tomographic reconstruction and develops a model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm (WindDensity-MBIR) that uses multiple wavefront measurements from various viewing angles without requiring spline basis representations.

Result: The method successfully recovers high-order features in challenging scenarios with sparse data, small projection field of view, and limited angular extent, achieving reconstruction errors within 10% to 25% even when tip, tilt, and piston components are removed from wavefront measurements.

Conclusion: WindDensity-MBIR provides an effective solution for non-invasive 3D density field measurement in wind tunnels, overcoming limitations of existing methods and demonstrating robustness in difficult reconstruction scenarios with sparse and incomplete data.

Abstract: Experimentalists often use wind tunnels to study aerodynamic turbulence, but most wind tunnel imaging techniques are limited in their ability to take non-invasive 3D density measurements of turbulence. Wavefront tomography is a technique that uses multiple wavefront measurements from various viewing angles to non-invasively measure the 3D density field of a turbulent medium. Existing methods make strong assumptions, such as a spline basis representation, to address the ill-conditioned nature of this problem. We formulate this problem as a Bayesian, sparse-view tomographic reconstruction problem and develop a model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm for measuring the volumetric 3D density field inside a wind tunnel. We call this method WindDensity-MBIR and apply it using simulated data to difficult reconstruction scenarios with sparse data, small projection field of view, and limited angular extent. WindDensity-MBIR can recover high-order features in these scenarios within 10% to 25% error even when the tip, tilt, and piston are removed from the wavefront measurements.

### [111] [Active RIS-Assisted MIMO System for Vital Signs Extraction: ISAC Modeling, Deep Learning, and Prototype Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16637)
*De-Ming Chian,Chao-Kai Wen,Feng-Ji Chen,Yi-Jie Sun,Fu-Kang Wang*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: RIS-VSign system uses active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces to improve vital signs extraction in integrated sensing and communication scenarios, enabling reliable respiration detection and higher-order modulation simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of reliable vital signs extraction (particularly respiration rate) in integrated sensing and communication systems, where conventional approaches suffer from unreliable detection and limited modulation capabilities without RIS assistance.

Method: Two-stage system: 1) DMTNet deep learning framework with Difference of Möbius Transformation to mitigate synchronization-induced phase drifts and configure multiple active RIS elements, trained on simulated data; 2) Multi-antenna measurement fusion using DC-offset calibration and DeepMining-MMV processing with CA-CFAR detection and Newton's refinements.

Result: Active RIS deployment improves respiration detectability while simultaneously enabling higher-order modulation. Without RIS, respiration detection is unreliable and only lower-order modulation is supported. The phase selector trained on simulated data was successfully validated experimentally.

Conclusion: The RIS-VSign system demonstrates that active RIS-assisted MIMO-OFDM frameworks can effectively extract vital signs in ISAC scenarios, overcoming synchronization challenges and enabling both reliable sensing and enhanced communication capabilities.

Abstract: We present the RIS-VSign system, an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) framework for vital signs extraction under an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) model. The system consists of two stages: the phase selector of RIS and the extraction of respiration rate. To mitigate synchronization-induced common phase drifts, the difference of Möbius transformation (DMT) is integrated into the deep learning framework, named DMTNet, to jointly configure multiple active RIS elements. Notably, the training data are generated in simulation without collecting real-world measurements, and the resulting phase selector is validated experimentally. For sensing, multi-antenna measurements are fused by the DC-offset calibration and the DeepMining-MMV processing with CA-CFAR detection and Newton's refinements. Prototype experiments indicate that active RIS deployment improves respiration detectability while simultaneously enabling higher-order modulation; without RIS, respiration detection is unreliable and only lower-order modulation is supported.

*Harshdeep Singh,Anuj Kumar Bhagat,Ritumoni Sarma,Indivar Gupta*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: MTG codes are defined as subfield subcodes of duals of multi-twisted Reed-Solomon codes, with minimum distance ≥ t+1 under conditions. A decoding method corrects up to ⌊t/2⌋ errors, making them practical for Niederreiter PKC with security against partial key recovery and reduced public key size via quasi-cyclic construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend beyond single-twist Goppa codes limited to twist at last position, and to develop more flexible multi-twisted Goppa codes with practical decoding methods for cryptographic applications, particularly in the Niederreiter public key cryptosystem.

Method: Define MTG codes as subfield subcodes of duals of multi-twisted Reed-Solomon codes. Use extended Euclidean algorithm to decode MTG codes with single twist at any position. Construct quasi-cyclic MTG codes using non-trivial automorphism group to reduce public key size.

Result: Minimum distance of MTG codes is at least t+1 under certain conditions. Decoding method corrects up to ⌊t/2⌋ errors efficiently. Niederreiter PKC based on MTG codes is secure against partial key recovery attacks. Public key size is reduced through quasi-cyclic construction.

Conclusion: MTG codes provide a flexible generalization of Goppa codes with practical decoding capabilities, making them suitable for cryptographic applications in Niederreiter PKC with enhanced security and reduced key sizes.

Abstract: This article defines multi-twisted Goppa (MTG) codes as subfield subcodes of duals of multi-twisted Reed-Solomon (MTRS) codes and examines their properties. We show that if $t$ is the degree of the MTG polynomial defining an MTG code, its minimum distance is at least $t + 1$ under certain conditions. Extending earlier methods limited to single twist at last position, we use the extended Euclidean algorithm to efficiently decode MTG codes with a single twist at any position, correcting up to $\left\lfloor \tfrac{t}{2} \right\rfloor$ errors. This decoding method highlights the practical potential of these codes within the Niederreiter public key cryptosystem (PKC). Furthermore, we establish that the Niederreiter PKC based on MTG codes is secure against partial key recovery attacks. Additionally, we also reduce the public key size by constructing quasi-cyclic MTG codes using a non-trivial automorphism group.

TL;DR: A scalable Bayesian optimization framework for dense base-station configuration using block coordinate descent to overcome dimensionality issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian optimization struggles with high-dimensional problems in dense base-station deployment scenarios due to the curse of dimensionality, limiting its scalability for practical applications.

Method: The proposed method uses block coordinate descent to sequentially optimize per-BS parameters while fixing other configurations, reducing effective dimensionality at each optimization step.

Result: Numerical results show the proposed approach significantly outperforms naive optimization methods in dense deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: The block coordinate descent-based Bayesian optimization framework provides an effective solution for scalable dense base-station configuration design by mitigating dimensionality challenges.

Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable Bayesian optimization (BO) framework for dense base-station (BS) configuration design. BO can find an optimal BS configuration by iterating parameter search, channel simulation, and probabilistic modeling of the objective function. However, its performance is severely affected by the curse of dimensionality, thereby reducing its scalability. To overcome this limitation, the proposed method sequentially optimizes per-BS parameters based on block coordinate descent while fixing the remaining BS configurations, thereby reducing the effective dimensionality of each optimization step. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms naive optimization in dense deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: Extends DNA composite sequence codes to general alphabet size q with resolution k, establishing equivalence relations, deriving new upper bounds, and constructing near-optimal codes with efficient encoding/decoding algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work focused on binary (q=2) codes for ordered composite DNA sequences. This paper extends to general alphabet size q with resolution parameter k, addressing various composite error/deletion models that better represent DNA sequencing errors.

Method: 1) Establishes equivalence relations among composite-error and composite-deletion code families to reduce analysis complexity. 2) Derives novel upper bounds using refined sphere-packing and probabilistic methods. 3) Constructs near-optimal codes with systematic encoders for various error models, including explicit encoding/decoding algorithms.

Result: 1) Equivalence relations significantly reduce distinct error-parameter sets needing analysis. 2) New general upper bounds covering all parameter values (q, k, error patterns). 3) Constructed near-optimal codes with efficient encoders for multiple error models, including first explicit algorithms for binary (1,0,...,0)-CECC and extensions to general q.

Conclusion: The paper provides comprehensive theoretical framework and practical constructions for composite error-correcting codes beyond binary case, with general bounds and efficient implementations applicable to DNA sequencing error correction.

Abstract: This paper extends the foundational work of Dollma \emph{et al}. on codes for ordered composite DNA sequences. We consider the general setting with an alphabet of size $q$ and a resolution parameter $k$, moving beyond the binary ($q=2$) case primarily studied previously. We investigate error-correcting codes for substitution errors and deletion errors under several channel models, including $(e_1,\ldots,e_k)$-composite error/deletion, $e$-composite error/deletion, and the newly introduced $t$-$(e_1,\ldots,e_t)$-composite error/deletion model.
  We first establish equivalence relations among families of composite-error correcting codes (CECCs) and among families of composite-deletion correcting codes (CDCCs). This significantly reduces the number of distinct error-parameter sets that require separate analysis. We then derive novel and general upper bounds on the sizes of CECCs using refined sphere-packing arguments and probabilistic methods. These bounds together cover all values of parameters $q$, $k$, $(e_1,\ldots,e_k)$ and $e$. In contrast, previous bounds were only established for $q=2$ and limited choices of $k$, $(e_1,\ldots,e_k)$ and $e$. For CDCCs, we generalize a known non-asymptotic upper bound for $(1,0,\ldots,0)$-CDCCs and then provide a cleaner asymptotic bound.
  On the constructive side, for any $q\ge2$, we propose $(1,0,\ldots,0)$-CDCCs, $1$-CDCCs and $t$-$(1,\ldots,1)$-CDCCs with near-optimal redundancies. These codes have efficient and systematic encoders. For substitution errors, we design the first explicit encoding and decoding algorithms for the binary $(1,0,\ldots,0)$-CECC constructed by Dollma \emph{et al}, and extend the approach to general $q$. Furthermore, we give an improved construction of binary $1$-CECCs, a construction of nonbinary $1$-CECCs, and a construction of $t$-$(1,\ldots,1)$-CECCs. These constructions are also systematic.

*Masoud Kaveh,Farshad Rostami Ghadi,Riku Jantti,Kai-Kit Wong,F. Javier Lopez-Martinez*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: FAS-enabled reader with PSO optimization improves AmBC rates without explicit CSI, addressing double path loss and EH constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AmBC suffers from severe double path loss and multiplicative fading, while accurate CSI acquisition is challenging due to weak backscattered signals and resource-limited BDs.

Method: Use FAS-enabled reader with pixel-based antenna selection for spatial diversity without explicit CSI. Jointly optimize backscatter modulation coefficient under EH neutrality constraint using PSO-based framework with OTA approach.

Result: Proposed scheme significantly improves achievable rate compared to conventional single-antenna readers, with gains preserved under imperfect observations, stringent EH constraints, and different pixel spacings.

Conclusion: FAS-enabled readers with measurement-driven port selection and joint optimization effectively address AmBC challenges without requiring explicit CSI acquisition or multiple RF chains.

Abstract: Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables ultra-low-power connectivity by allowing passive backscatter devices (BDs) to convey information through reflection of ambient signals. However, the cascaded AmBC channel suffers from severe double path loss and multiplicative fading, while accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition is highly challenging due to the weak backscattered signal and the resource-limited nature of BDs. To address these challenges, this paper considers an AmBC system in which the reader is equipped with a pixel-based fluid antenna system (FAS). By dynamically selecting one antenna position from a dense set of pixels within a compact aperture, the FAS-enabled reader exploits spatial diversity through measurement-driven port selection, without requiring explicit CSI acquisition or multiple RF chains. The intrinsic rate-energy tradeoff at the BD is also incorporated by jointly optimizing the backscatter modulation coefficient under an energy harvesting (EH) neutrality constraint. To efficiently solve this problem, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based framework is developed to jointly determine the FAS port selection and modulation coefficient on an optimize-then-average (OTA) basis. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the achievable rate compared with conventional single-antenna readers, with gains preserved under imperfect observations, stringent EH constraints, and different pixel spacings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve uplink channel estimation in cell-free massive MIMO systems by leveraging continuous fluid antenna sampling rather than traditional discrete port-based architectures.

Method: Model wireless channel as spatially correlated Gaussian random field, formulate channel estimation as Gaussian process regression with motion-constrained spatial sampling, derive closed-form LMMSE estimator and error expressions.

Result: Continuous FA sampling achieves equal or lower estimation error than discrete architectures for any finite pilot budget, with strict improvement for non-degenerate spatial correlation models.

Conclusion: Continuous fluid antenna framework provides performance gains over discrete baselines for channel estimation in CF-mMIMO systems, validated by numerical results.

Abstract: In this letter, we develop a continuous fluid antenna (FA) framework for uplink channel estimation in cell-free massive multiple-input and multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems. By modeling the wireless channel as a spatially correlated Gaussian random field, channel estimation is formulated as a Gaussian process (GP) regression problem with motion-constrained spatial sampling. Closed-form expressions for the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator and the corresponding estimation error are derived. A fundamental comparison with discrete port-based architectures is established under identical position constraints, showing that continuous FA sampling achieves equal or lower estimation error for any finite pilot budget, with strict improvement for non-degenerate spatial correlation models. Numerical results validate the analysis and show the performance gains of continuous FA sampling over discrete baselines.

### [117] [Spectral Conditions for the Ingleton Inequality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16536)
*Rostislav Matveev,Andrei Romashchenko*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper shows that for random variables uniformly distributed on expander graphs, the Ingleton inequality holds approximately despite non-extractable mutual information, with violations bounded by spectral parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Ingleton inequality holds for representable matroids but fails for entropic vectors. Understanding the extent of its violation has been a longstanding problem in information theory, particularly whether strongly non-extractable mutual information leads to large violations.

Method: The authors consider pairs (X,Y) uniformly distributed on their joint support where the associated biregular bipartite graph is an expander. They use the expander mixing lemma combined with a partitioning technique for finite sets to analyze auxiliary random variables A and B jointly distributed with (X,Y).

Result: For all auxiliary random variables A and B, they establish a lower bound on the Ingleton quantity I(X:Y|A) + I(X:Y|B) + I(A:B) - I(X:Y) in terms of the spectral parameters of the underlying expander graph, showing only small additive violations.

Conclusion: Contrary to common intuition, strongly non-extractable mutual information does not lead to large violations of the Ingleton inequality in this setting. The Ingleton inequality holds approximately for random variables on expander graphs.

Abstract: The Ingleton inequality is a classical linear information inequality that holds for representable matroids but fails to be universally valid for entropic vectors. Understanding the extent to which this inequality can be violated has been a longstanding problem in information theory. In this paper, we show that for a broad class
  of jointly distributed random variables $(X,Y)$ the Ingleton inequality holds up to a small additive error, even even though the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ is far from being extractable. Contrary to common intuition, strongly non-extractable mutual information does not lead to large violations of the Ingleton inequality in this setting. More precisely, we consider pairs $(X,Y)$ that are uniformly distributed on their joint support and whose associated biregular bipartite graph is an expander. For all auxiliary random variables $A$ and $B$ jointly distributed with $(X,Y)$, we establish a lower bound on the Ingleton quantity $I(X:Y | A) + I(X:Y | B) + I(A:B) - I(X:Y)$ in terms of the spectral parameters of the underlying graph. Our proof combines the expander mixing lemma with a partitioning technique for finite sets.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: SPIR capacity analysis for graph-replicated databases with two common randomness distribution models: graph-replicated vs fully-replicated randomness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Study SPIR in graph-replicated database systems where messages are stored at exactly two servers connected by graph links, analyzing how different common randomness distributions affect capacity.

Method: Two settings: i) graph-replicated common randomness (randomness assigned per server pair sharing a message), ii) fully-replicated common randomness (identical randomness to all servers). Derive capacity lower bounds, show tightness for path/regular graphs, and construct SPIR schemes from PIR schemes.

Result: For setting i): general lower bound on SPIR capacity, tight for path/regular graphs, minimum common randomness size equals message size. For setting ii): capacity improves over setting i, demonstrated through capacity lower bounds for graph classes.

Conclusion: Different common randomness distributions significantly impact SPIR capacity in graph-replicated systems, with fully-replicated randomness providing better performance than graph-replicated randomness.

Abstract: In symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR), a user communicates with multiple servers to retrieve from them a message in a database, while not revealing the message index to any individual server (user privacy), and learning no additional information about the database (database privacy). We study the problem of SPIR on graph-replicated database systems, where each node of the graph represents a server and each link represents a message. Each message is replicated at exactly two servers; those at which the link representing the message is incident. To ensure database privacy, the servers share a set of common randomness, independent of the database and the user's desired message index. We study two cases of common randomness distribution to the servers: i) graph-replicated common randomness, and ii) fully-replicated common randomness. Given a graph-replicated database system, in i), we assign one randomness variable independently to every pair of servers sharing a message, while in ii), we assign an identical set of randomness variable to all servers, irrespective of the underlying graph. In both settings, our goal is to characterize the SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum number of desired message symbols retrieved per downloaded symbol, and quantify the minimum amount of common randomness required to achieve the capacity. To this goal, in setting i), we derive a general lower bound on the SPIR capacity, and show it to be tight for path and regular graphs through a matching converse. Moreover, we establish that the minimum size of common randomness required for SPIR is equal to the message size. In setting ii), the SPIR capacity improves over the first, more restrictive setting. We show this through capacity lower bounds for a class of graphs, by constructing SPIR schemes from PIR schemes.

TL;DR: CaR is a novel neural routing solver framework that uses explicit learning-based feasibility refinement to efficiently handle hard constraints, outperforming existing methods in feasibility, quality, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural solvers struggle with complex routing constraints - existing constraint-handling methods (feasibility masking or implicit awareness) are inefficient or inapplicable for hard constraints, limiting their practical application.

Method: Construct-and-Refine (CaR) framework with joint training that guides construction module to generate diverse, high-quality solutions suitable for lightweight improvement (10 steps vs 5k in prior work), plus construction-improvement-shared representation for knowledge sharing.

Result: CaR achieves superior feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency compared to both classical and neural state-of-the-art solvers on typical hard routing constraints.

Conclusion: CaR provides the first general and efficient constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers, enabling practical application to complex constrained routing problems through explicit learning-based feasibility refinement.

Abstract: Neural solvers have achieved impressive progress in addressing simple routing problems, particularly excelling in computational efficiency. However, their advantages under complex constraints remain nascent, for which current constraint-handling schemes via feasibility masking or implicit feasibility awareness can be inefficient or inapplicable for hard constraints. In this paper, we present Construct-and-Refine (CaR), the first general and efficient constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers based on explicit learning-based feasibility refinement. Unlike prior construction-search hybrids that target reducing optimality gaps through heavy improvements yet still struggle with hard constraints, CaR achieves efficient constraint handling by designing a joint training framework that guides the construction module to generate diverse and high-quality solutions well-suited for a lightweight improvement process, e.g., 10 steps versus 5k steps in prior work. Moreover, CaR presents the first use of construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling potential knowledge sharing across paradigms by unifying the encoder, especially in more complex constrained scenarios. We evaluate CaR on typical hard routing constraints to showcase its broader applicability. Results demonstrate that CaR achieves superior feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency compared to both classical and neural state-of-the-art solvers.

TL;DR: Autonomous prompt optimization can paradoxically degrade classifier performance, especially for low-prevalence classes, where systems can achieve high accuracy while detecting zero positive cases. Retrospective selection outperforms active intervention for stabilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agentic workflows that iteratively refine their behavior hold promise but have poorly characterized failure modes. The paper investigates optimization instability where continued autonomous improvement paradoxically degrades classifier performance.

Method: Used Pythia framework for automated prompt optimization on three clinical symptoms with varying prevalence (23%, 12%, 3%). Evaluated two interventions: guiding agent (active redirection) and selector agent (retrospective identification of best-performing iteration).

Result: Validation sensitivity oscillated between 1.0 and 0.0 across iterations, with severity inversely proportional to class prevalence. At 3% prevalence, system achieved 95% accuracy while detecting zero positive cases. Selector agent successfully prevented catastrophic failure and outperformed expert-curated lexicons by 331% (F1) for brain fog and 7% for chest pain.

Conclusion: Characterizes a critical failure mode of autonomous AI systems and demonstrates that retrospective selection outperforms active intervention for stabilization in low-prevalence classification tasks.

Abstract: Autonomous agentic workflows that iteratively refine their own behavior hold considerable promise, yet their failure modes remain poorly characterized. We investigate optimization instability, a phenomenon in which continued autonomous improvement paradoxically degrades classifier performance, using Pythia, an open-source framework for automated prompt optimization. Evaluating three clinical symptoms with varying prevalence (shortness of breath at 23%, chest pain at 12%, and Long COVID brain fog at 3%), we observed that validation sensitivity oscillated between 1.0 and 0.0 across iterations, with severity inversely proportional to class prevalence. At 3% prevalence, the system achieved 95% accuracy while detecting zero positive cases, a failure mode obscured by standard evaluation metrics. We evaluated two interventions: a guiding agent that actively redirected optimization, amplifying overfitting rather than correcting it, and a selector agent that retrospectively identified the best-performing iteration successfully prevented catastrophic failure. With selector agent oversight, the system outperformed expert-curated lexicons on brain fog detection by 331% (F1) and chest pain by 7%, despite requiring only a single natural language term as input. These findings characterize a critical failure mode of autonomous AI systems and demonstrate that retrospective selection outperforms active intervention for stabilization in low-prevalence classification tasks.

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks uncertainty quantification methods for LLM-based automatic assessment in education, analyzing how uncertainty affects grading reliability and downstream pedagogical decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs introduce output uncertainty in automatic assessment due to their probabilistic nature, which can lead to unreliable grading and potentially harmful downstream pedagogical interventions if not properly calibrated.

Method: Benchmarking a broad range of uncertainty quantification methods across multiple assessment datasets, LLM families, and generation control settings to characterize uncertainty patterns in grading scenarios.

Result: Comprehensive analysis reveals uncertainty patterns in LLM-based grading, evaluates strengths/limitations of different uncertainty metrics, and analyzes influence of model families, assessment tasks, and decoding strategies on uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable insights for developing more reliable uncertainty-aware grading systems and lays groundwork for future research in LLM-based educational assessment.

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) is reshaping the landscape of automatic assessment in education. While these systems demonstrate substantial advantages in adaptability to diverse question types and flexibility in output formats, they also introduce new challenges related to output uncertainty, stemming from the inherently probabilistic nature of LLMs. Output uncertainty is an inescapable challenge in automatic assessment, as assessment results often play a critical role in informing subsequent pedagogical actions, such as providing feedback to students or guiding instructional decisions. Unreliable or poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates can lead to unstable downstream interventions, potentially disrupting students' learning processes and resulting in unintended negative consequences. To systematically understand this challenge and inform future research, we benchmark a broad range of uncertainty quantification methods in the context of LLM-based automatic assessment. Although the effectiveness of these methods has been demonstrated in many tasks across other domains, their applicability and reliability in educational settings, particularly for automatic grading, remain underexplored. Through comprehensive analyses of uncertainty behaviors across multiple assessment datasets, LLM families, and generation control settings, we characterize the uncertainty patterns exhibited by LLMs in grading scenarios. Based on these findings, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of different uncertainty metrics and analyze the influence of key factors, including model families, assessment tasks, and decoding strategies, on uncertainty estimates. Our study provides actionable insights into the characteristics of uncertainty in LLM-based automatic assessment and lays the groundwork for developing more reliable and effective uncertainty-aware grading systems in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subspecialty clinical reasoning is challenging for LLMs due to rapidly evolving guidelines and nuanced evidence hierarchies, requiring specialized approaches beyond general medical knowledge.

Method: Evaluated Mirror against frontier LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Pro) on 120-question endocrinology board exam. Mirror used curated endocrinology/cardiometabolic evidence corpus with structured reasoning architecture under closed-evidence constraint, while comparator LLMs had real-time web access.

Top-2 accuracy was 92.5% vs 85.25% for GPT-5.2. 74.2% of Mirror outputs cited guideline-tier sources with 100% citation accuracy.

Conclusion: Curated evidence with explicit provenance outperforms unconstrained web retrieval for subspecialty clinical reasoning and supports auditability for clinical deployment through evidence traceability and citation accuracy.

Abstract: Background: Large language models have demonstrated strong performance on general medical examinations, but subspecialty clinical reasoning remains challenging due to rapidly evolving guidelines and nuanced evidence hierarchies. Methods: We evaluated January Mirror, an evidence-grounded clinical reasoning system, against frontier LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Pro) on a 120-question endocrinology board-style examination. Mirror integrates a curated endocrinology and cardiometabolic evidence corpus with a structured reasoning architecture to generate evidence-linked outputs. Mirror operated under a closed-evidence constraint without external retrieval. Comparator LLMs had real-time web access to guidelines and primary literature. Results: Mirror achieved 87.5% accuracy (105/120; 95% CI: 80.4-92.3%), exceeding a human reference of 62.3% and frontier LLMs including GPT-5.2 (74.6%), GPT-5 (74.0%), and Gemini-3-Pro (69.8%). On the 30 most difficult questions (human accuracy less than 50%), Mirror achieved 76.7% accuracy. Top-2 accuracy was 92.5% for Mirror versus 85.25% for GPT-5.2. Conclusions: Mirror provided evidence traceability: 74.2% of outputs cited at least one guideline-tier source, with 100% citation accuracy on manual verification. Curated evidence with explicit provenance can outperform unconstrained web retrieval for subspecialty clinical reasoning and supports auditability for clinical deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to train LLMs to learn interactively from corrective feedback, treating it as a trainable skill rather than emergent property, showing dramatic improvements in multi-turn performance and generalization across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM training relies on static corpora, overlooking interactive feedback loops essential for dynamic adaptation. Human learning excels at adapting based on corrective feedback, especially in collaborative settings, which current models lack.

Method: Proposes a scalable method transforming single-turn verifiable tasks into multi-turn didactic interactions with information asymmetry. Trains models to integrate corrective feedback, and further trains them to predict teacher critiques to enable self-correction.

Result: Models trained with this approach dramatically improve interactive learning from language feedback. Smaller models achieve near performance of models 10x larger. Shows robust OOD generalization: math training transfers to coding, puzzles, maze navigation. Enables self-correction without teacher.

Conclusion: Interactive in-context learning can be treated as a distinct, trainable skill. This paradigm offers unified path to self-improvement by converting external feedback into internal capability, enabling models to self-correct and adapt dynamically.

Abstract: Adapting one's thought process based on corrective feedback is an essential ability in human learning, particularly in collaborative settings. In contrast, the current large language model training paradigm relies heavily on modeling vast, static corpora. While effective for knowledge acquisition, it overlooks the interactive feedback loops essential for models to adapt dynamically to their context. In this work, we propose a framework that treats this interactive in-context learning ability not as an emergent property, but as a distinct, trainable skill. We introduce a scalable method that transforms single-turn verifiable tasks into multi-turn didactic interactions driven by information asymmetry. We first show that current flagship models struggle to integrate corrective feedback on hard reasoning tasks. We then demonstrate that models trained with our approach dramatically improve the ability to interactively learn from language feedback. More specifically, the multi-turn performance of a smaller model nearly reaches that of a model an order of magnitude larger. We also observe robust out-of-distribution generalization: interactive training on math problems transfers to diverse domains like coding, puzzles and maze navigation. Our qualitative analysis suggests that this improvement is due to an enhanced in-context plasticity. Finally, we show that this paradigm offers a unified path to self-improvement. By training the model to predict the teacher's critiques, effectively modeling the feedback environment, we convert this external signal into an internal capability, allowing the model to self-correct even without a teacher.

*Thinh Hung Truong,Jey Han Lau,Jianzhong Qi*

TL;DR: GPSBench is a comprehensive dataset for evaluating LLMs' geospatial reasoning capabilities across 17 tasks, revealing models struggle with geometric computations but perform better on real-world geographic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in physical-world applications (navigation, robotics, mapping), robust geospatial reasoning becomes critical, yet LLMs' ability to reason about GPS coordinates and real-world geography remains underexplored.

Method: Created GPSBench dataset with 57,800 samples across 17 tasks covering geometric coordinate operations (distance/bearing computation) and reasoning integrating coordinates with world knowledge. Evaluated 14 state-of-the-art LLMs focusing on intrinsic capabilities rather than tool use.

Result: GPS reasoning remains challenging with substantial task variation: models perform better at real-world geographic reasoning than geometric computations. Geographic knowledge degrades hierarchically (strong country-level, weak city-level). Coordinate noise robustness suggests genuine understanding rather than memorization. GPS-coordinate augmentation improves downstream tasks, while finetuning creates trade-offs between geometric computation gains and world knowledge degradation.

Conclusion: Geospatial reasoning is a critical but challenging capability for LLMs in physical-world applications. The GPSBench dataset enables systematic evaluation, revealing specific weaknesses and opportunities for improvement through targeted augmentation and finetuning approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in applications that interact with the physical world, such as navigation, robotics, or mapping, making robust geospatial reasoning a critical capability. Despite that, LLMs' ability to reason about GPS coordinates and real-world geography remains underexplored. We introduce GPSBench, a dataset of 57,800 samples across 17 tasks for evaluating geospatial reasoning in LLMs, spanning geometric coordinate operations (e.g., distance and bearing computation) and reasoning that integrates coordinates with world knowledge. Focusing on intrinsic model capabilities rather than tool use, we evaluate 14 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that GPS reasoning remains challenging, with substantial variation across tasks: models are generally more reliable at real-world geographic reasoning than at geometric computations. Geographic knowledge degrades hierarchically, with strong country-level performance but weak city-level localization, while robustness to coordinate noise suggests genuine coordinate understanding rather than memorization. We further show that GPS-coordinate augmentation can improve in downstream geospatial tasks, and that finetuning induces trade-offs between gains in geometric computation and degradation in world knowledge.

TL;DR: PAHF framework enables AI agents to continuously personalize to individual users' evolving preferences through explicit memory and dual feedback channels, outperforming static approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents fail to align with individual users' idiosyncratic and evolving preferences. Static approaches using implicit preference models or external memory struggle with new users and changing preferences over time.

Method: PAHF framework implements a three-step loop: 1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, 2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from explicit per-user memory, and 3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift.

Result: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts.

Conclusion: Integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical for effective continual personalization, allowing agents to learn from scratch and adapt to persona shifts in real-time interaction.

Abstract: Modern AI agents are powerful but often fail to align with the idiosyncratic, evolving preferences of individual users. Prior approaches typically rely on static datasets, either training implicit preference models on interaction history or encoding user profiles in external memory. However, these approaches struggle with new users and with preferences that change over time. We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts.

TL;DR: Training AI agents on high-fidelity enterprise simulation environments produces capabilities that generalize beyond training distribution, with CoreCraft showing significant improvement in task performance and transfer to out-of-distribution benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether training AI agents on high-fidelity reinforcement learning environments produces capabilities that generalize beyond the training distribution, particularly for complex enterprise tasks that require multi-step, domain-specific work.

Method: Introduced CoreCraft, a fully operational enterprise simulation of a customer support organization with over 2,500 entities across 14 entity types and 23 unique tools. Trained GLM 4.6 with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and adaptive clipping for one epoch.

Result: After training, task pass rate improved from 25.37% to 36.76% on held-out evaluation tasks. More importantly, gains transferred to out-of-distribution benchmarks: +4.5% on BFCL Parallel, +7.4% on τ²-Bench Retail, and +6.8% on Toolathlon (Pass@1).

Conclusion: Environment quality, diversity, and realism are key factors enabling generalizable agent capabilities. Task-centric world building, expert-authored rubrics, and realistic enterprise workflows contribute to observed transfer effects.

Abstract: We show that training AI agents on high-fidelity reinforcement learning environments produces capabilities that generalize beyond the training distribution. We introduce \corecraft{}, the first environment in \textsc{EnterpriseGym}, Surge AI's suite of agentic RL environments. \corecraft{} is a fully operational enterprise simulation of a customer support organization, comprising over 2,500 entities across 14 entity types with 23 unique tools, designed to measure whether AI agents can perform the multi-step, domain-specific work that real jobs demand. Frontier models such as GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6 solve fewer than 30\% of tasks when all expert-authored rubric criteria must be satisfied. Using this environment, we train GLM~4.6 with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and adaptive clipping. After a single epoch of training, the model improves from 25.37\% to 36.76\% task pass rate on held-out evaluation tasks. More importantly, these gains transfer to out-of-distribution benchmarks: +4.5\% on BFCL Parallel, +7.4\% on $τ^2$-Bench Retail, and +6.8\% on Toolathlon (Pass@1). We believe three environment properties are consistent with the observed transfer: task-centric world building that optimizes for diverse, challenging tasks; expert-authored rubrics enabling reliable reward computation; and enterprise workflows that reflect realistic professional patterns. Our results suggest that environment quality, diversity, and realism are key factors enabling generalizable agent capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper proposes alternative memory approaches for ASI beyond the dominant "extract then store" paradigm, emphasizing "store then on-demand extract" to avoid information loss, plus probabilistic experience analysis and experience sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI memory systems follow an "extract then store" approach that risks losing valuable information during extraction. The authors aim to explore alternative memory design concepts essential for achieving artificial superintelligence, focusing on approaches that preserve more information and enable more flexible application to various tasks.

Method: The paper focuses on conceptual exploration rather than novel methods, examining several alternative approaches: 1) "store then on-demand extract" (retaining raw experiences for flexible application), 2) discovering deeper insights from probabilistic experiences, and 3) improving experience collection efficiency through sharing. Simple experiments validate these approaches.

Result: Simple experiments demonstrate that the proposed alternative memory approaches are indeed effective, though the paper doesn't specify detailed experimental results. The approaches show promise for avoiding information loss and enabling more flexible task application compared to the dominant paradigm.

Conclusion: The paper identifies major challenges that have limited investigation into these promising memory directions and proposes research topics to address them. The alternative approaches offer potential benefits for achieving artificial superintelligence by preserving more information and enabling more flexible learning from experiences.

Abstract: Driven by our mission of "uplifting the world with memory," this paper explores the design concept of "memory" that is essential for achieving artificial superintelligence (ASI). Rather than proposing novel methods, we focus on several alternative approaches whose potential benefits are widely imaginable, yet have remained largely unexplored. The currently dominant paradigm, which can be termed "extract then store," involves extracting information judged to be useful from experiences and saving only the extracted content. However, this approach inherently risks the loss of information, as some valuable knowledge particularly for different tasks may be discarded in the extraction process. In contrast, we emphasize the "store then on-demand extract" approach, which seeks to retain raw experiences and flexibly apply them to various tasks as needed, thus avoiding such information loss. In addition, we highlight two further approaches: discovering deeper insights from large collections of probabilistic experiences, and improving experience collection efficiency by sharing stored experiences. While these approaches seem intuitively effective, our simple experiments demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Finally, we discuss major challenges that have limited investigation into these promising directions and propose research topics to address them.

TL;DR: Proxy State-Based Evaluation: An LLM-driven simulation framework for evaluating interactive LLM agents without deterministic backends, using proxy states inferred from interaction traces and LLM judges to verify goal completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent benchmarks require costly deterministic backends that are hard to build and iterate. Need scalable evaluation method for industrial LLM agents that can both compare models and generate on-policy training data.

Method: Scenario specification (user goal, facts, expected state/behavior) + LLM state tracker infers structured proxy state from interaction trace + LLM judges verify goal completion and detect hallucinations against constraints.

Result: Produces stable model-differentiating rankings across model families and reasoning efforts; on-/off-policy rollouts provide transferable supervision; near-zero simulator hallucination rates; 90%+ human-LLM judge agreement.

Conclusion: Proxy state-based evaluation offers practical, scalable alternative to deterministic benchmarks for industrial LLM agents, enabling reliable automated evaluation without costly deterministic backends.

Abstract: Interactive large language model (LLM) agents operating via multi-turn dialogue and multi-step tool calling are increasingly used in production. Benchmarks for these agents must both reliably compare models and yield on-policy training data. Prior agentic benchmarks (e.g., tau-bench, tau2-bench, AppWorld) rely on fully deterministic backends, which are costly to build and iterate. We propose Proxy State-Based Evaluation, an LLM-driven simulation framework that preserves final state-based evaluation without a deterministic database. Specifically, a scenario specifies the user goal, user/system facts, expected final state, and expected agent behavior, and an LLM state tracker infers a structured proxy state from the full interaction trace. LLM judges then verify goal completion and detect tool/user hallucinations against scenario constraints. Empirically, our benchmark produces stable, model-differentiating rankings across families and inference-time reasoning efforts, and its on-/off-policy rollouts provide supervision that transfers to unseen scenarios. Careful scenario specification yields near-zero simulator hallucination rates as supported by ablation studies. The framework also supports sensitivity analyses over user personas. Human-LLM judge agreement exceeds 90%, indicating reliable automated evaluation. Overall, proxy state-based evaluation offers a practical, scalable alternative to deterministic agentic benchmarks for industrial LLM agents.

TL;DR: Sequence models trained against diverse co-players develop in-context learning capabilities that naturally lead to cooperative behaviors without hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for inducing cooperation in multi-agent reinforcement learning rely on hardcoded assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce strict separation between naive learners and meta-learners, which limits scalability and flexibility.

Method: Train sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players, allowing them to develop in-context best-response strategies that function as learning algorithms on fast intra-episode timescales without explicit timescale separation.

Result: Sequence models naturally develop in-context adaptation that makes them vulnerable to extortion, and mutual pressure to shape opponents' in-context learning dynamics resolves into cooperative behavior, replicating mechanisms from prior work but emerging naturally.

Conclusion: Standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation.

Abstract: Achieving cooperation among self-interested agents remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between "learning-aware" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between "naive learners" updating on fast timescales and "meta-learners" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors.

TL;DR: A certification protocol for multiagent AI systems that verifies shared understanding of terms using statistical testing on observable events, reducing disagreement by 51-96%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiagent AI systems need consistent communication but lack methods to verify that agents share the same understanding of terms. Natural language is interpretable but vulnerable to semantic drift, while learned protocols are efficient but opaque.

Method: Proposes a certification protocol based on stimulus-meaning model where agents are tested on shared observable events. Terms are certified if empirical disagreement falls below a statistical threshold. Introduces core-guarded reasoning (agents restrict reasoning to certified terms) and mechanisms for detecting drift (recertification) and recovering shared vocabulary (renegotiation).

Result: In simulations with varying semantic divergence, core-guarding reduces disagreement by 72-96%. In validation with fine-tuned language models, disagreement is reduced by 51%.

Conclusion: The framework provides a first step towards verifiable agent-to-agent communication by ensuring shared understanding of terms through statistical certification and guarded reasoning.

Abstract: Multiagent AI systems require consistent communication, but we lack methods to verify that agents share the same understanding of the terms used. Natural language is interpretable but vulnerable to semantic drift, while learned protocols are efficient but opaque. We propose a certification protocol based on the stimulus-meaning model, where agents are tested on shared observable events and terms are certified if empirical disagreement falls below a statistical threshold. In this protocol, agents restricting their reasoning to certified terms ("core-guarded reasoning") achieve provably bounded disagreement. We also outline mechanisms for detecting drift (recertification) and recovering shared vocabulary (renegotiation). In simulations with varying degrees of semantic divergence, core-guarding reduces disagreement by 72-96%. In a validation with fine-tuned language models, disagreement is reduced by 51%. Our framework provides a first step towards verifiable agent-to-agent communication.

*Arun Vignesh Malarkkan,Wangyang Ying,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAFE is a causal reinforcement learning framework for automated feature engineering that uses causal discovery to guide feature construction, improving robustness to distribution shifts and reducing performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated feature engineering methods rely on statistical heuristics, producing brittle features that fail under distribution shifts. There's a need for more robust AFE approaches that can maintain performance when data distributions change.

Method: Two-phase approach: Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features by their causal influence. Phase II uses cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning to select causal groups and transformation operators with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies.

Result: Across 15 benchmarks, CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under covariate shifts, it reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to non-causal baseline and produces more compact feature sets with stable attributions.

Conclusion: Causal structure used as a soft inductive prior rather than rigid constraint can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering, making AFE systems more reliable under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Automated feature engineering (AFE) enables AI systems to autonomously construct high-utility representations from raw tabular data. However, existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, yielding brittle features that fail under distribution shift. We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery requires expert knowledge but many statistical methods lack principled ways to combine data with expertise. Causal ABA offers symbolic reasoning but needs expert input. LLMs can serve as imperfect experts to provide semantic structural priors.

Method: Use LLMs to elicit semantic structural priors from variable names and descriptions, then integrate these with conditional-independence evidence within the Causal Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) framework for causal discovery.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and semantically grounded synthetic graphs. Also introduced evaluation protocol to mitigate memorisation bias when assessing LLMs for causal discovery.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively serve as imperfect experts in Causal ABA framework, combining semantic priors with statistical evidence to achieve improved causal discovery while addressing memorisation bias concerns through proper evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Causal discovery seeks to uncover causal relations from data, typically represented as causal graphs, and is essential for predicting the effects of interventions. While expert knowledge is required to construct principled causal graphs, many statistical methods have been proposed to leverage observational data with varying formal guarantees. Causal Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) is a framework that uses symbolic reasoning to ensure correspondence between input constraints and output graphs, while offering a principled way to combine data and expertise. We explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as imperfect experts for Causal ABA, eliciting semantic structural priors from variable names and descriptions and integrating them with conditional-independence evidence. Experiments on standard benchmarks and semantically grounded synthetic graphs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and we additionally introduce an evaluation protocol to mitigate memorisation bias when assessing LLMs for causal discovery.

Motivation: Existing prompting schemes (Chain/Tree/Graph of Thoughts) have limitations: they use static, problem-specific reasoning structures that lack adaptability to dynamic or unseen problems, and they're under-optimized in hyperparameters, prompts, runtime, and cost.

Method: Introduce Framework of Thoughts (FoT) - a general-purpose foundation framework for building and optimizing dynamic reasoning schemes. FoT includes built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching.

Result: Implemented three popular schemes (Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, ProbTree) within FoT. Empirical results show FoT enables significantly faster execution, reduces costs, and achieves better task scores through optimization.

Conclusion: FoT unlocks latent performance potential of reasoning schemes and facilitates development of future dynamic and efficient reasoning schemes. Codebase released to support further research.

Abstract: Prompting schemes such as Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, and Graph of Thoughts can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, most existing schemes require users to define static, problem-specific reasoning structures that lack adaptability to dynamic or unseen problem types. Additionally, these schemes are often under-optimized in terms of hyperparameters, prompts, runtime, and prompting cost. To address these limitations, we introduce Framework of Thoughts (FoT)--a general-purpose foundation framework for building and optimizing dynamic reasoning schemes. FoT comes with built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching, unlocking the latent performance potential of reasoning schemes. We demonstrate FoT's capabilities by implementing three popular schemes--Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, and ProbTree--within FoT. We empirically show that FoT enables significantly faster execution, reduces costs, and achieves better task scores through optimization. We release our codebase to facilitate the development of future dynamic and efficient reasoning schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether machines can create good poetry and examine the fundamental questions this raises about the nature and value of art, creativity, and authorship.

Method: Conducted a seven-month poetry workshop using iterative in-context expert feedback to shape a large language model into a digital poet without retraining. Used quantitative and qualitative analyses to track development, and conducted a blinded authorship test with 50 humanities students/graduates comparing AI poems with poems by well-known poets.

Result: The model developed a distinctive style and coherent corpus, created a pen name and author image. In blinded tests, human poems were labeled human 54% of the time and AI poems 52% of the time (95% confidence intervals including 50%, indicating chance-level performance). A commercial publisher released a poetry collection authored by the model.

Conclusion: Workshop-style prompting can support long-horizon creative shaping of AI systems, and the results renew debates on creativity and authorship by demonstrating that AI-generated poetry can be indistinguishable from human poetry.

Abstract: Can a machine write good poetry? Any positive answer raises fundamental questions about the nature and value of art. We report a seven-month poetry workshop in which a large language model was shaped into a digital poet through iterative in-context expert feedback, without retraining. Across sessions, the model developed a distinctive style and a coherent corpus, supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses, and it produced a pen name and author image. In a blinded authorship test with 50 humanities students and graduates (three AI poems and three poems by well-known poets each), judgments were at chance: human poems were labeled human 54% of the time and AI poems 52%, with 95% confidence intervals including 50%. After the workshop, a commercial publisher released a poetry collection authored by the model. These results show that workshop-style prompting can support long-horizon creative shaping and renew debates on creativity and authorship.

TL;DR: Agent Skill framework improves small language models (SLMs) performance, especially for 12B-30B parameter models, making them viable alternatives to proprietary models in data-sensitive industrial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates whether Agent Skill framework benefits small language models (SLMs) similarly to proprietary models, addressing industrial needs where public APIs are infeasible due to data-security and budget constraints, and where SLMs show limited generalization in customized scenarios.

Method: Introduces formal mathematical definition of Agent Skill process, followed by systematic evaluation of language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases including two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims dataset.

Result: Tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs (12B-30B parameters) benefit substantially from Agent Skill approach. Code-specialized variants at ~80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency.

Conclusion: The findings provide comprehensive characterization of Agent Skill framework capabilities/constraints and actionable insights for effective deployment in SLM-centered environments, demonstrating viability of SLMs with Agent Skills for industrial applications with data-security requirements.

Abstract: Agent Skill framework, now widely and officially supported by major players such as GitHub Copilot, LangChain, and OpenAI, performs especially well with proprietary models by improving context engineering, reducing hallucinations, and boosting task accuracy. Based on these observations, an investigation is conducted to determine whether the Agent Skill paradigm provides similar benefits to small language models (SLMs). This question matters in industrial scenarios where continuous reliance on public APIs is infeasible due to data-security and budget constraints requirements, and where SLMs often show limited generalization in highly customized scenarios. This work introduces a formal mathematical definition of the Agent Skill process, followed by a systematic evaluation of language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases. The evaluation encompasses two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims data set. The results show that tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs (approximately 12B - 30B) parameters) benefit substantially from the Agent Skill approach. Moreover, code-specialized variants at around 80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive and nuanced characterization of the capabilities and constraints of the framework, while providing actionable insights for the effective deployment of Agent Skills in SLM-centered environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes 12 metrics across 4 dimensions (consistency, robustness, predictability, safety) to evaluate AI agent reliability beyond traditional success rates, revealing that recent capability gains haven't significantly improved reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agent evaluations focus on single success metrics that obscure critical operational flaws, creating a discrepancy between benchmark performance and real-world failures. Traditional metrics ignore important reliability aspects like consistency across runs, resilience to perturbations, predictable failure modes, and error severity bounds.

Method: The authors propose a holistic performance profile with 12 concrete metrics organized into four key dimensions: consistency (behavior across runs), robustness (withstanding perturbations), predictability (failure patterns), and safety (error severity). They evaluate 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks using this framework.

Result: Evaluation of 14 agentic models shows that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. The metrics expose persistent limitations that traditional success metrics miss, revealing how agents perform, degrade, and fail in practice.

Conclusion: The proposed reliability metrics complement traditional evaluations by providing tools for reasoning about agent performance degradation and failure modes. This holistic approach addresses the fundamental limitation of single-metric evaluations and offers a more comprehensive understanding of agent reliability for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed to execute important tasks. While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail.

*Rohit Kaushik,Eva Kaushik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework combining nonlinear dynamics, perceptual psychophysics, and high-frequency haptic rendering for realistic surgical simulation with low latency, high accuracy, and improved perceptual discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance realism in surgical simulation by addressing limitations in conventional haptic rendering methods, particularly the need to handle nonlinear tissue dynamics while accounting for human perceptual limits.

Method: 1) Uses Koopman operator formulation to linearize nonlinear tissue dynamics in an augmented state space; 2) Implements Bayesian calibration based on Weber-Fechner and Stevens scaling laws to adapt force rendering to individual perceptual thresholds; 3) Combines these approaches for high-frequency haptic rendering in surgical tasks.

Result: Achieves 4.3 ms average rendering latency, less than 2.8% force error, and 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination. Statistical analyses show significantly better performance than conventional spring-damper and energy-based rendering methods.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances surgical simulation realism by integrating nonlinear dynamics modeling with perceptual psychophysics. It has potential impact on surgical training and VR medical education, with future work aimed at closed-loop neural feedback in haptic interfaces.

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that combines nonlinear dynamics, perceptual psychophysics and high frequency haptic rendering to enhance realism in surgical simulation. The interaction of the surgical device with soft tissue is elevated to an augmented state space with a Koopman operator formulation, allowing linear prediction and control of the dynamics that are nonlinear by nature. To make the rendered forces consistent with human perceptual limits, we put forward a Bayesian calibration module based on WeberFechner and Stevens scaling laws, which progressively shape force signals relative to each individual's discrimination thresholds. For various simulated surgical tasks such as palpation, incision, and bone milling, the proposed system attains an average rendering latency of 4.3 ms, a force error of less than 2.8% and a 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination. Multivariate statistical analyses (MANOVA and regression) reveal that the system's performance is significantly better than that of conventional spring-damper and energy, based rendering methods. We end by discussing the potential impact on surgical training and VR, based medical education, as well as sketching future work toward closed, loop neural feedback in haptic interfaces.

### [138] [Memes-as-Replies: Can Models Select Humorous Manga Panel Responses?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15842)
*Ryosuke Kohita,Seiichiro Yoshioka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MaMe-Re, a benchmark for meme reply selection using Japanese manga panels, showing LLMs can capture social cues like exaggeration but struggle with contextual humor and visual understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational research focuses on analyzing intrinsic properties of memes but neglects the dynamic, contextual use of memes to create humor in conversations. There's a gap in understanding how memes function as interactive replies in social interactions.

Method: Introduced the Meme Reply Selection task and created MaMe-Re benchmark with 100,000 human-annotated pairs (500,000 total annotations from 2,325 annotators) using openly licensed Japanese manga panels and social media posts.

Result: Three key findings: (1) LLMs show preliminary ability to capture complex social cues like exaggeration; (2) Visual information doesn't improve performance, revealing a gap in using visual content for humor; (3) LLMs match human judgments in controlled settings but struggle with subtle wit distinctions among similar candidates.

Conclusion: Selecting contextually humorous replies remains an open challenge for current models, highlighting limitations in AI's understanding of contextual humor despite progress in semantic matching.

Abstract: Memes are a popular element of modern web communication, used not only as static artifacts but also as interactive replies within conversations. While computational research has focused on analyzing the intrinsic properties of memes, the dynamic and contextual use of memes to create humor remains an understudied area of web science. To address this gap, we introduce the Meme Reply Selection task and present MaMe-Re (Manga Meme Reply Benchmark), a benchmark of 100,000 human-annotated pairs (500,000 total annotations from 2,325 unique annotators) consisting of openly licensed Japanese manga panels and social media posts. Our analysis reveals three key insights: (1) large language models (LLMs) show preliminary evidence of capturing complex social cues such as exaggeration, moving beyond surface-level semantic matching; (2) the inclusion of visual information does not improve performance, revealing a gap between understanding visual content and effectively using it for contextual humor; (3) while LLMs can match human judgments in controlled settings, they struggle to distinguish subtle differences in wit among semantically similar candidates. These findings suggest that selecting contextually humorous replies remains an open challenge for current models.

### [139] [Kalman-Inspired Runtime Stability and Recovery in Hybrid Reasoning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15855)
*Barak Or*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Paper proposes a runtime stability framework for hybrid reasoning systems, modeling reasoning as stochastic inference with cognitive drift, and introducing monitoring/recovery mechanisms for reliable operation under uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid reasoning systems combining learned components with model-based inference are increasingly used in tool-augmented decision loops, but their runtime behavior under partial observability and evidence mismatch is poorly understood. Failures often emerge as gradual divergence of internal reasoning dynamics rather than isolated prediction errors.

Method: Models reasoning as a stochastic inference process driven by internal innovation signal, introduces cognitive drift as measurable runtime phenomenon. Proposes runtime stability framework that monitors innovation statistics, detects emerging instability, and triggers recovery-aware control mechanisms.

Result: Experiments on multi-step, tool-augmented reasoning tasks demonstrate reliable instability detection prior to task failure and show that recovery, when feasible, re-establishes bounded internal behavior within finite time.

Conclusion: Runtime stability should be considered as a system-level requirement for reliable reasoning under uncertainty, emphasizing the importance of monitoring internal reasoning dynamics rather than just task-level correctness.

Abstract: Hybrid reasoning systems that combine learned components with model-based inference are increasingly deployed in tool-augmented decision loops, yet their runtime behavior under partial observability and sustained evidence mismatch remains poorly understood. In practice, failures often arise as gradual divergence of internal reasoning dynamics rather than as isolated prediction errors. This work studies runtime stability in hybrid reasoning systems from a Kalman-inspired perspective. We model reasoning as a stochastic inference process driven by an internal innovation signal and introduce cognitive drift as a measurable runtime phenomenon. Stability is defined in terms of detectability, bounded divergence, and recoverability rather than task-level correctness. We propose a runtime stability framework that monitors innovation statistics, detects emerging instability, and triggers recovery-aware control mechanisms. Experiments on multi-step, tool-augmented reasoning tasks demonstrate reliable instability detection prior to task failure and show that recovery, when feasible, re-establishes bounded internal behavior within finite time. These results emphasize runtime stability as a system-level requirement for reliable reasoning under uncertainty.

*Kaaustaaub Shankar,Kelly Cohen*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually configuring GAM structure is challenging; need automated approach to balance predictive accuracy and interpretability.

Method: Multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II to optimize GAMs, minimizing both prediction error (RMSE) and a Complexity Penalty capturing sparsity, smoothness, and uncertainty.

Result: NSGA-II discovers GAMs that outperform baseline LinearGAMs in accuracy or match performance with substantially lower complexity on California Housing dataset.

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) balance predictive accuracy and interpretability, but manually configuring their structure is challenging. We propose using the multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II to automatically optimize GAMs, jointly minimizing prediction error (RMSE) and a Complexity Penalty that captures sparsity, smoothness, and uncertainty. Experiments on the California Housing dataset show that NSGA-II discovers GAMs that outperform baseline LinearGAMs in accuracy or match performance with substantially lower complexity. The resulting models are simpler, smoother, and exhibit narrower confidence intervals, enhancing interpretability. This framework provides a general approach for automated optimization of transparent, high-performing models. The code can be found at https://github.com/KaaustaaubShankar/GeneticAdditiveModels.

### [141] [IT-OSE: Exploring Optimal Sample Size for Industrial Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15878)
*Mingchun Sun,Rongqiang Zhao,Zhennan Huang,Songyu Ding,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes IT-OSE, an information-theoretic method to estimate optimal sample size for data augmentation, with ICD score for evaluation, reducing computational costs while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data augmentation lacks theoretical guidance for optimal sample size estimation, with no established metrics to evaluate accuracy or deviation from ground truth.

Method: Information-theoretic optimal sample size estimation (IT-OSE) with interval coverage and deviation (ICD) score for evaluation, theoretically analyzing relationship between OSS and dominant factors.

Result: IT-OSE improves classification accuracy by 4.38%, reduces MAPE in regression by 18.80%, reduces computational costs by 83.97% and data costs by 93.46% compared to exhaustive search.

Conclusion: IT-OSE provides reliable OSS estimation for industrial data augmentation with enhanced interpretability, stability, and practicality across sensor-based industrial scenarios.

Abstract: In industrial scenarios, data augmentation is an effective approach to improve model performance. However, its benefits are not unidirectionally beneficial. There is no theoretical research or established estimation for the optimal sample size (OSS) in augmentation, nor is there an established metric to evaluate the accuracy of OSS or its deviation from the ground truth. To address these issues, we propose an information-theoretic optimal sample size estimation (IT-OSE) to provide reliable OSS estimation for industrial data augmentation. An interval coverage and deviation (ICD) score is proposed to evaluate the estimated OSS intuitively. The relationship between OSS and dominant factors is theoretically analyzed and formulated, thereby enhancing the interpretability. Experiments show that, compared to empirical estimation, the IT-OSE increases accuracy in classification tasks across baseline models by an average of 4.38%, and reduces MAPE in regression tasks across baseline models by an average of 18.80%. The improvements in downstream model performance are more stable. ICDdev in the ICD score is also reduced by an average of 49.30%. The determinism of OSS is enhanced. Compared to exhaustive search, the IT-OSE achieves the same OSS while reducing computational and data costs by an average of 83.97% and 93.46%. Furthermore, practicality experiments demonstrate that the IT-OSE exhibits generality across representative sensor-based industrial scenarios.

### [142] [BamaER: A Behavior-Aware Memory-Augmented Model for Exercise Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15879)
*Qing Yang,Yuhao Jiang,Rui Wang,Jipeng Guo,Yejiang Wang,Xinghe Cheng,Zezheng Wu,Jiapu Wang,Jingwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BamaER is a behavior-aware memory-augmented exercise recommendation framework that improves personalized learning by capturing heterogeneous student interactions, modeling long-term knowledge dependencies, and optimizing exercise diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing exercise recommendation methods have two main limitations: (1) they represent student learning only as exercise sequences, ignoring rich behavioral interaction information, leading to biased learning progress estimates; (2) fixed-length sequence segmentation prevents incorporation of early learning experiences, hindering long-term dependency modeling and accurate knowledge mastery estimation.

Method: BamaER consists of three core modules: (1) Learning progress prediction module with tri-directional hybrid encoding to capture heterogeneous student interaction behaviors; (2) Memory-augmented knowledge tracing module with dynamic memory matrix to jointly model historical and current knowledge states; (3) Exercise filtering module that formulates candidate selection as diversity-aware optimization problem solved via Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm to reduce redundancy and improve coverage.

Result: Experiments on five real-world educational datasets show that BamaER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a range of evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: BamaER effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by incorporating behavioral interactions, modeling long-term dependencies through memory augmentation, and optimizing exercise diversity, resulting in more accurate and reliable exercise recommendations.

Abstract: Exercise recommendation focuses on personalized exercise selection conditioned on students' learning history, personal interests, and other individualized characteristics. Despite notable progress, most existing methods represent student learning solely as exercise sequences, overlooking rich behavioral interaction information. This limited representation often leads to biased and unreliable estimates of learning progress. Moreover, fixed-length sequence segmentation limits the incorporation of early learning experiences, thereby hindering the modeling of long-term dependencies and the accurate estimation of knowledge mastery. To address these limitations, we propose BamaER, a Behavior-aware memory-augmented Exercise Recommendation framework that comprises three core modules: (i) the learning progress prediction module that captures heterogeneous student interaction behaviors via a tri-directional hybrid encoding scheme; (ii) the memory-augmented knowledge tracing module that maintains a dynamic memory matrix to jointly model historical and current knowledge states for robust mastery estimation; and (iii) the exercise filtering module that formulates candidate selection as a diversity-aware optimization problem, solved via the Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm to reduce redundancy and improve recommendation coverage. Experiments on five real-world educational datasets show that BamaER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a range of evaluation metrics.

*Yixiao Qian,Jiaxu Liu,Zewei Xia,Song Chen,Chao Xu,Shengze Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distributed Physics-Informed Neural Networks framework with reference anchor normalization and CUDA acceleration for scalable flow reconstruction, solving pressure indeterminacy issues in domain decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs are powerful for flow reconstruction but face computational bottlenecks and optimization instabilities when scaling to large spatiotemporal domains, particularly due to pressure indeterminacy in distributed approaches.

Method: Proposes a distributed PINNs framework with spatiotemporal domain decomposition, reference anchor normalization strategy, decoupled asymmetric weighting, unidirectional information flow from master ranks, and CUDA graph/JIT compilation acceleration.

Result: Achieves near-linear strong scaling and high-fidelity reconstruction on complex flow benchmarks, eliminating gauge freedom and guaranteeing global pressure uniqueness while preserving temporal continuity.

Conclusion: Establishes a scalable and physically rigorous pathway for flow reconstruction and understanding of complex hydrodynamics by solving pressure indeterminacy issues in distributed PINNs.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a powerful paradigm for flow reconstruction, seamlessly integrating sparse velocity measurements with the governing Navier-Stokes equations to recover complete velocity and latent pressure fields. However, scaling such models to large spatiotemporal domains is hindered by computational bottlenecks and optimization instabilities. In this work, we propose a robust distributed PINNs framework designed for efficient flow reconstruction via spatiotemporal domain decomposition. A critical challenge in such distributed solvers is pressure indeterminacy, where independent sub-networks drift into inconsistent local pressure baselines. We address this issue through a reference anchor normalization strategy coupled with decoupled asymmetric weighting. By enforcing a unidirectional information flow from designated master ranks where the anchor point lies to neighboring ranks, our approach eliminates gauge freedom and guarantees global pressure uniqueness while preserving temporal continuity. Furthermore, to mitigate the Python interpreter overhead associated with computing high-order physics residuals, we implement a high-performance training pipeline accelerated by CUDA graphs and JIT compilation. Extensive validation on complex flow benchmarks demonstrates that our method achieves near-linear strong scaling and high-fidelity reconstruction, establishing a scalable and physically rigorous pathway for flow reconstruction and understanding of complex hydrodynamics.

### [144] [Adaptive Semi-Supervised Training of P300 ERP-BCI Speller System with Minimum Calibration Effort](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15955)
*Shumeng Chen,Jane E. Huggins,Tianwen Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A semi-supervised learning framework for P300 BCI spellers that reduces calibration time using adaptive EM-GMM with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional P300 BCI spellers require lengthy calibration procedures to build binary classifiers, which reduces overall system efficiency and practicality for real-time use.

Method: Proposed a unified framework using adaptive semi-supervised EM-GMM algorithm that updates the binary classifier with minimal labeled calibration data, combining both labeled and unlabeled data for improved adaptation.

Result: Out of 15 participants, 9 achieved minimum character-level accuracy of 0.7+ using either method, with 7 of those 9 showing better performance with the adaptive method compared to benchmark. Improved spelling efficiency in real-time BCI systems.

Conclusion: The semi-supervised learning framework provides a practical and efficient alternative to improve spelling efficiency in real-time BCI speller systems, especially in contexts with limited labeled data.

Abstract: A P300 ERP-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) speller is an assistive communication tool. It searches for the P300 event-related potential (ERP) elicited by target stimuli, distinguishing it from the neural responses to non-target stimuli embedded in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Conventional methods require a lengthy calibration procedure to construct the binary classifier, which reduced overall efficiency. Thus, we proposed a unified framework with minimum calibration effort such that, given a small amount of labeled calibration data, we employed an adaptive semi-supervised EM-GMM algorithm to update the binary classifier. We evaluated our method based on character-level prediction accuracy, information transfer rate (ITR), and BCI utility. We applied calibration on training data and reported results on testing data. Our results indicate that, out of 15 participants, 9 participants exceed the minimum character-level accuracy of 0.7 using either on our adaptive method or the benchmark, and 7 out of these 9 participants showed that our adaptive method performed better than the benchmark. The proposed semi-supervised learning framework provides a practical and efficient alternative to improve the overall spelling efficiency in the real-time BCI speller system, particularly in contexts with limited labeled data.

### [145] [R$^2$Energy: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Robust Renewable Energy Forecasting under Diverse and Extreme Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15961)
*Zhi Sheng,Yuan Yuan,Guozhen Zhang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: R²Energy is a large-scale benchmark for NWP-assisted renewable energy forecasting with 10.7M hourly records from 902 wind/solar stations in China, featuring standardized evaluation and revealing a robustness gap in extreme weather conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing frequency of climate-driven extreme weather events threatens grid stability, creating a need for robust forecasting models that can withstand volatile conditions beyond average accuracy metrics.

Method: Created a large-scale benchmark with 10.7M hourly records from 902 stations across four Chinese provinces, established a standardized leakage-free forecasting paradigm with identical NWP access, and incorporated regime-wise evaluation with extreme weather annotations.

Result: Uncovered a critical "robustness gap" where model reliability under extreme conditions depends on meteorological integration strategy rather than architectural complexity, revealing a stark robustness-complexity trade-off.

Conclusion: R²Energy provides a principled foundation for evaluating and developing forecasting models for safety-critical power system applications, emphasizing the importance of robustness over average accuracy in extreme weather scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of renewable energy, particularly wind and solar power, has made reliable forecasting critical for power system operations. While recent deep learning models have achieved strong average accuracy, the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven extreme weather events pose severe threats to grid stability and operational security. Consequently, developing robust forecasting models that can withstand volatile conditions has become a paramount challenge. In this paper, we present R$^2$Energy, a large-scale benchmark for NWP-assisted renewable energy forecasting. It comprises over 10.7 million high-fidelity hourly records from 902 wind and solar stations across four provinces in China, providing the diverse meteorological conditions necessary to capture the wide-ranging variability of renewable generation. We further establish a standardized, leakage-free forecasting paradigm that grants all models identical access to future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) signals, enabling fair and reproducible comparison across state-of-the-art representative forecasting architectures. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we incorporate regime-wise evaluation with expert-aligned extreme weather annotations, uncovering a critical ``robustness gap'' typically obscured by average metrics. This gap reveals a stark robustness-complexity trade-off: under extreme conditions, a model's reliability is driven by its meteorological integration strategy rather than its architectural complexity. R$^2$Energy provides a principled foundation for evaluating and developing forecasting models for safety-critical power system applications.

*Cherish Puniani,Tushar Kumar,Arnav Bendre,Gaurav Kumar,Shree Singhi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: B-DENSE is a diffusion model distillation framework that uses multi-branch trajectory alignment to accelerate sampling while preserving structural information lost in sparse supervision methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from high inference latency due to iterative sampling. Existing distillation techniques accelerate sampling but discard intermediate trajectory steps, leading to loss of structural information and discretization errors.

Method: Proposes B-DENSE with multi-branch trajectory alignment. Modifies student architecture to output K-fold expanded channels, where each subset corresponds to a specific branch representing discrete intermediate steps in teacher's trajectory. Trains branches to simultaneously map to entire sequence of teacher's target timesteps.

Result: Student model learns to navigate solution space from earliest training stages, demonstrating superior image generation quality compared to baseline distillation frameworks.

Conclusion: B-DENSE effectively mitigates structural information loss and discretization errors in diffusion model distillation through dense intermediate trajectory alignment.

Abstract: Inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics, diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling. However, their iterative sampling nature results in high inference latency. While recent distillation techniques accelerate sampling, they discard intermediate trajectory steps. This sparse supervision leads to a loss of structural information and introduces significant discretization errors. To mitigate this, we propose B-DENSE, a novel framework that leverages multi-branch trajectory alignment. We modify the student architecture to output $K$-fold expanded channels, where each subset corresponds to a specific branch representing a discrete intermediate step in the teacher's trajectory. By training these branches to simultaneously map to the entire sequence of the teacher's target timesteps, we enforce dense intermediate trajectory alignment. Consequently, the student model learns to navigate the solution space from the earliest stages of training, demonstrating superior image generation quality compared to baseline distillation frameworks.

### [147] [Fast Online Learning with Gaussian Prior-Driven Hierarchical Unimodal Thompson Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15972)
*Tianchi Zhao,He Liu,Hongyin Shi,Jinliang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSCG and UTSCG algorithms for Gaussian MAB with clustered arms achieve lower regret bounds than standard Thompson Sampling by exploiting hierarchical structure and unimodal rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world problems like mmWave communications and portfolio management involve Gaussian-distributed arms that are naturally clustered, creating opportunities to improve bandit algorithms by exploiting this hierarchical structure.

Method: Proposed Thompson Sampling with Clustered arms under Gaussian prior (TSCG) for 2-level hierarchical structure, and Unimodal Thompson Sampling with Clustered Arms under Gaussian prior (UTSCG) for unimodal reward cases.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows lower regret bounds than standard TSG, with UTSCG achieving even lower bounds for unimodal rewards. Numerical experiments confirm performance advantages.

Conclusion: Exploiting clustered arm structure in Gaussian MAB problems leads to improved regret bounds, with additional benefits when rewards are unimodal, making the algorithms practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: We study a type of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems in which arms with a Gaussian reward feedback are clustered. Such an arm setting finds applications in many real-world problems, for example, mmWave communications and portfolio management with risky assets, as a result of the universality of the Gaussian distribution. Based on the Thompson Sampling algorithm with Gaussian prior (TSG) algorithm for the selection of the optimal arm, we propose our Thompson Sampling with Clustered arms under Gaussian prior (TSCG) specific to the 2-level hierarchical structure. We prove that by utilizing the 2-level structure, we can achieve a lower regret bound than we do with ordinary TSG. In addition, when the reward is Unimodal, we can reach an even lower bound on the regret by our Unimodal Thompson Sampling algorithm with Clustered Arms under Gaussian prior (UTSCG). Each of our proposed algorithms are accompanied by theoretical evaluation of the upper regret bound, and our numerical experiments confirm the advantage of our proposed algorithms.

### [148] [Online Prediction of Stochastic Sequences with High Probability Regret Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16236)
*Matthias Frey,Jonathan H. Manton,Jingge Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates high-probability regret bounds for universal prediction of stochastic sequences, showing O(T^{-1/2}δ^{-1/2}) convergence with probability at least 1-δ, and proves this δ exponent is optimal without additional assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To complement existing expectation bounds for universal prediction by deriving high-probability regret bounds that hold with strong probability guarantees, addressing the gap between in-expectation results and practical high-confidence guarantees.

Method: The authors propose new high-probability regret bounds for universal prediction of stochastic sequences over countable alphabets, analyzing the relationship between convergence rate, time horizon T, and confidence parameter δ. They also provide an impossibility result showing the optimality of their bound structure.

Result: Achieves O(T^{-1/2}δ^{-1/2}) convergence rate with probability at least 1-δ, matching the form of prior expectation bounds (O(T^{-1/2})) while adding the δ dependence. Proves the exponent of δ cannot be improved without additional assumptions.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges the gap between expectation and high-probability bounds for universal prediction, providing tight high-confidence guarantees with optimal dependence on the confidence parameter δ, establishing fundamental limits on what can be achieved without stronger assumptions.

Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of universal prediction of stochastic sequences with a finite time horizon $T$ known to the learner. The question we investigate is whether it is possible to derive vanishing regret bounds that hold with high probability, complementing existing bounds from the literature that hold in expectation. We propose such high-probability bounds which have a very similar form as the prior expectation bounds. For the case of universal prediction of a stochastic process over a countable alphabet, our bound states a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2} δ^{-1/2})$ with probability as least $1-δ$ compared to prior known in-expectation bounds of the order $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2})$. We also propose an impossibility result which proves that it is not possible to improve the exponent of $δ$ in a bound of the same form without making additional assumptions.

*Riccardo De Santi,Kimon Protopapas,Ya-Ping Hsieh,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flow Expander (FE) adapts pre-trained flow/diffusion models to generate diverse valid samples beyond limited training data using verifier-guided entropy maximization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained flow/diffusion models trained on limited data (e.g., molecular samples) generate samples only from narrow portions of the feasible design space, limiting scientific discovery applications that require exploring beyond available data distributions.

Method: Introduces formal notions of strong/weak verifiers and proposes Flow Expander (FE) - a scalable mirror descent scheme for verifier-constrained entropy maximization over the flow process noised state space, enabling both global and local flow expansion.

Result: Provides theoretical analysis with convergence guarantees under idealized and general assumptions, and empirical evaluation showing FE expands pre-trained flow models to increase conformer diversity while preserving validity in molecular design tasks.

Conclusion: FE successfully addresses the limitation of flow/diffusion models by leveraging verifiers to expand beyond training data distributions while maintaining sample validity, enabling broader exploration of design spaces for scientific discovery.

Abstract: Flow and diffusion models are typically pre-trained on limited available data (e.g., molecular samples), covering only a fraction of the valid design space (e.g., the full molecular space). As a consequence, they tend to generate samples from only a narrow portion of the feasible domain. This is a fundamental limitation for scientific discovery applications, where one typically aims to sample valid designs beyond the available data distribution. To this end, we address the challenge of leveraging access to a verifier (e.g., an atomic bonds checker), to adapt a pre-trained flow model so that its induced density expands beyond regions of high data availability, while preserving samples validity. We introduce formal notions of strong and weak verifiers and propose algorithmic frameworks for global and local flow expansion via probability-space optimization. Then, we present Flow Expander (FE), a scalable mirror descent scheme that provably tackles both problems by verifier-constrained entropy maximization over the flow process noised state space. Next, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed method, and state convergence guarantees under both idealized and general assumptions. Ultimately, we empirically evaluate our method on both illustrative, yet visually interpretable settings, and on a molecular design task showcasing the ability of FE to expand a pre-trained flow model increasing conformer diversity while preserving validity.

### [150] [Anatomy of Capability Emergence: Scale-Invariant Representation Collapse and Top-Down Reorganization in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15997)
*Jayadev Billa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes geometric measures during neural network training to understand capability emergence, finding universal representation collapse patterns, top-down propagation, and geometric hierarchy where representation geometry predicts emergence better than other measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanistic opacity of capability emergence during neural network training by tracking geometric measures across different model scales, tasks, and language models.

Method: Tracked five geometric measures across five model scales (405K-85M parameters), 120+ emergence events in eight algorithmic tasks, and three Pythia language models (160M-2.8B). Analyzed representation collapse patterns, propagation direction, and predictive relationships between geometric measures and emergence.

Result: Found: (1) universal representation collapse to scale-invariant task-specific floors; (2) top-down propagation through layers (contradicting bottom-up intuition); (3) geometric hierarchy where representation geometry leads emergence (75-100% precursor rate for hard tasks), while local learning coefficient is synchronous and Hessian measures lag. Also identified prediction limits: geometric measures encode coarse task difficulty but not fine-grained timing.

Conclusion: Provides geometric anatomy of emergence and its boundary conditions, showing that geometric patterns replicate in Pythia but per-task precursor signals require task-training alignment not provided by naturalistic pre-training. This is a mechanistic understanding contribution, not a prediction tool.

Abstract: Capability emergence during neural network training remains mechanistically opaque. We track five geometric measures across five model scales (405K-85M parameters), 120+ emergence events in eight algorithmic tasks, and three Pythia language models (160M-2.8B). We find: (1) training begins with a universal representation collapse to task-specific floors that are scale-invariant across a 210X parameter range (e.g., modular arithmetic collapses to RANKME ~ 2.0 regardless of model size); (2) collapse propagates top-down through layers (32/32 task X model consistency), contradicting bottom-up feature-building intuition; (3) a geometric hierarchy in which representation geometry leads emergence (75-100% precursor rate for hard tasks), while the local learning coefficient is synchronous (0/24 precursor) and Hessian measures lag. We also delineate prediction limits: geometric measures encode coarse task difficulty but not fine-grained timing (within-class concordance 27%; when task ordering reverses across scales, prediction fails at 26%). On Pythia, global geometric patterns replicate but per-task precursor signals do not -- the precursor relationship requires task-training alignment that naturalistic pre-training does not provide. Our contribution is the geometric anatomy of emergence and its boundary conditions, not a prediction tool.

*Marzieh Amiri Shahbazi,Ali Baheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive geodesic conformal prediction extends conformal prediction to Riemannian manifolds using geodesic residuals and difficulty estimation, producing better-calibrated prediction regions than Euclidean methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conformal prediction methods assume Euclidean output spaces and perform poorly when responses lie on Riemannian manifolds, producing poorly calibrated prediction regions due to chart distortion.

Method: Proposes adaptive geodesic conformal prediction framework that replaces Euclidean residuals with geodesic nonconformity scores and normalizes them by cross-validated difficulty estimators to handle heteroscedastic noise, resulting in geodesic caps on spheres.

Result: The method produces prediction regions with position-independent area that adapt to local prediction difficulty, yielding substantially more uniform conditional coverage than non-adaptive alternatives. In synthetic sphere experiments and real-world geomagnetic field forecasting tasks, it reduces conditional coverage variability and raises worst-case coverage closer to nominal levels.

Conclusion: Adaptive geodesic conformal prediction effectively extends conformal prediction to Riemannian manifolds, overcoming limitations of coordinate-based methods that waste coverage area due to chart distortion.

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides distribution-free coverage guaranties for regression; yet existing methods assume Euclidean output spaces and produce prediction regions that are poorly calibrated when responses lie on Riemannian manifolds. We propose \emph{adaptive geodesic conformal prediction}, a framework that replaces Euclidean residuals with geodesic nonconformity scores and normalizes them by a cross-validated difficulty estimator to handle heteroscedastic noise. The resulting prediction regions, geodesic caps on the sphere, have position-independent area and adapt their size to local prediction difficulty, yielding substantially more uniform conditional coverage than non-adaptive alternatives. In a synthetic sphere experiment with strong heteroscedasticity and a real-world geomagnetic field forecasting task derived from IGRF-14 satellite data, the adaptive method markedly reduces conditional coverage variability and raises worst-case coverage much closer to the nominal level, while coordinate-based baselines waste a large fraction of coverage area due to chart distortion.

TL;DR: Spectral EEG features show higher cross-subject similarity than temporal features; ASPEN architecture uses multiplicative fusion of spectral-temporal streams to achieve optimal balance and improve cross-subject BCI generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-subject generalization in EEG-based BCIs is challenging due to individual neural variability. The paper investigates whether spectral representations provide more stable features for cross-subject transfer compared to temporal waveforms.

Method: 1. Correlation analyses across three EEG paradigms (SSVEP, P300, Motor Imagery) to compare spectral vs. temporal feature similarity. 2. Introduction of ASPEN - a hybrid architecture combining spectral and temporal feature streams via multiplicative fusion that requires cross-modal agreement for feature propagation.

Result: 1. Spectral features exhibit consistently higher cross-subject similarity than temporal signals. 2. ASPEN dynamically achieves optimal spectral-temporal balance depending on the paradigm. 3. Achieves best unseen-subject accuracy on 3/6 benchmark datasets and competitive performance on others.

Conclusion: Multiplicative multimodal fusion of spectral and temporal features enables effective cross-subject generalization in EEG-based BCIs, with ASPEN demonstrating superior performance by leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations.

Abstract: Cross-subject generalization in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains challenging due to individual variability in neural signals. We investigate whether spectral representations offer more stable features for cross-subject transfer than temporal waveforms. Through correlation analyses across three EEG paradigms (SSVEP, P300, and Motor Imagery), we find that spectral features exhibit consistently higher cross-subject similarity than temporal signals. Motivated by this observation, we introduce ASPEN, a hybrid architecture that combines spectral and temporal feature streams via multiplicative fusion, requiring cross-modal agreement for features to propagate. Experiments across six benchmark datasets reveal that ASPEN is able to dynamically achieve the optimal spectral-temporal balance depending on the paradigm. ASPEN achieves the best unseen-subject accuracy on three of six datasets and competitive performance on others, demonstrating that multiplicative multimodal fusion enables effective cross-subject generalization.

Conclusion: Paves the way for data-driven generative discovery of molecular crystals by providing an effective framework for molecular crystal structure prediction.

Abstract: Molecular crystal structure prediction represents a grand challenge in computational chemistry due to large sizes of constituent molecules and complex intra- and intermolecular interactions. While generative modeling has revolutionized structure discovery for molecules, inorganic solids, and metal-organic frameworks, extending such approaches to fully periodic molecular crystals is still elusive. Here, we present MolCrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model for molecular crystal structure prediction. The framework disentangles intramolecular complexity from intermolecular packing by embedding molecules as rigid bodies and jointly learning the lattice matrix, molecular orientations, and centroid positions. Centroids and orientations are represented on their native Riemannian manifolds, allowing geodesic flow construction and graph neural network operations that respects geometric symmetries. We benchmark our model against state-of-the-art generative models for large-size periodic crystals and rule-based structure generation methods on two open-source molecular crystal datasets. We demonstrate an integration of MolCrystalFlow model with universal machine learning potential to accelerate molecular crystal structure prediction, paving the way for data-driven generative discovery of molecular crystals.

TL;DR: AI-CARE is a tool for benchmarking ML models on energy consumption and carbon emissions alongside performance metrics, introducing carbon-performance tradeoff curves to visualize Pareto frontiers and promote sustainable ML development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML benchmarks focus only on performance metrics (accuracy, BLEU, mAP) while ignoring environmental costs. This is problematic for large-scale deployment in energy-constrained environments (mobile devices, developing regions) and climate-aware enterprises, creating misalignment with practical sustainability requirements.

Method: Proposes AI-CARE evaluation tool for reporting energy consumption and carbon emissions of ML models. Introduces carbon-performance tradeoff curves that visualize Pareto frontiers between performance and carbon cost. Uses theoretical analysis and empirical validation on representative ML workloads.

Result: Carbon-aware benchmarking changes the relative ranking of models and encourages architectures that are both accurate and environmentally responsible. The tool demonstrates that considering environmental metrics alters model evaluation outcomes.

Conclusion: AI-CARE aims to shift the research community toward transparent, multi-objective evaluation and align ML progress with global sustainability goals. The tool is publicly available to promote environmentally responsible ML development.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) continues its rapid expansion, the environmental cost of model training and inference has become a critical societal concern. Existing benchmarks overwhelmingly focus on standard performance metrics such as accuracy, BLEU, or mAP, while largely ignoring energy consumption and carbon emissions. This single-objective evaluation paradigm is increasingly misaligned with the practical requirements of large-scale deployment, particularly in energy-constrained environments such as mobile devices, developing regions, and climate-aware enterprises. In this paper, we propose AI-CARE, an evaluation tool for reporting energy consumption, and carbon emissions of ML models. In addition, we introduce the carbon-performance tradeoff curve, an interpretable tool that visualizes the Pareto frontier between performance and carbon cost. We demonstrate, through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on representative ML workloads, that carbon-aware benchmarking changes the relative ranking of models and encourages architectures that are simultaneously accurate and environmentally responsible. Our proposal aims to shift the research community toward transparent, multi-objective evaluation and align ML progress with global sustainability goals.

*Bradley McDanel,Steven Li,Sruthikesh Surineni,Harshit Khaitan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE-Spec is a training-free expert budgeting method for speculative decoding of Mixture-of-Experts models that enforces fixed expert capacity limits to reduce memory pressure while maintaining verification parallelism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference but faces severe bottlenecks with MoE models - large draft trees activate many unique experts, increasing memory pressure and diminishing speedups relative to autoregressive decoding.

Method: MoE-Spec decouples speculation depth from memory cost by enforcing a fixed expert capacity limit at each layer, loading only the most important experts for verification and dropping the long tail of rarely used experts that drive bandwidth overhead.

Result: Experiments across multiple model scales and datasets show 10-30% higher throughput than state-of-the-art speculative decoding baselines (EAGLE-3) at comparable quality, with flexibility to trade accuracy for further latency reductions.

Conclusion: MoE-Spec provides an effective training-free solution to the memory bottleneck problem in speculative decoding for MoE models, enabling better parallelism while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by verifying multiple drafted tokens in parallel. However, for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, this parallelism introduces a severe bottleneck: large draft trees activate many unique experts, significantly increasing memory pressure and diminishing speedups from speculative decoding relative to autoregressive decoding. Prior methods reduce speculation depth when MoE verification becomes expensive. We propose MoE-Spec, a training-free verification-time expert budgeting method that decouples speculation depth from memory cost by enforcing a fixed expert capacity limit at each layer, loading only the experts that contribute most to verification and dropping the long tail of rarely used experts that drive bandwidth overhead. Experiments across multiple model scales and datasets show that this method yields 10--30\% higher throughput than state-of-the-art speculative decoding baselines (EAGLE-3) at comparable quality, with flexibility to trade accuracy for further latency reductions through tighter budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mental health care faces workforce shortages and cost constraints, while current AI alignment approaches fail to balance patient preferences with clinical safety requirements.

Method: Surveyed 335 individuals with mental health experience to collect preference rankings, then developed multi-objective alignment framework using direct preference optimization with reward models for six therapeutic criteria.

Result: MODPO achieved superior balance (77.6% empathy, 62.6% safety) vs single-objective optimization (93.6% empathy, 47.8% safety), with therapeutic criteria outperforming general communication principles by 17.2%.

Conclusion: Multi-objective DPO provides effective alignment for therapeutic AI systems, with blinded clinician evaluation confirming consistent preference and LLM-evaluator agreement comparable to inter-clinician reliability.

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect over 1 billion people worldwide, yet access to care remains limited by workforce shortages and cost constraints. While AI systems show therapeutic promise, current alignment approaches optimize objectives independently, failing to balance patient preferences with clinical safety. We survey 335 individuals with lived mental health experience to collect preference rankings across therapeutic dimensions, then develop a multi-objective alignment framework using direct preference optimization. We train reward models for six criteria -- empathy, safety, active listening, self-motivated change, trust/rapport, and patient autonomy -- and systematically compare multi-objective approaches against single-objective optimization, supervised fine-tuning, and parameter merging. Multi-objective DPO (MODPO) achieves superior balance (77.6% empathy, 62.6% safety) compared to single-objective optimization (93.6% empathy, 47.8% safety), and therapeutic criteria outperform general communication principles by 17.2%. Blinded clinician evaluation confirms MODPO is consistently preferred, with LLM-evaluator agreement comparable to inter-clinician reliability.

TL;DR: Multi-view tensor decomposition framework analyzes driver behavior at railway crossings across three temporal phases to identify shared behavioral patterns across locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches analyze railway crossings individually, limiting ability to identify shared behavioral patterns across locations. Need scalable method to discover behavioral similarities across multiple crossings for targeted safety interventions.

Method: Propose multi-view tensor decomposition framework analyzing three temporal phases: Approach, Waiting, and Clearance. Use TimeSformer embeddings from railway crossing videos, construct phase-specific similarity matrices, apply non-negative symmetric CP decomposition to discover latent behavioral components with distinct temporal signatures.

Result: Crossing location appears stronger determinant of behavior patterns than time of day. Approach-phase behavior provides particularly discriminative signatures. Visualization shows location-based clustering with certain crossings forming distinct behavioral clusters.

Conclusion: Automated framework enables scalable pattern discovery across multiple crossings, providing foundation for grouping locations by behavioral similarity to inform targeted safety interventions.

Abstract: Railway crossings present complex safety challenges where driver behavior varies by location, time, and conditions. Traditional approaches analyze crossings individually, limiting the ability to identify shared behavioral patterns across locations. We propose a multi-view tensor decomposition framework that captures behavioral similarities across three temporal phases: Approach (warning activation to gate lowering), Waiting (gates down to train passage), and Clearance (train passage to gate raising). We analyze railway crossing videos from multiple locations using TimeSformer embeddings to represent each phase. By constructing phase-specific similarity matrices and applying non-negative symmetric CP decomposition, we discover latent behavioral components with distinct temporal signatures. Our tensor analysis reveals that crossing location appears to be a stronger determinant of behavior patterns than time of day, and that approach-phase behavior provides particularly discriminative signatures. Visualization of the learned component space confirms location-based clustering, with certain crossings forming distinct behavioral clusters. This automated framework enables scalable pattern discovery across multiple crossings, providing a foundation for grouping locations by behavioral similarity to inform targeted safety interventions.

*Kevin Wang,Hongqian Niu,Didong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Recursive training of generative AI on mixed human/AI-generated data converges with rate equal to min(baseline convergence rate, fraction of real data used), showing positive theoretical results without distributional assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative AI systems become widespread, web data becomes contaminated with AI-generated content, creating a recursive training loop where later models train on mixtures of human and AI-generated data. Existing theoretical work only examines simplified settings (discrete/Gaussian), but real data distributions are complex and modern models are more flexible.

Method: Study recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on real data distribution, allowing generative models to be universal approximators. Extend analysis to settings with sampling bias in data collection and support theoretical results with empirical studies.

Result: Contaminated recursive training converges with convergence rate equal to the minimum of the baseline model's convergence rate and the fraction of real data used in each iteration. This is the first positive theoretical result on recursive training without distributional assumptions on data.

Conclusion: Recursive training of generative models on mixed human/AI-generated data converges under general conditions, with convergence rate determined by baseline model performance and proportion of real data. The analysis provides theoretical foundation for understanding real-world AI training scenarios with data contamination.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as large language models (LLMs), has become a transformative force across science, industry, and society. As these systems grow in popularity, web data becomes increasingly interwoven with this AI-generated material and it is increasingly difficult to separate them from naturally generated content. As generative models are updated regularly, later models will inevitably be trained on mixtures of human-generated data and AI-generated data from earlier versions, creating a recursive training process with data contamination. Existing theoretical work has examined only highly simplified settings, where both the real data and the generative model are discrete or Gaussian, where it has been shown that such recursive training leads to model collapse. However, real data distributions are far more complex, and modern generative models are far more flexible than Gaussian and linear mechanisms. To fill this gap, we study recursive training in a general framework with minimal assumptions on the real data distribution and allow the underlying generative model to be a general universal approximator. In this framework, we show that contaminated recursive training still converges, with a convergence rate equal to the minimum of the baseline model's convergence rate and the fraction of real data used in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first (positive) theoretical result on recursive training without distributional assumptions on the data. We further extend the analysis to settings where sampling bias is present in data collection and support all theoretical results with empirical studies.

TL;DR: Omni-iEEG is a large-scale, standardized intracranial EEG dataset with 302 patients and 178 hours of recordings, including expert-validated annotations and clinical metadata, designed to bridge machine learning and epilepsy research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current epilepsy research faces challenges with inconsistent iEEG formats, lack of standardized benchmarks, limited pathological event annotations, and barriers to reproducibility and cross-center validation, hindering clinically relevant machine learning applications.

Method: Reconciled heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings from publicly available sources to create a harmonized dataset with clinical metadata (seizure onset zones, resections, outcomes) and over 36K expert-validated pathological event annotations.

Result: Created Omni-iEEG with 302 patients and 178 hours of high-resolution recordings, established clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics, demonstrated end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments, and showed transferability of pretrained representations.

Conclusion: Omni-iEEG provides a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research by bridging machine learning with clinical needs through standardized data, annotations, and evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, and one-third of patients suffer drug-resistant seizures where surgery offers the best chance of seizure freedom. Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research.

### [160] [Why Any-Order Autoregressive Models Need Two-Stream Attention: A Structural-Semantic Tradeoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16092)
*Patrick Pynadath,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-stream attention in AO-ARMs addresses a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation, not just position-content separation as previously thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the true role of two-stream attention in any-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs). While two-stream attention has been motivated as separating token content from position, the authors suspect it may be serving a more subtle purpose related to the competing demands of any-order generation.

Method: The authors propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. This allows them to isolate the structural-semantic tradeoff from position-content separation. They test this approach at different sequence lengths to observe how performance changes as semantic and structural proximity diverge.

Result: Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths where semantic and structural proximity coincide, but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. This suggests that two-stream attention's success stems from addressing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation.

Conclusion: The success of two-stream attention in AO-ARMs is not merely about separating position from content, but rather about circumventing the fundamental structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation, where hidden representations must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization.

Abstract: Any-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs) offer a promising path toward efficient masked diffusion by enabling native key-value caching, but competitive performance has so far required two-stream attention, typically motivated as a means of decoupling token content from position. In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Semantic-aware continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics using VAE embeddings fused with AI-extracted metadata and gradient boosting, enabling adaptation to evolving operational conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Railway maintenance needs reliable predictive systems, but traditional methods require manual feature engineering and deep learning models degrade with evolving operational patterns in online settings.

Method: 1) VAE encodes accelerometer signals into latent representations unsupervised; 2) AI-driven peak detection extracts semantic metadata (axle counts, wheel indexes, strain deformations) from fiber Bragg grating sensors; 3) Metadata fused with VAE embeddings; 4) Lightweight gradient boosting classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring; 5) Replay-based continual learning enables adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Model detects minor imperfections (flats and polygonization) while adapting to evolving operational conditions (train type, speed, load, track profiles) using single accelerometer and strain gauge in wayside monitoring.

Conclusion: The framework provides label-efficient, semantic-aware continual learning for railway fault diagnostics that adapts to changing operational conditions while maintaining detection performance.

Abstract: Reliable and cost-effective maintenance is essential for railway safety, particularly at the wheel-rail interface, which is prone to wear and failure. Predictive maintenance frameworks increasingly leverage sensor-generated time-series data, yet traditional methods require manual feature engineering, and deep learning models often degrade in online settings with evolving operational patterns. This work presents a semantic-aware, label-efficient continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics. Accelerometer signals are encoded via a Variational AutoEncoder into latent representations capturing the normal operational structure in a fully unsupervised manner. Importantly, semantic metadata, including axle counts, wheel indexes, and strain-based deformations, is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors (resistant to electromagnetic interference) and fused with the VAE embeddings, enhancing anomaly detection under unknown operational conditions. A lightweight gradient boosting supervised classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring with minimal labels, while a replay-based continual learning strategy enables adaptation to evolving domains without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show the model detects minor imperfections due to flats and polygonization, while adapting to evolving operational conditions, such as changes in train type, speed, load, and track profiles, captured using a single accelerometer and strain gauge in wayside monitoring.

TL;DR: A computational pipeline for statistical analysis of shape graph datasets that extracts topological, geometric, and directional features to analyze both connectivity structure and geometric differences in embedded networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph analysis focuses only on connectivity structure, but shape graphs (geometric networks embedded in 2D/3D spaces) also have important geometric variations in network branches that need to be analyzed.

Method: Extracts a curated set of topological, geometric, and directional features designed with key invariance properties, then uses this feature representation for statistical analysis tasks like group comparison, clustering, and classification.

Result: The method is evaluated on real-world datasets including urban road networks, neuronal traces, and astrocyte imaging, and benchmarked against alternative feature-based and non-feature-based methods, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed computational pipeline provides an effective approach for statistical analysis of shape graphs by capturing both connectivity and geometric variations through carefully designed invariant features.

Abstract: This paper introduces and demonstrates a computational pipeline for the statistical analysis of shape graph datasets, namely geometric networks embedded in 2D or 3D spaces. Unlike traditional abstract graphs, our purpose is not only to retrieve and distinguish variations in the connectivity structure of the data but also geometric differences of the network branches. Our proposed approach relies on the extraction of a specifically curated and explicit set of topological, geometric and directional features, designed to satisfy key invariance properties. We leverage the resulting feature representation for tasks such as group comparison, clustering and classification on cohorts of shape graphs. The effectiveness of this representation is evaluated on several real-world datasets including urban road/street networks, neuronal traces and astrocyte imaging. These results are benchmarked against several alternative methods, both feature-based and not.

*Leo,Wang,Connor Mclaughlin,Lili Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that carefully selecting a subset of data sources for joint learning can achieve optimal subspace estimation, even when discarding substantial data, by identifying informative subpopulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While shared representation learning effectively separates commonalities from heterogeneity, existing methods include all related data sources simultaneously. However, even among "good" sources with similar relevance and quality, some may still hinder optimal representation learning. The paper investigates which data sources should be learned jointly for statistically optimal subspace estimation.

Method: Focuses on linear setting where sources share a low-dimensional subspace. Develops algorithms and practical heuristics to identify informative subpopulations of data sources. Formalizes the notion of informative subpopulations and shows that training on carefully selected subsets suffices for optimal performance.

Result: For a broad class of problem instances, training on a carefully selected subset of sources achieves minimax optimality in subspace estimation, even when discarding substantial portions of data. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of source screening.

Conclusion: Source screening plays a central role in statistically optimal subspace estimation. Rather than using all available data sources, identifying and training on informative subpopulations can lead to better representation learning outcomes while potentially discarding irrelevant or hindering data.

Abstract: Learning with shared representation is widely recognized as an effective way to separate commonalities from heterogeneity across various heterogeneous sources. Most existing work includes all related data sources via simultaneously training a common feature extractor and source-specific heads. It is well understood that data sources with low relevance or poor quality may hinder representation learning. In this paper, we further dive into the question of which data sources should be learned jointly by focusing on the traditionally deemed ``good'' collection of sources, in which individual sources have similar relevance and qualities with respect to the true underlying common structure. Towards tractability, we focus on the linear setting where sources share a low-dimensional subspace. We find that source screening can play a central role in statistically optimal subspace estimation. We show that, for a broad class of problem instances, training on a carefully selected subset of sources suffices to achieve minimax optimality, even when a substantial portion of data is discarded. We formalize the notion of an informative subpopulation, develop algorithms and practical heuristics for identifying such subsets, and validate their effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets.

*Mohammed Zain Ali Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method to generate random graphs with correlated node features to better model real-world networks, showing that GNNs can avoid convergence and be more expressive than previously thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on GNN convergence behavior on random graphs fail to model correlations between node features, which are common in real-life networks. This leads to inaccurate limitations on GNN expressive power when applied to realistic graphs.

Method: Introduces a novel method to generate random graphs with correlated node features, where features are sampled to ensure correlation between neighboring nodes. The sampling scheme is motivated by properties of real-life graphs captured by the Barabási-Albert model.

Result: Theoretical analysis indicates convergence can be avoided in some cases, which is empirically validated on large random graphs generated using the novel method. Observed divergent behavior provides evidence that GNNs may be more expressive than initial studies suggested.

Conclusion: GNNs may be more expressive than previously thought, especially on realistic graphs with correlated node features, challenging existing limitations derived from studies that don't model such correlations.

Abstract: There are a number of existing studies analysing the convergence behaviour of graph neural networks on large random graphs. Unfortunately, the majority of these studies do not model correlations between node features, which would naturally exist in a variety of real-life networks. Consequently, the derived limitations of GNNs, resulting from such convergence behaviour, is not truly reflective of the expressive power of GNNs when applied to realistic graphs. In this paper, we will introduce a novel method to generate random graphs that have correlated node features. The node features will be sampled in such a manner to ensure correlation between neighbouring nodes. As motivation for our choice of sampling scheme, we will appeal to properties exhibited by real-life graphs, particularly properties that are captured by the Barabási-Albert model. A theoretical analysis will strongly indicate that convergence can be avoided in some cases, which we will empirically validate on large random graphs generated using our novel method. The observed divergent behaviour provides evidence that GNNs may be more expressive than initial studies would suggest, especially on realistic graphs.

*Difei Xu,Meng Ding,Zebin Ma,Huanyi Xie,Youming Tao,Aicha Slaitane,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies differentially private distributionally robust optimization (DP-DRO) with ψ-divergence and non-convex loss, developing novel DP optimization methods that achieve improved utility bounds compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world ML deployments face distribution shifts, group imbalances, and adversarial perturbations where traditional ERM degrades. DRO offers robustness but training data contains sensitive information requiring DP protection. DP-DRO has received less attention than DP-ERM due to its minimax optimization structure with uncertainty constraints.

Method: 1) For general ψ-divergence DRO: Reformulate as minimization problem and develop DP Double-Spider method. 2) For KL-divergence DRO: Transform into compositional finite-sum optimization and develop DP Recursive-Spider method. Both methods are (ε,δ)-DP optimization approaches tailored to DRO structure.

Result: DP Double-Spider achieves gradient norm utility bound of O(1/√n + (√d log(1/δ)/nε)^{2/3}). DP Recursive-Spider for KL-divergence achieves O((√d log(1/δ)/nε)^{2/3}), matching best-known non-convex DP-ERM results. Experiments show proposed methods outperform existing DP minimax optimization approaches.

Conclusion: The paper bridges the gap in DP-DRO research by developing novel DP optimization methods for ψ-divergence DRO with non-convex loss, achieving improved utility bounds and demonstrating practical superiority over existing approaches for robust and private machine learning.

Abstract: Real-world deployments routinely face distribution shifts, group imbalances, and adversarial perturbations, under which the traditional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework can degrade severely.
  Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this issue by optimizing the worst-case expected loss over an uncertainty set of distributions, offering a principled approach to robustness.
  Meanwhile, as training data in DRO always involves sensitive information, safeguarding it against leakage under Differential Privacy (DP) is essential.
  In contrast to classical DP-ERM, DP-DRO has received much less attention due to its minimax optimization structure with uncertainty constraint.
  To bridge the gap, we provide a comprehensive study of DP-(finite-sum)-DRO with $ψ$-divergence and non-convex loss.
  First, we study DRO with general $ψ$-divergence by reformulating it as a minimization problem, and develop a novel $(\varepsilon, δ)$-DP optimization method, called DP Double-Spider, tailored to this structure.
  Under mild assumptions, we show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+ (\frac{\sqrt{d \log (1/δ)}}{n \varepsilon})^{2/3})$ in terms of the gradient norm, where $n$ denotes the data size and $d$ denotes the model dimension.
  We further improve the utility rate for specific divergences.
  In particular, for DP-DRO with KL-divergence, by transforming the problem into a compositional finite-sum optimization problem, we develop a DP Recursive-Spider method and show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}((\frac{\sqrt{d \log(1/δ)}}{n\varepsilon})^{2/3} )$, matching the best-known result for non-convex DP-ERM.
  Experimentally, we demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform existing approaches for DP minimax optimization.

### [166] [HiPER: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Credit Assignment for Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16165)
*Jiangweizhi Peng,Yuanxin Liu,Ruida Zhou,Charles Fleming,Zhaoran Wang,Alfredo Garcia,Mingyi Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiPER introduces a hierarchical RL framework for LLM agents that separates planning from execution, using hierarchical advantage estimation to improve credit assignment in sparse-reward, long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLMs as interactive agents for multi-turn decision-making is challenging in long-horizon tasks with sparse/delayed rewards. Existing flat RL policies struggle with credit assignment across long trajectories, leading to unstable optimization.

Method: HiPER factorizes policy into high-level planner (proposes subgoals) and low-level executor (carries out actions). Uses hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE) to assign credit at both levels, aggregating returns over subgoal execution for unbiased gradients and reduced variance.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance: 97.4% success on ALFWorld and 83.3% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6% and +8.3% over best prior method). Shows especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks.

Conclusion: Explicit hierarchical decomposition is crucial for scalable RL training of multi-turn LLM agents, with HiPER demonstrating significant improvements in sparse-reward, long-horizon decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Training LLMs as interactive agents for multi-turn decision-making remains challenging, particularly in long-horizon tasks with sparse and delayed rewards, where agents must execute extended sequences of actions before receiving meaningful feedback. Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment.
  We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation.
  Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\% and +8.3\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks. These results highlight the importance of explicit hierarchical decomposition for scalable RL training of multi-turn LLM agents.

*Binghang Lu,Jiahao Zhang,Guang Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpecMuon is a spectral-aware optimizer that combines Muon's orthogonalized geometry with a mode-wise relaxed scalar auxiliary variable mechanism to improve optimization for physics-informed neural networks and neural operators by addressing ill-conditioned gradients and stiffness issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-informed neural networks and neural operators face severe optimization difficulties including ill-conditioned gradients, multi-scale spectral behavior, and stiffness from physical constraints. Existing optimizers like Muon show promise but lack stability guarantees and may take overly aggressive steps.

Method: SpecMuon integrates Muon's orthogonalized updates in singular-vector basis with a mode-wise relaxed scalar auxiliary variable (RSAV) mechanism. It decomposes matrix-valued gradients into singular modes and applies RSAV updates individually along dominant spectral directions, adaptively regulating step sizes according to global loss energy while preserving scale-balancing properties.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows SpecMuon has a modified energy dissipation law, positivity and boundedness of auxiliary variables, and global convergence with linear rate under Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Numerical experiments on PINNs, DeepONets, and fractional PINN-DeepONets demonstrate faster convergence and improved stability compared to Adam, AdamW, and original Muon on benchmark problems like 1D Burgers equation and fractional PDEs.

Conclusion: SpecMuon provides a principled spectral-aware optimization framework that addresses stiffness and conditioning issues in physics-informed learning, offering both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements over existing optimizers.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks and neural operators often suffer from severe optimization difficulties caused by ill-conditioned gradients, multi-scale spectral behavior, and stiffness induced by physical constraints. Recently, the Muon optimizer has shown promise by performing orthogonalized updates in the singular-vector basis of the gradient, thereby improving geometric conditioning. However, its unit-singular-value updates may lead to overly aggressive steps and lack explicit stability guarantees when applied to physics-informed learning. In this work, we propose SpecMuon, a spectral-aware optimizer that integrates Muon's orthogonalized geometry with a mode-wise relaxed scalar auxiliary variable (RSAV) mechanism. By decomposing matrix-valued gradients into singular modes and applying RSAV updates individually along dominant spectral directions, SpecMuon adaptively regulates step sizes according to the global loss energy while preserving Muon's scale-balancing properties. This formulation interprets optimization as a multi-mode gradient flow and enables principled control of stiff spectral components. We establish rigorous theoretical properties of SpecMuon, including a modified energy dissipation law, positivity and boundedness of auxiliary variables, and global convergence with a linear rate under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Numerical experiments on physics-informed neural networks, DeepONets, and fractional PINN-DeepONets demonstrate that SpecMuon achieves faster convergence and improved stability compared with Adam, AdamW, and the original Muon optimizer on benchmark problems such as the one-dimensional Burgers equation and fractional partial differential equations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DSL (Discrete Stochastic Localization) improves masked diffusion language models by training a single SNR-invariant denoiser across multiple corruption levels, achieving 4x fewer denoiser evaluations while matching autoregressive quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-autoregressive generation suffers from error accumulation and distribution shift during iterative refinement. Existing masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) with remasking samplers (ReMDM) have efficiency limitations that could be improved through better training approaches.

Method: Proposes DSL (Discrete Stochastic Localization) which trains a single SNR-invariant denoiser across a continuum of corruption levels, bridging intermediate draft noise and mask-style endpoint corruption within one Diffusion Transformer architecture.

Result: On OpenWebText, DSL fine-tuning yields large MAUVE gains at low step budgets, surpassing MDLM+ReMDM baseline with ~4x fewer denoiser evaluations, and matches autoregressive quality at high budgets. Shows improved self-correction and uncertainty calibration.

Conclusion: DSL makes remasking sampling markedly more compute-efficient by improving training alone, enabling more efficient non-autoregressive generation through better step-efficiency in masked diffusion language models.

Abstract: Non-autoregressive (NAR) generation reduces decoding latency by predicting many tokens in parallel, but iterative refinement often suffers from error accumulation and distribution shift under self-generated drafts. Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) and their remasking samplers (e.g., ReMDM) can be viewed as modern NAR iterative refinement, where generation repeatedly revises a partially observed draft. In this work we show that \emph{training alone} can substantially improve the step-efficiency of MDLM/ReMDM sampling. We propose \textsc{DSL} (Discrete Stochastic Localization), which trains a single SNR-invariant denoiser across a continuum of corruption levels, bridging intermediate draft noise and mask-style endpoint corruption within one Diffusion Transformer. On OpenWebText, \textsc{DSL} fine-tuning yields large MAUVE gains at low step budgets, surpassing the MDLM+ReMDM baseline with \(\sim\)4$\times$ fewer denoiser evaluations, and matches autoregressive quality at high budgets. Analyses show improved self-correction and uncertainty calibration, making remasking markedly more compute-efficient.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy theft threatens smart grid stability and causes economic losses. Traditional centralized ML approaches raise privacy concerns and are unsuitable for resource-constrained smart meters.

Conclusion: The proposed solution is practical and scalable for secure energy theft detection in next-generation smart grid infrastructures, addressing both privacy and computational constraints.

Abstract: Energy theft poses a significant threat to the stability and efficiency of smart grids, leading to substantial economic losses and operational challenges. Traditional centralized machine learning approaches for theft detection require aggregating user data, raising serious concerns about privacy and data security. These issues are further exacerbated in smart meter environments, where devices are often resource-constrained and lack the capacity to run heavy models. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection that addresses both privacy and computational constraints. Our approach leverages a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, suitable for deployment on low-power smart meters, and integrates basic differential privacy (DP) by injecting Gaussian noise into local model updates before aggregation. This ensures formal privacy guarantees without compromising learning performance. We evaluate our framework on a real-world smart meter dataset under both IID and non-IID data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores while maintaining privacy and efficiency. This makes the proposed solution practical and scalable for secure energy theft detection in next-generation smart grid infrastructures.

*Filippos Bellos,NaveenJohn Premkumar,Yannis Avrithis,Nam H. Nguyen,Jason J. Corso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TPC introduces temporal-prior conditioning to treat time as a first-class modality in LLM-for-time-series models, using learnable time tokens and cross-attention to temporal embeddings at multiple layers, achieving SOTA in long-term forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-for-time-series methods treat time shallowly by injecting positional or prompt-based cues only at the input, which limits temporal reasoning as this information degrades through the layers.

Method: Temporal-Prior Conditioning (TPC) attaches learnable time series tokens to the patch stream; at selected layers these tokens cross-attend to temporal embeddings derived from human-readable temporal descriptors encoded by the same frozen LLM, then feed temporal context back via self-attention.

Result: TPC consistently outperforms both full fine-tuning and shallow conditioning strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: By treating time as a first-class modality and disentangling time series signal from temporal information while maintaining low parameter budget, TPC enables better temporal reasoning in LLM-for-time-series models.

Abstract: LLM-for-time series (TS) methods typically treat time shallowly, injecting positional or prompt-based cues once at the input of a largely frozen decoder, which limits temporal reasoning as this information degrades through the layers. We introduce Temporal-Prior Conditioning (TPC), which elevates time to a first-class modality that conditions the model at multiple depths. TPC attaches a small set of learnable time series tokens to the patch stream; at selected layers these tokens cross-attend to temporal embeddings derived from compact, human-readable temporal descriptors encoded by the same frozen LLM, then feed temporal context back via self-attention. This disentangles time series signal and temporal information while maintaining a low parameter budget. We show that by training only the cross-attention modules and explicitly disentangling time series signal and temporal information, TPC consistently outperforms both full fine-tuning and shallow conditioning strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: GC-PINN introduces geometric compactification mappings to reshape input coordinates, addressing gradient stiffness in PINNs caused by geometric misalignment with multi-scale PDE structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PINNs struggle with multi-scale PDEs containing both smooth low-frequency and localized high-frequency structures. Fixed coordinate inputs cause geometric misalignment leading to gradient stiffness and ill-conditioning that hinder convergence.

Method: Proposes GC-PINN framework using differentiable geometric compactification mappings to reshape input coordinates. Three mapping strategies for: 1) periodic boundaries, 2) far-field scale expansion, and 3) localized singular structures. Works without modifying underlying PINN architecture.

Result: Extensive empirical evaluation shows more uniform residual distributions, higher solution accuracy on 1D/2D PDEs, improved training stability, and faster convergence speed compared to standard PINNs.

Conclusion: Geometric compactification mapping paradigm successfully addresses gradient stiffness in PINNs by coupling geometric structure of PDEs with spectral properties of residual operators, enabling better handling of multi-scale problems.

Abstract: Several complex physical systems are governed by multi-scale partial differential equations (PDEs) that exhibit both smooth low-frequency components and localized high-frequency structures. Existing physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods typically train with fixed coordinate system inputs, where geometric misalignment with these structures induces gradient stiffness and ill-conditioning that hinder convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a mapping paradigm that reshapes the input coordinates through differentiable geometric compactification mappings and couples the geometric structure of PDEs with the spectral properties of residual operators. Based on this paradigm, we propose Geometric Compactification (GC)-PINN, a framework that introduces three mapping strategies for periodic boundaries, far-field scale expansion, and localized singular structures in the input domain without modifying the underlying PINN architecture. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that this approach yields more uniform residual distributions and higher solution accuracy on representative 1D and 2D PDEs, while improving training stability and convergence speed.

TL;DR: GMFS is a Graphon Mean-Field Subsampling framework for scalable cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning with heterogeneous agent interactions, achieving near-optimal performance with polynomial sample complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mean-field methods assume homogeneous agent interactions, while graphon-based approaches capture heterogeneity but become computationally expensive as the number of agents grows. There's a need for scalable MARL methods that handle heterogeneous interactions efficiently.

Method: GMFS subsamples κ agents according to interaction strength to approximate the graphon-weighted mean-field. This reduces computational complexity while maintaining the ability to capture heterogeneous interactions through graphon-based modeling.

Result: The framework achieves sample complexity polynomial in κ and optimality gap O(1/√κ). Numerical simulations in robotic coordination demonstrate that GMFS achieves near-optimal performance while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: GMFS provides a scalable solution for cooperative MARL with heterogeneous agent interactions, bridging the gap between mean-field methods (efficient but homogeneous) and graphon-based approaches (heterogeneous but expensive).

Abstract: Coordinating large populations of interacting agents is a central challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the size of the joint state-action space scales exponentially with the number of agents. Mean-field methods alleviate this burden by aggregating agent interactions, but these approaches assume homogeneous interactions. Recent graphon-based frameworks capture heterogeneity, but are computationally expensive as the number of agents grows. Therefore, we introduce $\texttt{GMFS}$, a $\textbf{G}$raphon $\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield $\textbf{S}$ubsampling framework for scalable cooperative MARL with heterogeneous agent interactions. By subsampling $κ$ agents according to interaction strength, we approximate the graphon-weighted mean-field and learn a policy with sample complexity $\mathrm{poly}(κ)$ and optimality gap $O(1/\sqrtκ)$. We verify our theory with numerical simulations in robotic coordination, showing that $\texttt{GMFS}$ achieves near-optimal performance.

Abstract: Multimodal systems are vulnerable to partial or complete loss of input channels at deployment, which undermines reliability in real-world settings.

TL;DR: DOIT is a training-free adaptation method for diffusion models that uses Doob's h-transform to steer sampling toward high-reward distributions without modifying the pre-trained model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptation methods for diffusion models either require expensive training, rely on differentiable rewards, or lack theoretical guarantees. There's a need for efficient, training-free methods that work with generic non-differentiable rewards.

Method: DOIT uses a measure transport formulation to transport pre-trained generative distributions to high-reward target distributions. It leverages Doob's h-transform to induce dynamic corrections to the diffusion sampling process, enabling simulation-based computation without model modification.

Result: Theoretically, DOIT provides high probability convergence guarantees to target distributions. Empirically, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on D4RL offline RL benchmarks while preserving sampling efficiency.

Conclusion: DOIT offers an efficient, training-free adaptation method for diffusion models that works with non-differentiable rewards, provides theoretical guarantees, and demonstrates strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Adaptation methods have been a workhorse for unlocking the transformative power of pre-trained diffusion models in diverse applications. Existing approaches often abstract adaptation objectives as a reward function and steer diffusion models to generate high-reward samples. However, these approaches can incur high computational overhead due to additional training, or rely on stringent assumptions on the reward such as differentiability. Moreover, despite their empirical success, theoretical justification and guarantees are seldom established. In this paper, we propose DOIT (Doob-Oriented Inference-time Transformation), a training-free and computationally efficient adaptation method that applies to generic, non-differentiable rewards. The key framework underlying our method is a measure transport formulation that seeks to transport the pre-trained generative distribution to a high-reward target distribution. We leverage Doob's $h$-transform to realize this transport, which induces a dynamic correction to the diffusion sampling process and enables efficient simulation-based computation without modifying the pre-trained model. Theoretically, we establish a high probability convergence guarantee to the target high-reward distribution via characterizing the approximation error in the dynamic Doob's correction. Empirically, on D4RL offline RL benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while preserving sampling efficiency.

Motivation: NL has shown advantages over deep learning (small training samples, low compute) but hasn't been applied to linked data/knowledge graphs yet. The paper aims to extend NL to this important data structure.

Method: Implement node aggregation on knowledge graphs to extract features, then feed these aggregated node features to ChaosNet (the simplest NL architecture). Test on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets.

Result: The approach demonstrates better efficacy on homophilic graphs compared to heterophilic graphs. Performance varies with the degree of heterophily in the datasets.

Conclusion: NL can be successfully applied to knowledge graphs via node aggregation, with promising results especially for homophilic graphs. The paper includes analysis and suggestions for future work to improve performance on heterophilic graphs.

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) has shown promise in recent times over traditional deep learning due to its two key features: ability to learn from small sized training samples, and low compute requirements. In prior work, NL has been implemented and extensively tested on separable and time series data, and demonstrated its superior performance on both classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we investigate the next step in NL, viz., applying NL to linked data, in particular, data that is represented in the form of knowledge graphs. We integrate linked data into NL by implementing node aggregation on knowledge graphs, and then feeding the aggregated node features to the simplest NL architecture: ChaosNet. We demonstrate the results of our implementation on homophilic graph datasets as well as heterophilic graph datasets of verying heterophily. We show better efficacy of our approach on homophilic graphs than on heterophilic graphs. While doing so, we also present our analysis of the results, as well as suggestions for future work.

Motivation: Existing neural operators suffer from instability in multi-layer iteration and long-horizon rollout due to unconstrained Euclidean latent space updates that violate geometric and conservation laws of physical systems.

Method: Proposes MCL (Manifold Constraining based on Lie group) - a plug-and-play module that constrains manifolds with low-rank Lie algebra parameterization, performing group action updates on latent representations to enforce geometric inductive bias.

Result: Extensive experiments on 1-D Burgers and 2-D Navier-Stokes equations show MCL reduces relative prediction error by 30-50% with only 2.26% parameter increase, effectively improving long-term prediction fidelity.

Conclusion: MCL provides a scalable solution for improving neural operator stability by addressing the principled geometric constraints absent in standard neural operator updates, enabling better long-term predictions for physical systems.

Abstract: Neural operators offer an effective framework for learning solutions of partial differential equations for many physical systems in a resolution-invariant and data-driven manner. Existing neural operators, however, often suffer from instability in multi-layer iteration and long-horizon rollout, which stems from the unconstrained Euclidean latent space updates that violate the geometric and conservation laws. To address this challenge, we propose to constrain manifolds with low-rank Lie algebra parameterization that performs group action updates on the latent representation. Our method, termed Manifold Constraining based on Lie group (MCL), acts as an efficient \emph{plug-and-play} module that enforces geometric inductive bias to existing neural operators. Extensive experiments on various partial differential equations, such as 1-D Burgers and 2-D Navier-Stokes, over a wide range of parameters and steps demonstrate that our method effectively lowers the relative prediction error by 30-50\% at the cost of 2.26\% of parameter increase. The results show that our approach provides a scalable solution for improving long-term prediction fidelity by addressing the principled geometric constraints absent in the neural operator updates.

Abstract: Surface extraction from implicit neural representations modelling a single class surface is a well-known task. However, there exist no surface extraction methods from an implicit representation of multiple classes that guarantee topological correctness and no holes. In this work, we lay the groundwork by introducing a 2D boundary extraction algorithm for the multi-class case focusing on topological consistency and water-tightness, which also allows for setting minimum detail restraint on the approximation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm using geological modelling data, showcasing its adaptiveness and ability to honour complex topology.

*Maren Mahsereci,Toni Karvonen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of Bayesian quadrature covering mathematical foundations, taxonomy, theoretical guarantees, numerical studies, practical challenges, and extensive bibliography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian quadrature is a probabilistic approach to numerical integration that has been used since the 1980s but lacks a systematic and comprehensive treatment in the literature.

Method: The survey reviews mathematical foundations from different perspectives, creates a taxonomy along three axes (modelling, inference, sampling), collects theoretical guarantees, and conducts controlled numerical studies.

Result: Provides a systematic framework for understanding Bayesian quadrature methods, explores effects of different choices in the taxonomy, and identifies practical challenges and limitations.

Conclusion: This survey fills a significant gap in the literature by providing the first comprehensive treatment of Bayesian quadrature, covering its foundations, methods, applications, and limitations across multiple disciplines.

Abstract: Bayesian quadrature is a probabilistic, model-based approach to numerical integration, the estimation of intractable integrals, or expectations. Although Bayesian quadrature was popularised already in the 1980s, no systematic and comprehensive treatment has been published. The purpose of this survey is to fill this gap. We review the mathematical foundations of Bayesian quadrature from different points of view; present a systematic taxonomy for classifying different Bayesian quadrature methods along the three axes of modelling, inference, and sampling; collect general theoretical guarantees; and provide a controlled numerical study that explores and illustrates the effect of different choices along the axes of the taxonomy. We also provide a realistic assessment of practical challenges and limitations to application of Bayesian quadrature methods and include an up-to-date and nearly exhaustive bibliography that covers not only machine learning and statistics literature but all areas of mathematics and engineering in which Bayesian quadrature or equivalent methods have seen use.

*Xu Zhang,Qitong Wang,Peng Wang,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEMixer: Lightweight multiscale model for long-term time series forecasting using Random Attention Mechanism and Multiscale Progressive Mixing Chain to address semantic gaps and noise in multiscale patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiscale pattern modeling is crucial for long-term time series forecasting, but redundancy/noise in time series and semantic gaps between non-adjacent scales make efficient alignment and integration of multi-scale dependencies challenging.

Method: Proposes SEMixer with two key components: 1) Random Attention Mechanism (RAM) that captures diverse time-patch interactions during training and aggregates them via dropout ensemble at inference, and 2) Multiscale Progressive Mixing Chain (MPMC) that stacks RAM and MLP-Mixer in a memory-efficient manner for effective temporal mixing.

Result: Validated on 10 public datasets and the 2025 CCF AlOps Challenge based on 21GB real wireless network data, where SEMixer achieved third place. The method enhances patch-level semantics and enables better multiscale modeling.

Conclusion: SEMixer effectively addresses semantic gaps across scales and facilitates better multiscale modeling and forecasting performance through its lightweight architecture combining RAM and MPMC components.

Abstract: Modeling multiscale patterns is crucial for long-term time series forecasting (TSF). However, redundancy and noise in time series, together with semantic gaps between non-adjacent scales, make the efficient alignment and integration of multi-scale temporal dependencies challenging. To address this, we propose SEMixer, a lightweight multiscale model designed for long-term TSF. SEMixer features two key components: a Random Attention Mechanism (RAM) and a Multiscale Progressive Mixing Chain (MPMC). RAM captures diverse time-patch interactions during training and aggregates them via dropout ensemble at inference, enhancing patch-level semantics and enabling MLP-Mixer to better model multi-scale dependencies. MPMC further stacks RAM and MLP-Mixer in a memory-efficient manner, achieving more effective temporal mixing. It addresses semantic gaps across scales and facilitates better multiscale modeling and forecasting performance. We not only validate the effectiveness of SEMixer on 10 public datasets, but also on the \textit{2025 CCF AlOps Challenge} based on 21GB real wireless network data, where SEMixer achieves third place.

### [182] [Amortized Predictability-aware Training Framework for Time Series Forecasting and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16224)
*Xu Zhang,Peng Wang,Yichen Li,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APTF is a training framework that identifies and penalizes low-predictability samples in time series data to improve forecasting and classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series data often contain noisy, low-predictability patterns that deviate from normal distributions, causing training instability and poor convergence in deep learning models. Existing models rarely address how to identify and penalize these problematic samples during training.

Method: Proposes APTF with two key components: 1) Hierarchical Predictability-aware Loss (HPL) that dynamically identifies low-predictability samples and progressively increases their loss penalty during training, and 2) an amortization model that reduces predictability estimation errors caused by model bias.

Result: The framework enables models to focus on high-predictability samples while still learning appropriately from low-predictability ones, improving performance for both time series forecasting and classification tasks.

Conclusion: APTF provides a general training framework that addresses the critical issue of low-predictability samples in time series analysis, offering a novel approach to improve model stability and performance through predictability-aware training.

Abstract: Time series data are prone to noise in various domains, and training samples may contain low-predictability patterns that deviate from the normal data distribution, leading to training instability or convergence to poor local minima. Therefore, mitigating the adverse effects of low-predictability samples is crucial for time series analysis tasks such as time series forecasting (TSF) and time series classification (TSC). While many deep learning models have achieved promising performance, few consider how to identify and penalize low-predictability samples to improve model performance from the training perspective. To fill this gap, we propose a general Amortized Predictability-aware Training Framework (APTF) for both TSF and TSC. APTF introduces two key designs that enable the model to focus on high-predictability samples while still learning appropriately from low-predictability ones: (i) a Hierarchical Predictability-aware Loss (HPL) that dynamically identifies low-predictability samples and progressively expands their loss penalty as training evolves, and (ii) an amortization model that mitigates predictability estimation errors caused by model bias, further enhancing HPL's effectiveness.

*Zizhao Wang,Chang Shi,Jiaheng Hu,Kevin Rohling,Roberto Martín-Martín,Amy Zhang,Peter Stone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLAM introduces a factored dynamics framework that decomposes scenes into independent factors with separate latent actions, improving multi-entity video generation and control compared to monolithic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent action approaches use monolithic models that learn single latent actions for entire scenes, which struggle in complex environments with multiple simultaneous entities acting independently.

Method: FLAM decomposes scenes into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value, creating a factorized structure for modeling multi-entity dynamics.

Result: FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, and facilitates downstream policy learning.

Conclusion: Factorized latent action models provide benefits over monolithic approaches for complex multi-entity environments, enabling more accurate dynamics modeling and improved video generation quality.

Abstract: Learning latent actions from action-free video has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling up controllable world model learning. Latent actions provide a natural interface for users to iteratively generate and manipulate videos. However, most existing approaches rely on monolithic inverse and forward dynamics models that learn a single latent action to control the entire scene, and therefore struggle in complex environments where multiple entities act simultaneously. This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models. Based on experiments on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, we find that FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality, and facilitates downstream policy learning, demonstrating the benefits of factorized latent action models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First supervised classification framework with class-dependent rewards (CDR) for predicting ≥M-class solar flares within 24 hours, using both knowledge-informed features and magnetogram data with deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an improved solar flare prediction system that addresses class imbalance through class-dependent rewards and leverages both traditional physical features and modern deep learning approaches.

Method: Constructed multiple datasets with knowledge-informed features and line-of-sight magnetograms. Applied three deep learning models (CNN, CNN-BiLSTM, Transformer) and their CDR counterparts. Conducted feature importance analysis, performance comparisons, sensitivity analysis on reward engineering, SHAP interpretability analysis, and comparison with NASA/CCMC.

Result: (1) R_VALUE and AREA_ACR are most important LOS features; (2) Combined LOS+vector magnetic field data works best; (3) Knowledge-informed features outperform magnetograms; (4) CDR-Transformer achieves best overall performance; (5) CDR models robust to reward choices; (6) Different feature importance patterns between CDR and Transformer; (7) CDR-Transformer outperforms NASA/CCMC.

Conclusion: The CDR-Transformer framework represents a significant advancement in solar flare prediction, effectively handling class imbalance and achieving state-of-the-art performance by combining knowledge-informed features with advanced deep learning architectures.

Abstract: In this work, we develop, for the first time, a supervised classification framework with class-dependent rewards (CDR) to predict $\geq$MM flares within 24 hr. We construct multiple datasets, covering knowledge-informed features and line-of sight (LOS) magnetograms. We also apply three deep learning models (CNN, CNN-BiLSTM, and Transformer) and three CDR counterparts (CDR-CNN, CDR-CNN-BiLSTM, and CDR-Transformer). First, we analyze the importance of LOS magnetic field parameters with the Transformer, then compare its performance using LOS-only, vector-only, and combined magnetic field parameters. Second, we compare flare prediction performance based on CDR models versus deep learning counterparts. Third, we perform sensitivity analysis on reward engineering for CDR models. Fourth, we use the SHAP method for model interpretability. Finally, we conduct performance comparison between our models and NASA/CCMC. The main findings are: (1)Among LOS feature combinations, R_VALUE and AREA_ACR consistently yield the best results. (2)Transformer achieves better performance with combined LOS and vector magnetic field data than with either alone. (3)Models using knowledge-informed features outperform those using magnetograms. (4)While CNN and CNN-BiLSTM outperform their CDR counterparts on magnetograms, CDR-Transformer is slightly superior to its deep learning counterpart when using knowledge-informed features. Among all models, CDR-Transformer achieves the best performance. (5)The predictive performance of the CDR models is not overly sensitive to the reward choices.(6)Through SHAP analysis, the CDR model tends to regard TOTUSJH as more important, while the Transformer tends to prioritize R_VALUE more.(7)Under identical prediction time and active region (AR) number, the CDR-Transformer shows superior predictive capabilities compared to NASA/CCMC.

TL;DR: First high-probability regret bound for classical online Q-learning in infinite-horizon discounted MDPs without optimism/bonus terms, showing gap-dependent and gap-robust results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous regret bounds for Q-learning typically rely on optimism or bonus terms. The authors aim to provide the first high-probability regret analysis for classical online Q-learning without these mechanisms, focusing on understanding how regret depends on the MDP's suboptimality gap.

Method: Analyze two algorithms: 1) Boltzmann Q-learning with decaying temperature, showing gap-dependent regret; 2) Smoothed ε_n-Greedy exploration combining ε-greedy and Boltzmann, achieving gap-robust regret. Develop novel concentration bound for contractive Markovian stochastic approximation with iterate- and time-dependent dynamics.

Result: For Boltzmann Q-learning: regret is sublinear for large suboptimality gaps but deteriorates to near-linear for small gaps. For Smoothed ε_n-Greedy: achieve gap-robust regret bound of near-Õ(N^{9/10}). Provide new concentration bound with contraction factor governed by mixing time, allowed to converge to one asymptotically.

Conclusion: First high-probability regret analysis for classical online Q-learning without optimism/bonus terms, revealing gap-dependent behavior and proposing gap-robust algorithm. The developed concentration bound for contractive Markovian stochastic approximation has independent theoretical interest.

Abstract: We present the first high-probability regret bound for classical online Q-learning in infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision processes, without relying on optimism or bonus terms. We first analyze Boltzmann Q-learning with decaying temperature and show that its regret depends critically on the suboptimality gap of the MDP: for sufficiently large gaps, the regret is sublinear, while for small gaps it deteriorates and can approach linear growth. To address this limitation, we study a Smoothed $ε_n$-Greedy exploration scheme that combines $ε_n$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration, for which we prove a gap-robust regret bound of near-$\tilde{O}(N^{9/10})$. To analyze these algorithms, we develop a high-probability concentration bound for contractive Markovian stochastic approximation with iterate- and time-dependent transition dynamics. This bound may be of independent interest as the contraction factor in our bound is governed by the mixing time and is allowed to converge to one asymptotically.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WS-KAN is the first weight-space architecture designed for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that accounts for their permutation symmetries, outperforming structure-agnostic baselines across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While weight-space models exist for standard networks like MLPs, no analogous architecture exists for KANs despite their growing importance. Current naive methods perform poorly, creating a need for specialized weight-space architectures that understand KANs' structural properties.

Method: The authors show KANs share the same permutation symmetries as MLPs, propose KAN-graph (a graph representation of KAN computation), and develop WS-KAN - the first weight-space architecture for KANs that naturally accounts for their symmetry. They analyze its expressive power and create a comprehensive "zoo" of trained KANs for benchmarking.

Result: WS-KAN consistently outperforms structure-agnostic baselines across all tasks, often by substantial margins. The architecture can replicate an input KAN's forward pass, demonstrating strong expressive power.

Conclusion: The work successfully develops the first weight-space architecture for KANs that leverages their permutation symmetries, establishing a foundation for weight-space learning on KANs and providing valuable benchmarks through the KAN "zoo".

Abstract: Weight-space models learn directly from the parameters of neural networks, enabling tasks such as predicting their accuracy on new datasets. Naive methods -- like applying MLPs to flattened parameters -- perform poorly, making the design of better weight-space architectures a central challenge. While prior work leveraged permutation symmetries in standard networks to guide such designs, no analogous analysis or tailored architecture yet exists for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). In this work, we show that KANs share the same permutation symmetries as MLPs, and propose the KAN-graph, a graph representation of their computation. Building on this, we develop WS-KAN, the first weight-space architecture that learns on KANs, which naturally accounts for their symmetry. We analyze WS-KAN's expressive power, showing it can replicate an input KAN's forward pass - a standard approach for assessing expressiveness in weight-space architectures. We construct a comprehensive ``zoo'' of trained KANs spanning diverse tasks, which we use as benchmarks to empirically evaluate WS-KAN. Across all tasks, WS-KAN consistently outperforms structure-agnostic baselines, often by a substantial margin. Our code is available at https://github.com/BarSGuy/KAN-Graph-Metanetwork.

*Adam Zweiger,Xinghong Fu,Han Guo,Yoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fast context compaction in latent space via Attention Matching achieves 50x KV cache compression with minimal quality loss, solving the slow optimization problem of previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling language models to long contexts is bottlenecked by KV cache size. Current summarization methods are lossy and harm performance, while recent latent space methods require slow, expensive optimization.

Method: Attention Matching constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at per-KV-head level. The formulation decomposes into simple subproblems with efficient closed-form solutions.

Result: Achieves up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss, significantly improving the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality.

Conclusion: Attention Matching enables fast, high-quality context compaction in latent space, overcoming the optimization bottlenecks of previous methods while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Scaling language models to long contexts is often bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache. In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level. We show that this formulation naturally decomposes into simple subproblems, some of which admit efficient closed-form solutions. Within this framework, we develop a family of methods that significantly push the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality, achieving up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss.

As the field advances and grows, new concerns present themselves in the ability to predict the off-target behavior. In this work, we explore the underlying biological and chemical model from a data driven perspective. Additionally, we present a machine learning based solution named \textit{Guide-Guard} to predict the behavior of the system given a gRNA in the CRISPR gene-editing process with 84\% accuracy. This solution is able to be trained on multiple different genes at the same time while retaining accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient exploration of approximate computing configurations in DNN accelerators, as exhaustive search becomes computationally prohibitive for large networks with heterogeneous approximate blocks.

Method: Multi-level sensitivity scoring at operator, filter, layer, and model abstraction levels to guide selective integration of approximate blocks, supported by predictive models for accuracy, power, and area evaluation.

Result: Achieves over 23x speedup in layer-level search and more than 3 million times speedup in filter-level search for LeNet-5, with exponential scaling benefits for larger networks like VGG-11, ResNet-18, and EfficientNetLite.

Conclusion: HAWX provides a scalable hardware-aware exploration framework that dramatically accelerates approximate computing configuration search while maintaining accuracy, supporting both spatial and temporal accelerator architectures with off-the-shelf or custom approximate components.

Abstract: This work presents HAWX, a hardware-aware scalable exploration framework that employs multi-level sensitivity scoring at different DNN abstraction levels (operator, filter, layer, and model) to guide selective integration of heterogeneous AxC blocks. Supported by predictive models for accuracy, power, and area, HAWX accelerates the evaluation of candidate configurations, achieving over 23* speedup in a layer-level search with two candidate approximate blocks and more than (3*106)* speedup at the filter-level search only for LeNet-5, while maintaining accuracy comparable to exhaustive search. Experiments across state-of-the-art DNN benchmarks such as VGG-11, ResNet-18, and EfficientNetLite demonstrate that the efficiency benefits of HAWX scale exponentially with network size. The HAWX hardware-aware search algorithm supports both spatial and temporal accelerator architectures, leveraging either off-the-shelf approximate components or customized designs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Momentum-based optimizers (Muon, MomentumGD, Signum, Adam) exhibit implicit bias toward KKT points of margin maximization problems in homogeneous models, with the specific margin norm depending on the optimizer choice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the implicit bias of momentum-based optimizers in homogeneous models, extending existing results from steepest descent to momentum variants and Adam, and to determine which margin maximization problem each optimizer solves.

Method: Extend existing steepest descent results to normalized steepest descent with learning rate schedules. Show that momentum steepest descent algorithms (Muon, MomentumGD, Signum) approximate steepest descent trajectories under decaying learning rates. Extend analysis to Adam (without stability constant) and hybrid variants (Muon-Signum, Muon-Adam). Provide theoretical proofs and experimental validation.

Result: Momentum-based optimizers have implicit bias toward KKT points of corresponding margin maximization problems: Muon maximizes spectral norm margin, MomentumGD maximizes ℓ₂ margin, Signum maximizes ℓ∞ margin, Adam maximizes ℓ∞ margin, and hybrid variants maximize hybrid norms. Experiments confirm optimizer choice determines which margin is maximized.

Conclusion: The work extends implicit bias analysis from steepest descent to momentum-based optimizers in homogeneous models, showing each optimizer biases toward KKT points of specific margin maximization problems, with the margin norm determined by optimizer choice.

Abstract: We study the implicit bias of momentum-based optimizers on homogeneous models. We first extend existing results on the implicit bias of steepest descent in homogeneous models to normalized steepest descent with an optional learning rate schedule. We then show that for smooth homogeneous models, momentum steepest descent algorithms like Muon (spectral norm), MomentumGD ($\ell_2$ norm), and Signum ($\ell_\infty$ norm) are approximate steepest descent trajectories under a decaying learning rate schedule, proving that these algorithms too have a bias towards KKT points of the corresponding margin maximization problem. We extend the analysis to Adam (without the stability constant), which maximizes the $\ell_\infty$ margin, and to Muon-Signum and Muon-Adam, which maximize a hybrid norm. Our experiments corroborate the theory and show that the identity of the margin maximized depends on the choice of optimizer. Overall, our results extend earlier lines of work on steepest descent in homogeneous models and momentum-based optimizers in linear models.

TL;DR: Comparison of Integrated Gradients and SHAP XAI methods for explaining LSTM fault diagnosis decisions in Tennessee Eastman Process, showing both methods identify similar important features but SHAP sometimes provides more informative root cause analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To apply and compare state-of-the-art XAI methods (IG and SHAP) for explaining fault diagnosis decisions made by an LSTM classifier in industrial process monitoring, specifically to identify which process subsystems are affected by faults.

Method: Used two model-agnostic XAI methods (Integrated Gradients and SHAP) to explain decisions of a highly accurate LSTM classifier trained for fault detection in the benchmark Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). The methods were applied to identify important features contributing to fault diagnosis decisions.

Result: Both XAI methods generally identified the same features as most important for fault diagnosis decisions. However, in some cases, SHAP provided more informative explanations that were closer to the actual root cause of the faults, helping to identify the specific subsystems where faults occurred.

Conclusion: XAI methods like IG and SHAP are valuable for interpreting complex LSTM fault diagnosis models in industrial processes. The proposed approach is model-agnostic and can be applied to similar fault diagnosis problems beyond the specific Tennessee Eastman Process studied.

Abstract: In this work, we apply and compare two state-of-the-art eXplainability Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, the Integrated Gradients (IG) and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), that explain the fault diagnosis decisions of a highly accurate Long Short-Time Memory (LSTM) classifier. The classifier is trained to detect faults in a benchmark non-linear chemical process, the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). It is highlighted how XAI methods can help identify the subsystem of the process where the fault occurred. Using our knowledge of the process, we note that in most cases the same features are indicated as the most important for the decision, while insome cases the SHAP method seems to be more informative and closer to the root cause of the fault. Finally, since the used XAI methods are model-agnostic, the proposed approach is not limited to the specific process and can also be used in similar problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate estimation of chromophore concentrations in spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging is crucial for revealing structural, functional, and molecular information about physiological processes, but current methods are limited by nonlinearities and ill-posedness.

Method: Developed Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Optical Inversion Autoencoder (SPOI-AE) that addresses both optical inversion and spectral unmixing problems without assuming linearity, trained and tested on in vivo mouse lymph node sPA images.

Result: SPOI-AE outperforms conventional algorithms in reconstructing input sPA pixels while providing biologically coherent estimates for optical parameters, chromophore concentrations, and tissue oxygen saturation. Validation with simulated phantom ground truth confirms unmixing accuracy.

Conclusion: SPOI-AE successfully addresses the intractable concentration estimation problem in spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging by overcoming nonlinearities and ill-posedness, providing accurate and biologically meaningful results without linearity assumptions.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of the relative concentrations of chromophores in a spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) image can reveal immense structural, functional, and molecular information about physiological processes. However, due to nonlinearities and ill-posedness inherent to sPA imaging, concentration estimation is intractable. The Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Optical Inversion Autoencoder (SPOI-AE) aims to address the sPA optical inversion and spectral unmixing problems without assuming linearity. Herein, SPOI-AE was trained and tested on \textit{in vivo} mouse lymph node sPA images with unknown ground truth chromophore concentrations. SPOI-AE better reconstructs input sPA pixels than conventional algorithms while providing biologically coherent estimates for optical parameters, chromophore concentrations, and the percent oxygen saturation of tissue. SPOI-AE's unmixing accuracy was validated using a simulated mouse lymph node phantom ground truth.

*Eva Paraschou,Line Harder Clemmensen,Sneha Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Targeted gender alignment in LLMs causes bias spillover, worsening fairness on other attributes like physical appearance, sexual orientation, and disability, especially in ambiguous contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM fairness alignment focuses on single attributes, ignoring multidimensional fairness and context-specific values, risking bias spillover where improving one attribute worsens others.

Method: Used Direct Preference Optimization on three LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B) with BBQ benchmark to evaluate fairness across nine sensitive attributes in ambiguous and disambiguous contexts.

Result: While aggregate results showed improvements, context-aware analysis revealed significant bias spillover in ambiguous contexts, with notable degradations for physical appearance (p<0.001 across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status.

Conclusion: Improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the need for context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks in LLM alignment.

Abstract: Conventional large language model (LLM) fairness alignment largely focuses on mitigating bias along single sensitive attributes, overlooking fairness as an inherently multidimensional and context-specific value. This approach risks creating systems that achieve narrow fairness metrics while exacerbating disparities along untargeted attributes, a phenomenon known as bias spillover. While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks.

<details>

Motivation: Previous work on reward-agnostic exploration achieved minimax sample complexity but only for restrictively small accuracy parameters ε. There's a need to relax this requirement to make the approach more practical and applicable to a wider range of scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a novel algorithm that uses an online learning procedure with carefully designed rewards to construct an exploration policy. This policy gathers sufficient data for accurate dynamics estimation, enabling computation of an ε-optimal policy once the actual reward is revealed.

Result: The algorithm significantly relaxes the requirement on ε for reward-agnostic exploration while maintaining sample efficiency. Additionally, the paper establishes a tight lower bound for reward-free exploration, closing the gap between known upper and lower bounds.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm advances reward-agnostic exploration by making it more practical through relaxed accuracy requirements, and the tight lower bound provides theoretical completeness for reward-free exploration in finite-horizon MDPs.

Abstract: We study reward-free and reward-agnostic exploration in episodic finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs), where an agent explores an unknown environment without observing external rewards. Reward-free exploration aims to enable $ε$-optimal policies for any reward revealed after exploration, while reward-agnostic exploration targets $ε$-optimality for rewards drawn from a small finite class. In the reward-agnostic setting, Li, Yan, Chen, and Fan achieve minimax sample complexity, but only for restrictively small accuracy parameter $ε$. We propose a new algorithm that significantly relaxes the requirement on $ε$. Our approach is novel and of technical interest by itself. Our algorithm employs an online learning procedure with carefully designed rewards to construct an exploration policy, which is used to gather data sufficient for accurate dynamics estimation and subsequent computation of an $ε$-optimal policy once the reward is revealed. Finally, we establish a tight lower bound for reward-free exploration, closing the gap between known upper and lower bounds.

Conclusion: The FPGA implementation of event-graph neural networks provides an efficient, low-latency, and energy-conscious solution for edge audio processing, establishing strong benchmarks for event-driven keyword spotting systems.

Abstract: As the volume of data recorded by embedded edge sensors increases, particularly from neuromorphic devices producing discrete event streams, there is a growing need for hardware-aware neural architectures that enable efficient, low-latency, and energy-conscious local processing. We present an FPGA implementation of event-graph neural networks for audio processing. We utilise an artificial cochlea that converts time-series signals into sparse event data, reducing memory and computation costs. Our architecture was implemented on a SoC FPGA and evaluated on two open-source datasets. For classification task, our baseline floating-point model achieves 92.7% accuracy on SHD dataset - only 2.4% below the state of the art - while requiring over 10x and 67x fewer parameters. On SSC, our models achieve 66.9-71.0% accuracy. Compared to FPGA-based spiking neural networks, our quantised model reaches 92.3% accuracy, outperforming them by up to 19.3% while reducing resource usage and latency. For SSC, we report the first hardware-accelerated evaluation. We further demonstrate the first end-to-end FPGA implementation of event-audio keyword spotting, combining graph convolutional layers with recurrent sequence modelling. The system achieves up to 95% word-end detection accuracy, with only 10.53 microsecond latency and 1.18 W power consumption, establishing a strong benchmark for energy-efficient event-driven KWS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a bias-correction method for noninteractive LDP data using Weierstrass transform inversion, leading to IWP-SGD algorithm that converges to true population risk minimizer with O(1/n) rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noninteractive Local Differential Privacy (LDP) enables data reusability but introduces noise that creates bias in subsequent analyses, particularly in binary classification tasks.

Method: Leverages Weierstrass transform to characterize LDP noise bias, inverts this transform for bias correction, and builds Inverse Weierstrass Private SGD (IWP-SGD) algorithm for unbiased estimation.

Result: IWP-SGD converges to true population risk minimizer at O(1/n) rate, validated empirically on binary classification tasks with synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The Weierstrass transform inversion provides effective bias correction for LDP data, enabling unbiased nonlinear function estimation and efficient SGD optimization for binary classification.

Abstract: Releasing data once and for all under noninteractive Local Differential Privacy (LDP) enables complete data reusability, but the resulting noise may create bias in subsequent analyses. In this work, we leverage the Weierstrass transform to characterize this bias in binary classification. We prove that inverting this transform leads to a bias-correction method to compute unbiased estimates of nonlinear functions on examples released under LDP. We then build a novel stochastic gradient descent algorithm called Inverse Weierstrass Private SGD (IWP-SGD). It converges to the true population risk minimizer at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$, with $n$ the number of examples. We empirically validate IWP-SGD on binary classification tasks using synthetic and real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative model evaluation using high-dimensional embeddings suffers from hubness phenomenon, which distorts nearest neighbor relationships and biases distance-based metrics, leading to unreliable assessments.

Method: Introduces Generative ICDM (GICDM), which extends the classical Iterative Contextual Dissimilarity Measure to correct neighborhood estimation for both real and generated data, with a multi-scale extension for improved empirical behavior.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real benchmarks show that GICDM resolves hubness-induced failures, restores reliable metric behavior, and improves alignment with human judgment.

Conclusion: GICDM provides an effective solution to hubness bias in generative model evaluation, offering more reliable and human-aligned assessment metrics.

Abstract: Generative model evaluation commonly relies on high-dimensional embedding spaces to compute distances between samples. We show that dataset representations in these spaces are affected by the hubness phenomenon, which distorts nearest neighbor relationships and biases distance-based metrics. Building on the classical Iterative Contextual Dissimilarity Measure (ICDM), we introduce Generative ICDM (GICDM), a method to correct neighborhood estimation for both real and generated data. We introduce a multi-scale extension to improve empirical behavior.

TL;DR: GoldDiff enables scalable analytical diffusion models by dynamically identifying small "Golden Subsets" of training data needed for inference, achieving 71× speedup while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analytical diffusion models offer mathematical transparency but suffer from prohibitive computational costs - they require scanning the entire training dataset at every timestep, making them impractical for large-scale applications.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that identifies a small "Golden Subset" of relevant training data for each timestep using a coarse-to-fine mechanism, based on the discovery of Posterior Progressive Concentration phenomenon where the effective support shrinks as signal-to-noise ratio increases.

Result: Achieves 71× speedup on AFHQ while matching or outperforming full-scan baselines, and demonstrates the first successful scaling of analytical diffusion to ImageNet-1K, enabling large-scale generative modeling without retraining.

Conclusion: GoldDiff unlocks a scalable, training-free paradigm for large-scale generative modeling by decoupling inference complexity from dataset size, making analytical diffusion models practical for real-world applications while preserving their mathematical interpretability.

Abstract: Analytical diffusion models offer a mathematically transparent path to generative modeling by formulating the denoising score as an empirical-Bayes posterior mean. However, this interpretability comes at a prohibitive cost: the standard formulation necessitates a full-dataset scan at every timestep, scaling linearly with dataset size. In this work, we present the first systematic study addressing this scalability bottleneck. We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Capitalizing on this, we propose Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that decouples inference complexity from dataset size. Instead of static retrieval, GoldDiff uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism to dynamically pinpoint the ''Golden Subset'' for inference. Theoretically, we derive rigorous bounds guaranteeing that our sparse approximation converges to the exact score. Empirically, GoldDiff achieves a $\bf 71 \times$ speedup on AFHQ while matching or achieving even better performance than full-scan baselines. Most notably, we demonstrate the first successful scaling of analytical diffusion to ImageNet-1K, unlocking a scalable, training-free paradigm for large-scale generative modeling.

TL;DR: CALMs balance interpretability of GAMs with accuracy of GA²Ms by allowing multiple univariate shape functions per feature that activate in different regions defined by simple thresholds on interacting features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAMs are interpretable but underfit when interactions exist, while GA²Ms add interactions but sacrifice interpretability and limit model auditing. There's a need for models that balance accuracy and interpretability.

Method: CALMs allow multiple univariate shape functions per feature, each active in different regions defined by simple logical conditions (thresholds) on interacting features. They use a distillation-based training pipeline that identifies homogeneous regions with limited interactions and fits interpretable shape functions via region-aware backfitting.

Result: Experiments on diverse classification and regression tasks show CALMs consistently outperform GAMs and achieve accuracy comparable with GA²Ms.

Conclusion: CALMs offer a compelling trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability, balancing the strengths of both GAMs and GA²Ms.

Abstract: Generalized additive models (GAMs) offer interpretability through independent univariate feature effects but underfit when interactions are present in data. GA$^2$Ms add selected pairwise interactions which improves accuracy, but sacrifices interpretability and limits model auditing. We propose \emph{Conditionally Additive Local Models} (CALMs), a new model class, that balances the interpretability of GAMs with the accuracy of GA$^2$Ms. CALMs allow multiple univariate shape functions per feature, each active in different regions of the input space. These regions are defined independently for each feature as simple logical conditions (thresholds) on the features it interacts with. As a result, effects remain locally additive while varying across subregions to capture interactions. We further propose a principled distillation-based training pipeline that identifies homogeneous regions with limited interactions and fits interpretable shape functions via region-aware backfitting. Experiments on diverse classification and regression tasks show that CALMs consistently outperform GAMs and achieve accuracy comparable with GA$^2$Ms. Overall, CALMs offer a compelling trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven streamflow forecasting models often suffer performance degradation when transitioning from historical reanalysis data to operational forecast products, creating a need for models that can bridge this domain shift.

Method: Two-stage LSTM training: first pre-trained on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis data (1980-2019) to learn hydrological processes, then fine-tuned on operational IFS control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to operational NWP biases and errors.

Result: AIFL achieves median modified KGE' of 0.66 and median NSE of 0.53 on independent test set (2021-2024), competitive with state-of-the-art global systems with exceptional extreme-event detection reliability.

Conclusion: AIFL provides a transparent, reproducible, and operationally robust baseline for global hydrological forecasting, effectively bridging the reanalysis-to-forecast domain shift through innovative two-stage training.

Abstract: Reliable global streamflow forecasting is essential for flood preparedness and water resource management, yet data-driven models often suffer from a performance gap when transitioning from historical reanalysis to operational forecast products. This paper introduces AIFL (Artificial Intelligence for Floods), a deterministic LSTM-based model designed for global daily streamflow forecasting. Trained on 18,588 basins curated from the CARAVAN dataset, AIFL utilises a novel two-stage training strategy to bridge the reanalysis-to-forecast domain shift. The model is first pre-trained on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis (1980-2019) to capture robust hydrological processes, then fine-tuned on operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to the specific error structures and biases of operational numerical weather prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first global model trained end-to-end within the CARAVAN ecosystem. On an independent temporal test set (2021-2024), AIFL achieves high predictive skill with a median modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE') of 0.66 and a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.53. Benchmarking results show that AIFL is highly competitive with current state-of-the-art global systems, achieving comparable accuracy while maintaining a transparent and reproducible forcing pipeline. The model demonstrates exceptional reliability in extreme-event detection, providing a streamlined and operationally robust baseline for the global hydrological community.

TL;DR: LoRSum is a memory-efficient method that bridges the gap between full-step SVDLoRA and standard LoRA fine-tuning by solving LoRA optimization as a proximal sub-problem with alternating least squares, enabling efficient preconditioned gradient descent while maintaining LoRA's parameter efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between training with full steps using low-rank projections (SVDLoRA) and standard LoRA fine-tuning, while maintaining memory efficiency and avoiding expensive full-matrix SVD computations.

Method: Propose LoRSum, which casts LoRA optimization as a proximal sub-problem and solves it efficiently with alternating least squares updates (proven to be an implicit block power method). Also propose a scaled variant for preconditioned gradient descent using structured metrics like K-FAC and Shampoo while storing only diagonals for memory efficiency.

Result: LoRSum matches or improves LoRA baselines on synthetic tasks, CIFAR-100, and language-model fine-tuning (GLUE, SQuAD v2, WikiText-103) with modest compute overhead, while avoiding full-matrix SVD projections and retaining LoRA-style parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: LoRSum provides an efficient bridge between SVDLoRA and standard LoRA, enabling memory-efficient preconditioned gradient descent while recovering several recent preconditioning methods as special cases, making it a practical alternative for fine-tuning large models.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large models by learning low-rank updates on top of frozen weights, dramatically reducing trainable parameters and memory. In this work, we address the gap between training with full steps with low-rank projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning. We propose LoRSum, a memory-efficient subroutine that closes this gap for gradient descent by casting LoRA optimization as a proximal sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates, which we prove to be an implicit block power method. We recover several recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as special cases, and show that LoRSum can also be used for updating a low-rank momentum. In order to address full steps with preconditioned gradient descent, we propose a scaled variant of LoRSum that uses structured metrics such as K-FAC and Shampoo, and we show that storing the diagonal of these metrics still allows them to perform well while remaining memory-efficient. Experiments on a synthetic task, CIFAR-100, and language-model fine-tuning on GLUE, SQuAD v2, and WikiText-103, show that our method can match or improve LoRA baselines given modest compute overhead, while avoiding full-matrix SVD projections and retaining LoRA-style parameter efficiency.

TL;DR: HPMixer is a hierarchical patching mixer for long-term multivariate time series forecasting that decouples periodic and residual components using learnable cycle modules and wavelet transforms with hierarchical patching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively capturing both periodic patterns and residual dynamics is essential for long-term multivariate time series forecasting, but existing approaches may not adequately address these components in a decoupled yet complementary manner within standard deep learning benchmark settings.

Method: Proposes HPMixer with: 1) Periodic component using learnable cycle module enhanced with nonlinear channel-wise MLP; 2) Residual component processed through Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) for stable frequency-domain representations; 3) Channel-mixing encoder for inter-channel dependencies; 4) Two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism for multi-scale residual variations.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks demonstrate that HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent baselines.

Conclusion: HPMixer provides an effective framework for long-term multivariate time series forecasting by integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning.

Abstract: In long-term multivariate time series forecasting, effectively capturing both periodic patterns and residual dynamics is essential. To address this within standard deep learning benchmark settings, we propose the Hierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer), which models periodicity and residuals in a decoupled yet complementary manner. The periodic component utilizes a learnable cycle module [7] enhanced with a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for greater expressiveness. The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework. Extensive experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks demonstrate that HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing interest in large-scale foundation models for neuroimaging data requires understanding the impact of different tokenization strategies for continuous neural time series data, which is currently poorly understood.

Method: Systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models on MEG data, comparing learnable (novel autoencoder-based approach) and non-learnable tokenizers across multiple evaluation criteria.

Result: Both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria on three public MEG datasets.

Conclusion: Simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be effectively used in the development of neural foundation models, as they perform comparably to more complex learnable approaches.

Abstract: Recent success in natural language processing has motivated growing interest in large-scale foundation models for neuroimaging data. Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

TL;DR: The paper proves convergence of differential TD learning algorithms for average reward RL without requiring impractical local clock learning rates, making theory more aligned with practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing convergence guarantees for differential TD learning require impractical local clock learning rates tied to state visit counts, which practitioners don't use and don't extend beyond tabular settings.

Method: Proves almost sure convergence of on-policy n-step differential TD using standard diminishing learning rates without local clock. Derives three sufficient conditions for off-policy n-step differential TD convergence without local clock.

Result: Established convergence guarantees for differential TD learning algorithms without impractical local clock requirements, strengthening theoretical foundations and aligning with practical implementations.

Conclusion: The results bridge the gap between theoretical convergence analysis and practical implementations of differential TD learning for average reward RL.

Abstract: The average reward is a fundamental performance metric in reinforcement learning (RL) focusing on the long-run performance of an agent. Differential temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms are a major advance for average reward RL as they provide an efficient online method to learn the value functions associated with the average reward in both on-policy and off-policy settings. However, existing convergence guarantees require a local clock in learning rates tied to state visit counts, which practitioners do not use and does not extend beyond tabular settings. We address this limitation by proving the almost sure convergence of on-policy $n$-step differential TD for any $n$ using standard diminishing learning rates without a local clock. We then derive three sufficient conditions under which off-policy $n$-step differential TD also converges without a local clock. These results strengthen the theoretical foundations of differential TD and bring its convergence analysis closer to practical implementations.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes loss functions for deep learning models that predict molecular fingerprints from LC-MS/MS spectra, revealing a fundamental trade-off between fingerprint prediction accuracy and molecular retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of understanding about how different loss functions affect the performance of deep learning models for compound identification from mass spectrometry data, despite their widespread use in predicting molecular fingerprints for database searching.

Method: The study investigates commonly used loss functions through theoretical analysis, deriving novel regret bounds that characterize when Bayes-optimal decisions for different objectives must diverge.

Result: The analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between fingerprint similarity and molecular retrieval objectives - optimizing for more accurate fingerprint predictions worsens retrieval results, and vice versa. This trade-off depends on the similarity structure of candidate sets.

Conclusion: The theoretical analysis provides guidance for loss function and fingerprint selection in LC-MS/MS compound identification models, showing that practitioners must choose between optimizing for fingerprint accuracy or retrieval performance based on their specific needs.

Abstract: One of the central challenges in the computational analysis of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data is to identify the compounds underlying the output spectra. In recent years, this problem is increasingly tackled using deep learning methods. A common strategy involves predicting a molecular fingerprint vector from an input mass spectrum, which is then used to search for matches in a chemical compound database. While various loss functions are employed in training these predictive models, their impact on model performance remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate commonly used loss functions, deriving novel regret bounds that characterize when Bayes-optimal decisions for these objectives must diverge. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the two objectives of (1) fingerprint similarity and (2) molecular retrieval. Optimizing for more accurate fingerprint predictions typically worsens retrieval results, and vice versa. Our theoretical analysis shows this trade-off depends on the similarity structure of candidate sets, providing guidance for loss function and fingerprint selection.

TL;DR: Extends quantum circuit synthesis with RL to include continuous rotation parameters, comparing one-stage vs two-stage PPO approaches for state preparation tasks up to 10 qubits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend directed quantum circuit synthesis from discrete gate selection to parameterized quantum state preparation with continuous single-qubit rotations, addressing the challenge of optimizing both discrete gate choices and continuous rotation angles simultaneously.

Method: Two training regimes: 1) one-stage agent jointly selects gate type, affected qubit(s), and rotation angle; 2) two-stage variant first proposes discrete circuit then optimizes rotation angles with Adam using parameter-shift gradients. Evaluated PPO and A2C on 2-10 qubit systems with varying complexity.

Result: PPO succeeds with stable hyperparameters (one-stage: learning rate ~5×10⁻⁴, two-stage: ~10⁻⁴), while A2C fails. Both approaches reconstruct computational basis states (83-99% success) and Bell states (61-77% success). Scalability saturates at λ≈3-4 and doesn't extend to 10-qubit targets even at λ=2. Two-stage offers marginal accuracy gains with 3× runtime.

Conclusion: For practical fixed compute budgets, recommend one-stage PPO policy over two-stage approach due to similar performance with significantly less runtime. Provide synthesized circuits and contrast with classical variational baseline to outline scalability improvements.

Abstract: We extend directed quantum circuit synthesis (DQCS) with reinforcement learning from purely discrete gate selection to parameterized quantum state preparation with continuous single-qubit rotations \(R_x\), \(R_y\), and \(R_z\). We compare two training regimes: a one-stage agent that jointly selects the gate type, the affected qubit(s), and the rotation angle; and a two-stage variant that first proposes a discrete circuit and subsequently optimizes the rotation angles with Adam using parameter-shift gradients. Using Gymnasium and PennyLane, we evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor--Critic (A2C) on systems comprising two to ten qubits and on targets of increasing complexity with \(λ\) ranging from one to five. Whereas A2C does not learn effective policies in this setting, PPO succeeds under stable hyperparameters (one-stage: learning rate approximately \(5\times10^{-4}\) with a self-fidelity-error threshold of 0.01; two-stage: learning rate approximately \(10^{-4}\)). Both approaches reliably reconstruct computational basis states (between 83\% and 99\% success) and Bell states (between 61\% and 77\% success). However, scalability saturates for \(λ\) of approximately three to four and does not extend to ten-qubit targets even at \(λ=2\). The two-stage method offers only marginal accuracy gains while requiring around three times the runtime. For practicality under a fixed compute budget, we therefore recommend the one-stage PPO policy, provide explicit synthesized circuits, and contrast with a classical variational baseline to outline avenues for improved scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To maintain electricity grid capacity limits and prevent congestion in residential smart grids by financially incentivizing end users to reduce or shift energy consumption.

Method: Hierarchical architecture with service provider adjusting hourly incentive rates based on wholesale prices and aggregated load. Uses deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal real-time incentive rates under capacity constraints. Models heterogeneous user preferences through appliance-level home energy management systems with dissatisfaction costs.

Result: Simulation with real-world data from three households shows effective peak demand reduction and smoothed aggregated load profile. Achieves approximately 22.82% reduction in peak-to-average ratio compared to no-demand-response case.

Conclusion: The proposed capacity-constrained incentive-based demand response approach successfully manages residential electricity consumption, balancing grid capacity constraints with financial interests of both service providers and end users.

Abstract: This paper presents a capacity-constrained incentive-based demand response approach for residential smart grids. It aims to maintain electricity grid capacity limits and prevent congestion by financially incentivising end users to reduce or shift their energy consumption. The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical architecture in which a service provider adjusts hourly incentive rates based on wholesale electricity prices and aggregated residential load. The financial interests of both the service provider and end users are explicitly considered. A deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to learn optimal real-time incentive rates under explicit capacity constraints. Heterogeneous user preferences are modelled through appliance-level home energy management systems and dissatisfaction costs. Using real-world residential electricity consumption and price data from three households, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces peak demand and smooths the aggregated load profile. This leads to an approximately 22.82% reduction in the peak-to-average ratio compared to the no-demand-response case.

*Sidharth S. Menon,Ameya D. Jagtap*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FEKAN is a feature-enriched version of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks that improves computational efficiency and accuracy without increasing parameters, outperforming existing KAN variants across function approximation, PDE solving, and neural operator tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KAN architectures suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence, limiting their scalability and practical applicability despite offering enhanced interpretability through functional decomposition.

Method: Introduces Feature-Enriched Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FEKAN) that preserves KAN advantages while improving efficiency through feature enrichment without increasing trainable parameters, accelerating convergence and increasing representation capacity.

Result: FEKAN demonstrates substantially faster convergence and consistently higher approximation accuracy than baseline KAN architectures (FastKAN, WavKAN, ReLUKAN, HRKAN, ChebyshevKAN, RBFKAN, SplineKAN) across function approximation, PDE solving, and neural operator tasks.

Conclusion: FEKAN successfully addresses the computational limitations of existing KAN architectures while maintaining interpretability, offering a practical and efficient alternative with proven theoretical foundations and superior performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to multilayer perceptrons, offering enhanced interpretability via functional decomposition. However, existing KAN architectures, including spline-, wavelet-, radial-basis variants, etc., suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence, limiting scalability and practical applicability. Here, we introduce Feature-Enriched Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FEKAN), a simple yet effective extension that preserves all the advantages of KAN while improving computational efficiency and predictive accuracy through feature enrichment, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. By incorporating these additional features, FEKAN accelerates convergence, increases representation capacity, and substantially mitigates the computational overhead characteristic of state-of-the-art KAN architectures. We investigate FEKAN across a comprehensive set of benchmarks, including function-approximation tasks, physics-informed formulations for diverse partial differential equations (PDEs), and neural operator settings that map between input and output function spaces. For function approximation, we systematically compare FEKAN against a broad family of KAN variants, FastKAN, WavKAN, ReLUKAN, HRKAN, ChebyshevKAN, RBFKAN, and the original SplineKAN. Across all tasks, FEKAN demonstrates substantially faster convergence and consistently higher approximation accuracy than the underlying baseline architectures. We also establish the theoretical foundations for FEKAN, showing its superior representation capacity compared to KAN, which contributes to improved accuracy and efficiency.

*Daniel Boharon,Yehuda Dar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes transfer learning for linear regression using multiple overparameterized pretrained models, showing when using more models improves performance and proposing a debiasing method to mitigate overparameterization bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and how using multiple pretrained models improves transfer learning performance, especially when these models are overparameterized, and to address the challenge of overparameterization bias that can compromise learning.

Method: Formulate target learning as optimization minimizing squared errors on target data with penalty on distance from pretrained models. Analytically derive test error and propose a simple debiasing method using multiplicative correction factor to reduce overparameterization bias.

Result: Shows that using sufficiently many overparameterized pretrained models is important for beneficial transfer learning, but learning can be compromised by overparameterization bias. The proposed debiasing method effectively reduces this bias and allows leveraging more pretrained models.

Conclusion: The study provides theoretical insights into transfer learning with multiple pretrained models, demonstrating the importance of using many models when they are overparameterized, and offers a practical debiasing solution to overcome overparameterization bias for improved target predictor learning.

Abstract: We study transfer learning for a linear regression task using several least-squares pretrained models that can be overparameterized.
  We formulate the target learning task as optimization that minimizes squared errors on the target dataset with penalty on the distance of the learned model from the pretrained models. We analytically formulate the test error of the learned target model and provide the corresponding empirical evaluations.
  Our results elucidate when using more pretrained models can improve transfer learning. Specifically, if the pretrained models are overparameterized, using sufficiently many of them is important for beneficial transfer learning. However, the learning may be compromised by overparameterization bias of pretrained models, i.e., the minimum $\ell_2$-norm solution's restriction to a small subspace spanned by the training examples in the high-dimensional parameter space. We propose a simple debiasing via multiplicative correction factor that can reduce the overparameterization bias and leverage more pretrained models to learn a target predictor.

TL;DR: Proposes a black-box adversarial attack framework for Safe RL policies using expert demonstrations and constraint modeling to reveal vulnerabilities without requiring victim policy gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most Safe RL methods assume benign environments and are vulnerable to real-world adversarial perturbations. Existing attacks require policy gradient access, which is often impractical.

Method: Uses expert demonstrations and black-box environment interaction to learn a constraint model and surrogate policy, enabling gradient-based attacks without victim policy gradients or ground-truth safety constraints.

Result: Theoretical analysis establishes feasibility and perturbation bounds. Experiments on multiple Safe RL benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness under limited privileged access.

Conclusion: Proposes a practical adversarial attack framework that reveals vulnerabilities in Safe RL policies using only expert demonstrations and black-box access, addressing limitations of gradient-dependent attacks.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (Safe RL) aims to ensure policy performance while satisfying safety constraints. However, most existing Safe RL methods assume benign environments, making them vulnerable to adversarial perturbations commonly encountered in real-world settings. In addition, existing gradient-based adversarial attacks typically require access to the policy's gradient information, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarial attack framework to reveal vulnerabilities of Safe RL policies. Using expert demonstrations and black-box environment interaction, our framework learns a constraint model and a surrogate (learner) policy, enabling gradient-based attack optimization without requiring the victim policy's internal gradients or the ground-truth safety constraints. We further provide theoretical analysis establishing feasibility and deriving perturbation bounds. Experiments on multiple Safe RL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under limited privileged access.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RIDER: RNA Inverse Design framework using reinforcement learning to optimize for 3D structural similarity rather than just sequence recovery


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for RNA 3D structure inverse design rely on native sequence recovery as evaluation metric, which is limited because different sequences can fold into similar structures, and high recovery doesn't guarantee correct folding

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Pre-train GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on target 3D structure, 2) Fine-tune with improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics

Result: Achieves 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over SOTA methods, improves structural similarity by over 100% across all metrics, and discovers designs distinct from native sequences

Conclusion: RIDER successfully addresses limitations of sequence recovery metrics by directly optimizing for 3D structural similarity, enabling more effective RNA inverse design for synthetic biology and therapeutics

Abstract: The inverse design of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures is crucial for engineering functional RNAs in synthetic biology and therapeutics. While recent deep learning approaches have advanced this field, they are typically optimized and evaluated using native sequence recovery, which is a limited surrogate for structural fidelity, since different sequences can fold into similar 3D structures and high recovery does not necessarily indicate correct folding. To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods. Then, we fine-tune the model with an improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics. Experimental results show that RIDER improves structural similarity by over 100% across all metrics and discovers designs that are distinct from native sequences.

*Gerhard Stenzel,Tobias Rohe,Michael Kölle,Leo Sünkel,Jonas Stein,Claudia Linnhoff-Popien*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Parameter sharing in VQCs creates deceptive gradients that mislead optimizers, increasing optimization difficulty despite reducing parameter count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While parameter sharing in VQCs reduces parameter dimensionality and may mitigate barren plateaus, its complex trade-offs and impact on optimization landscapes have been largely overlooked, creating a need to understand how it fundamentally alters optimization dynamics.

Method: Systematic experimental analysis of parameter sharing effects, introduction of a novel gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm, and development of a quantitative framework for measuring optimization difficulty in quantum circuits.

Result: Increasing parameter sharing generates more complex solution landscapes with higher gradient magnitudes and deceptiveness ratios, causing traditional optimizers (Adam, SGD) to show degraded convergence that depends heavily on hyperparameter selection.

Conclusion: Parameter sharing improves circuit expressivity but significantly increases landscape deceptiveness, revealing a fundamental mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes shaped by parameter sharing.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for quantum machine learning in the NISQ era. While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global optima with fewer parameters, fundamentally alters the optimization landscape through deceptive gradients -- regions where gradient information exists but systematically misleads optimizers away from global optima. Through systematic experimental analysis, we demonstrate that increasing degrees of parameter sharing generate more complex solution landscapes with heightened gradient magnitudes and measurably higher deceptiveness ratios. Our findings reveal that traditional gradient-based optimizers (Adam, SGD) show progressively degraded convergence as parameter sharing increases, with performance heavily dependent on hyperparameter selection. We introduce a novel gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm and a quantitative framework for measuring optimization difficulty in quantum circuits, establishing that while parameter sharing can improve circuit expressivity by orders of magnitude, this comes at the cost of significantly increased landscape deceptiveness. These insights provide important considerations for quantum circuit design in practical applications, highlighting the fundamental mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes shaped by parameter sharing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Double Oracle/PSRO methods face scalability issues when applied to very large cyber-network environments due to computational complexity and memory constraints.

Method: MetaDOAR uses a learned meta-controller with partition-aware filtering to select a small subset of devices, performs focused beam search with a low-level actor, and employs Q-value caching with LRU cache and k-hop invalidation to reduce redundant computations.

Result: MetaDOAR achieves higher player payoffs than state-of-the-art baselines on large network topologies without significant scaling issues in memory usage or training time.

Conclusion: MetaDOAR provides a practical, theoretically motivated approach for efficient hierarchical policy learning in large-scale networked decision problems.

Abstract: We introduce MetaDOAR, a lightweight meta-controller that augments the Double Oracle / PSRO paradigm with a learned, partition-aware filtering layer and Q-value caching to enable scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning on very large cyber-network environments. MetaDOAR learns a compact state projection from per node structural embeddings to rapidly score and select a small subset of devices (a top-k partition) on which a conventional low-level actor performs focused beam search utilizing a critic agent. Selected candidate actions are evaluated with batched critic forwards and stored in an LRU cache keyed by a quantized state projection and local action identifiers, dramatically reducing redundant critic computation while preserving decision quality via conservative k-hop cache invalidation. Empirically, MetaDOAR attains higher player payoffs than SOTA baselines on large network topologies, without significant scaling issues in terms of memory usage or training time. This contribution provide a practical, theoretically motivated path to efficient hierarchical policy learning for large-scale networked decision problems.

*Ankur Moitra,Andrej Risteski,Dhruv Rohatgi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes computational tractability of sampling from reward-tilted diffusion models, showing linear rewards are always efficiently sampleable, providing efficient algorithm for low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, and proving intractability for negative-definite quadratic tilts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference-time algorithms using pre-trained models as subroutines are emerging but current methods are heuristics with failure modes. There's little understanding of when these heuristics can be efficiently improved, particularly for sampling from reward-tilted diffusion models.

Method: Fine-grained computational analysis of sampling from p*(x) ∝ p(x)exp(r(x)) with quadratic rewards r(x) = x^T A x + b^T x. Uses linear-reward tilts as building blocks and introduces Hubbard-Stratonovich transform to handle low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts.

Result: 1) Linear-reward tilts are always efficiently sampleable. 2) Efficient algorithm for sampling from low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts (rank O(1)). 3) Negative-definite quadratic tilts are intractable even with rank 1 (with exponentially-large entries).

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical foundations for understanding computational tractability of inference-time algorithms, establishing clear boundaries between tractable and intractable cases for reward-tilted diffusion sampling with quadratic rewards.

Abstract: Inference-time algorithms are an emerging paradigm in which pre-trained models are used as subroutines to solve downstream tasks. Such algorithms have been proposed for tasks ranging from inverse problems and guided image generation to reasoning. However, the methods currently deployed in practice are heuristics with a variety of failure modes -- and we have very little understanding of when these heuristics can be efficiently improved.
  In this paper, we consider the task of sampling from a reward-tilted diffusion model -- that is, sampling from $p^{\star}(x) \propto p(x) \exp(r(x))$ -- given a reward function $r$ and pre-trained diffusion oracle for $p$. We provide a fine-grained analysis of the computational tractability of this task for quadratic rewards $r(x) = x^\top A x + b^\top x$. We show that linear-reward tilts are always efficiently sampleable -- a simple result that seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature. We use this as a building block, along with a conceptually new ingredient -- the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform -- to provide an efficient algorithm for sampling from low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, i.e. $r(x) = x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite and of rank $O(1)$. For negative-definite tilts, i.e. $r(x) = - x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite, we prove that the problem is intractable even if $A$ is of rank 1 (albeit with exponentially-large entries).

The approach is evaluated using open shared mobility data from e-scooter and e-bike networks in five metropolitan areas.

Result: The methodology demonstrates effectiveness in capturing complexities of modern urban mobility when compared with state-of-the-art methods and a Generative AI-based model. The approach provides accurate predictions essential for improving shared mobility service efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed gradient boosting models offer novel insights for urban micro-mobility management, helping tackle urbanization challenges and contributing to more sustainable, efficient, and livable cities through improved demand forecasting capabilities.

Abstract: Urban demand forecasting plays a critical role in optimizing routing, dispatching, and congestion management within Intelligent Transportation Systems. By leveraging data fusion and analytics techniques, traffic demand forecasting serves as a key intermediate measure for identifying emerging spatial and temporal demand patterns. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing two gradient boosting model variations, one for classiffication and one for regression, both capable of generating demand forecasts at various temporal horizons, from 5 minutes up to one hour. Our overall approach effectively integrates temporal and contextual features, enabling accurate predictions that are essential for improving the efficiency of shared (micro-) mobility services. To evaluate its effectiveness, we utilize open shared mobility data derived from e-scooter and e-bike networks in five metropolitan areas. These real-world datasets allow us to compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods as well as a Generative AI-based model, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of modern urban mobility. Ultimately, our methodology offers novel insights on urban micro-mobility management, helping to tackle the challenges arising from rapid urbanization and thus, contributing to more sustainable, efficient, and livable cities.

*Thomas Michel,Debabrota Basu,Emilie Kaufmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SeMI* is an optimal membership inference attack that exploits model update sequences to detect target data inserted at specific update steps, providing stronger attacks and tighter privacy audits than static model approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI models undergo multiple updates during their lifecycle, creating opportunities to exploit model dynamics for stronger membership inference attacks and tighter privacy audits. Existing optimal MI attacks are limited to static models with infinite samples, lacking rigorous analysis for sequential model updates.

Method: Developed SeMI* (Sequential Membership Inference) attack that uses sequences of model updates to identify target data inserted at specific update steps. Analyzed optimal power for empirical mean computation with finite samples, considering both private and non-private settings. The approach avoids dilution of MI signals that occurs when only examining final models.

Result: SeMI* retrieves existing asymptotic analysis results while working with finite samples. Access to model sequences prevents dilution of MI signals that happens with final-model-only attacks. Adversaries can tune insertion time and canary selection for tighter privacy audits. Experiments across data distributions and DP-SGD trained/fine-tuned models show practical SeMI* variants outperform baselines.

Conclusion: Exploiting model update sequences enables stronger membership inference attacks and tighter privacy audits than static model approaches. SeMI* provides optimal attack power for sequential model settings, offering practical improvements for privacy assessment in dynamic AI model lifecycles.

Abstract: Modern AI models are not static. They go through multiple updates in their lifecycles. Thus, exploiting the model dynamics to create stronger Membership Inference (MI) attacks and tighter privacy audits are timely questions. Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines.

*Meagan Mann,Christian Muise,Erin Meger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ML models (tree-based and GNNs) can accurately predict cop numbers from graph structural properties, with connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters being most predictive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The cop number problem is computationally difficult, with exact algorithms limited to small graphs. The paper explores whether ML can provide scalable approximations for predicting cop numbers from graph properties.

Method: Used classical machine learning (tree-based models) and graph neural networks to predict cop numbers from graph structural properties, with interpretability analysis to identify influential features.

Result: Tree-based models achieved high accuracy despite class imbalance, while GNNs achieved comparable results without feature engineering. Most predictive features were connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters.

Conclusion: ML approaches can complement existing cop number algorithms by providing scalable approximations where exact computation is infeasible, with interpretability aligning with theoretical results.

Abstract: Cops and Robbers is a pursuit evasion game played on a graph, first introduced independently by Quilliot \cite{quilliot1978jeux} and Nowakowski and Winkler \cite{NOWAKOWSKI1983235} over four decades ago. A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible.

TL;DR: Neural Collapse (NC) emergence depends on optimizer choice, not universal. New NC0 metric shows NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay (AdamW). Momentum accelerates NC with SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NC analyses ignore optimizer role, assuming NC is universal across optimization methods. This work challenges that assumption to understand optimizer-dependent emergence of NC.

Method: Introduce NC0 diagnostic metric whose convergence to zero is necessary for NC. Theoretical analysis of NC0 dynamics for SGD, SignGD with coupled/decoupled weight decay. Extensive empirical experiments (3,900 runs) across datasets, architectures, optimizers.

Result: NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay (AdamW). SGD, SignGD with coupled weight decay (Adam), and SignGD with decoupled weight decay (AdamW) show qualitatively different NC0 dynamics. Momentum accelerates NC with SGD. Experiments confirm theoretical results.

Conclusion: First theoretical explanation for optimizer-dependent NC emergence. Highlights critical role of weight-decay coupling in shaping optimizer implicit biases. Challenges universal NC assumption.

Abstract: Neural Collapse (NC) refers to the emergence of highly symmetric geometric structures in the representations of deep neural networks during the terminal phase of training. Despite its prevalence, the theoretical understanding of NC remains limited. Existing analyses largely ignore the role of the optimizer, thereby suggesting that NC is universal across optimization methods. In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that the choice of optimizer plays a critical role in the emergence of NC. The phenomenon is typically quantified through NC metrics, which, however, are difficult to track and analyze theoretically. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel diagnostic metric, NC0, whose convergence to zero is a necessary condition for NC. Using NC0, we provide theoretical evidence that NC cannot emerge under decoupled weight decay in adaptive optimizers, as implemented in AdamW. Concretely, we prove that SGD, SignGD with coupled weight decay (a special case of Adam), and SignGD with decoupled weight decay (a special case of AdamW) exhibit qualitatively different NC0 dynamics. Also, we show the accelerating effect of momentum on NC (beyond convergence of train loss) when trained with SGD, being the first result concerning momentum in the context of NC. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical experiments consisting of 3,900 training runs across various datasets, architectures, optimizers, and hyperparameters, confirming our theoretical results. This work provides the first theoretical explanation for optimizer-dependent emergence of NC and highlights the overlooked role of weight-decay coupling in shaping the implicit biases of optimizers.

*Shuta Kikuchi,Shu Tanaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FMQA optimization method applied to RNA inverse folding, with analysis of nucleotide-to-integer assignments and binary encoding methods showing domain-wall encoding with GC at boundaries yields more stable structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RNA inverse folding methods require many sequence evaluations, limiting practical use when experimental validation is costly. Need for efficient optimization methods that work with limited evaluations.

Method: Proposed FMQA (factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing) framework for RNA inverse folding. Evaluated all 24 possible nucleotide-to-integer assignments (0-3) combined with four binary encoding methods (one-hot, domain-wall, binary, unary).

Result: One-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings in normalized ensemble defect. Domain-wall encoding with nucleotides assigned to boundary integers (0 and 3) promotes GC enrichment in stem regions, leading to more thermodynamically stable secondary structures than one-hot encoding.

Conclusion: FMQA provides effective RNA inverse folding with limited evaluations. Encoding choice significantly impacts solution quality, with domain-wall encoding and strategic nucleotide assignments to boundary integers producing more stable RNA structures.

Abstract: The RNA inverse folding problem aims to identify nucleotide sequences that preferentially adopt a given target secondary structure. While various heuristic and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, many require a large number of sequence evaluations, which limits their applicability when experimental validation is costly. We propose a method to solve the problem using a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA). FMQA is a discrete black-box optimization method reported to obtain high-quality solutions with a limited number of evaluations. Applying FMQA to the problem requires converting nucleotides into binary variables. However, the influence of integer-to-nucleotide assignments and binary-integer encoding on the performance of FMQA has not been thoroughly investigated, even though such choices determine the structure of the surrogate model and the search landscape, and thus can directly affect solution quality. Therefore, this study aims both to establish a novel FMQA framework for RNA inverse folding and to analyze the effects of these assignments and encoding methods. We evaluated all 24 possible assignments of the four nucleotides to the ordered integers (0-3), in combination with four binary-integer encoding methods. Our results demonstrated that one-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings in terms of the normalized ensemble defect value. In domain-wall encoding, nucleotides assigned to the boundary integers (0 and 3) appeared with higher frequency. In the RNA inverse folding problem, assigning guanine and cytosine to these boundary integers promoted their enrichment in stem regions, which led to more thermodynamically stable secondary structures than those obtained with one-hot encoding.

### [222] [Neighborhood Stability as a Measure of Nearest Neighbor Searchability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16673)
*Thomas Vecchiato,Sebastian Bruch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two measures (clustering-NSM and point-NSM) to predict the suitability of clustering-based approximate nearest neighbor search for high-dimensional datasets without needing to actually perform the search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are no analytical tools to determine whether clustering-based ANNS will work well for a given dataset ("searchability"). Current approaches require actually running the search algorithm to evaluate performance.

Method: Two measures: 1) Clustering-NSM - an internal clustering quality measure that predicts ANNS accuracy, and 2) Point-NSM - a measure of clusterability that predicts clustering-NSM. Both are based on nearest neighbor relationships rather than distances.

Result: The measures allow determining dataset searchability for clustering-based ANNS using only the data points, applicable to various distance functions including inner product.

Conclusion: The paper provides the first analytical tools to predict clustering-based ANNS performance on high-dimensional datasets, enabling better algorithm selection and dataset evaluation.

Abstract: Clustering-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) organizes a set of points into partitions, and searches only a few of them to find the nearest neighbors of a query. Despite its popularity, there are virtually no analytical tools to determine the suitability of clustering-based ANNS for a given dataset -- what we call "searchability." To address that gap, we present two measures for flat clusterings of high-dimensional points in Euclidean space. First is Clustering-Neighborhood Stability Measure (clustering-NSM), an internal measure of clustering quality -- a function of a clustering of a dataset -- that we show to be predictive of ANNS accuracy. The second, Point-Neighborhood Stability Measure (point-NSM), is a measure of clusterability -- a function of the dataset itself -- that is predictive of clustering-NSM. The two together allow us to determine whether a dataset is searchable by clustering-based ANNS given only the data points. Importantly, both are functions of nearest neighbor relationships between points, not distances, making them applicable to various distance functions including inner product.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML approaches for molecular analog generation either lack edit controllability or are limited to small models and restricted settings, failing to capture the practical transformation patterns used by medicinal chemists.

Method: Propose variable-to-variable formulation for analog generation, train foundation model on large-scale MMP transformations (MMPTs), develop prompting mechanisms for user-specified transformation patterns, and introduce MMPT-RAG retrieval-augmented framework using external reference analogs as contextual guidance.

Result: Experiments on general chemical corpora and patent-specific datasets demonstrate improved diversity, novelty, and controllability, with the method recovering realistic analog structures in practical discovery scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed MMPT foundation model with prompting and retrieval-augmented guidance enables practical, controllable analog generation that captures medicinal chemists' transformation patterns and generalizes from project-specific series.

Abstract: Matched molecular pairs (MMPs) capture the local chemical edits that medicinal chemists routinely use to design analogs, but existing ML approaches either operate at the whole-molecule level with limited edit controllability or learn MMP-style edits from restricted settings and small models. We propose a variable-to-variable formulation of analog generation and train a foundation model on large-scale MMP transformations (MMPTs) to generate diverse variables conditioned on an input variable. To enable practical control, we develop prompting mechanisms that let the users specify preferred transformation patterns during generation. We further introduce MMPT-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that uses external reference analogs as contextual guidance to steer generation and generalize from project-specific series. Experiments on general chemical corpora and patent-specific datasets demonstrate improved diversity, novelty, and controllability, and show that our method recovers realistic analog structures in practical discovery scenarios.

### [224] [Protecting the Undeleted in Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16697)
*Aloni Cohen,Refael Kohen,Kobbi Nissim,Uri Stemmer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine unlearning's "perfect retraining" approach creates privacy risks for undeleted data, allowing reconstruction attacks. Existing definitions are either vulnerable or too restrictive. A new security definition is proposed that protects undeleted data while supporting essential functionalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine unlearning approaches aim for perfect retraining (matching the model that would have been trained without the deleted data), but this creates significant privacy risks for the remaining data points. The paper aims to address this security vulnerability.

Method: 1) Demonstrate reconstruction attacks showing perfect retraining allows adversaries to reconstruct almost entire datasets using only ω(1) controlled data points. 2) Survey existing unlearning definitions showing they're either vulnerable to attacks or too restrictive. 3) Propose a new security definition specifically protecting undeleted data from leakage caused by deletions.

Result: Perfect retraining approach enables reconstruction attacks where adversaries can recover almost entire datasets. Existing definitions fail to provide adequate security. The proposed new definition successfully protects undeleted data while supporting essential functionalities like bulletin boards, summations, and statistical learning.

Conclusion: Machine unlearning definitions must specifically protect undeleted data from leakage caused by deletions. The proposed security definition addresses this gap, providing both security for remaining data and support for practical functionalities, offering a better balance between privacy and utility.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific data points from a trained model, often striving to emulate "perfect retraining", i.e., producing the model that would have been obtained had the deleted data never been included. We demonstrate that this approach, and security definitions that enable it, carry significant privacy risks for the remaining (undeleted) data points. We present a reconstruction attack showing that for certain tasks, which can be computed securely without deletions, a mechanism adhering to perfect retraining allows an adversary controlling merely $ω(1)$ data points to reconstruct almost the entire dataset merely by issuing deletion requests. We survey existing definitions for machine unlearning, showing they are either susceptible to such attacks or too restrictive to support basic functionalities like exact summation. To address this problem, we propose a new security definition that specifically safeguards undeleted data against leakage caused by the deletion of other points. We show that our definition permits several essential functionalities, such as bulletin boards, summations, and statistical learning.

### [225] [Causality is Key for Interpretability Claims to Generalise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16698)
*Shruti Joshi,Aaron Mueller,David Klindt,Wieland Brendel,Patrik Reizinger,Dhanya Sridhar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that causal inference provides a rigorous framework for interpretability research, clarifying what evidence supports different types of claims about LLM behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretability research on LLMs suffers from pitfalls: findings that don't generalize and causal interpretations that exceed the available evidence. There's a need for a more rigorous framework to ensure interpretability claims are properly supported by evidence.

Method: The paper proposes using Pearl's causal hierarchy to structure interpretability research. It distinguishes between observational studies (associations), interventions (ablations/activation patching), and counterfactuals. It shows how causal representation learning operationalizes this hierarchy by specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions.

Result: The analysis yields a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations that match claims to evidence, ensuring findings generalize properly.

Conclusion: Causal inference provides a rigorous foundation for interpretability research, clarifying what constitutes valid evidence for different types of claims about LLM behavior, from associations to interventions to counterfactuals.

Abstract: Interpretability research on large language models (LLMs) has yielded important insights into model behaviour, yet recurring pitfalls persist: findings that do not generalise, and causal interpretations that outrun the evidence. Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed to achieve it, and the inferences it can support. Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts. However, counterfactual claims -- i.e., asking what the model output would have been for the same prompt under an unobserved intervention -- remain largely unverifiable without controlled supervision. We show how causal representation learning (CRL) operationalises this hierarchy, specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions. Together, these motivate a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations matching claims to evidence such that findings generalise.

### [226] [Knowledge-Embedded Latent Projection for Robust Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16709)
*Weijing Tang,Ming Yuan,Zongqi Xia,Tianxi Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A knowledge-embedded latent projection model that uses semantic embeddings to regularize representation learning for high-dimensional discrete data matrices in imbalanced regimes, with applications to EHR analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of estimating latent space models in imbalanced regimes where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other, particularly in EHR applications where cohort sizes are limited but feature spaces are extremely large due to medical coding systems. Leverage increasing availability of external semantic embeddings like pre-trained clinical concept embeddings.

Method: Propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that models column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Develop a two-step estimation procedure combining semantically guided subspace construction via kernel PCA with scalable projected gradient descent.

Result: Establish estimation error bounds characterizing the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by kernel projection. Provide local convergence guarantees for the non-convex optimization procedure. Demonstrate effectiveness through extensive simulations and real-world EHR application.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning in imbalanced high-dimensional data settings, providing both theoretical guarantees and practical utility for EHR analysis.

Abstract: Latent space models are widely used for analyzing high-dimensional discrete data matrices, such as patient-feature matrices in electronic health records (EHRs), by capturing complex dependence structures through low-dimensional embeddings. However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
