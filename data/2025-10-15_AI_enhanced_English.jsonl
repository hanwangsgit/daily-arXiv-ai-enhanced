We\nfirst introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a\nConstrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic\nrelationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.\nBuilding upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing\npractices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,\nIterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and\nContext-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in\nthis domain.
