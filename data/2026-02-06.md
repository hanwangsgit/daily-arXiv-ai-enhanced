### [1] [SIDeR: Semantic Identity Decoupling for Unrestricted Face Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04994)
*Zhuosen Bao,Xia Du,Zheng Lin,Jizhe Zhou,Zihan Fang,Jiening Wu,Yuxin Zhang,Zhe Chen,Chi-man Pun,Wei Ni,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIDeR is a semantic decoupling framework that protects face privacy by separating identity features from visual appearance, generating anonymous adversarial faces while maintaining machine-level identity consistency, with password-based restoration capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep integration of facial recognition in online services creates privacy risks; current methods need better decoupling of identity from visual representations during storage/transmission to protect privacy while maintaining utility.

Method: Decomposes facial images into identity feature vectors and semantic appearance components, uses semantic-guided recomposition in diffusion model latent space, incorporates momentum-driven unrestricted perturbation optimization and semantic-visual balancing to generate diverse adversarial samples with password-based restoration.

Result: Achieves 99% attack success rate in black-box scenarios, outperforms baselines by 41.28% in PSNR-based restoration quality on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets.

Conclusion: SIDeR effectively protects face privacy through semantic decoupling, generating visually anonymous yet machine-consistent adversarial faces with high restoration quality for authorized access.

Abstract: With the deep integration of facial recognition into online banking, identity verification, and other networked services, achieving effective decoupling of identity information from visual representations during image storage and transmission has become a critical challenge for privacy protection. To address this issue, we propose SIDeR, a Semantic decoupling-driven framework for unrestricted face privacy protection. SIDeR decomposes a facial image into a machine-recognizable identity feature vector and a visually perceptible semantic appearance component. By leveraging semantic-guided recomposition in the latent space of a diffusion model, it generates visually anonymous adversarial faces while maintaining machine-level identity consistency. The framework incorporates momentum-driven unrestricted perturbation optimization and a semantic-visual balancing factor to synthesize multiple visually diverse, highly natural adversarial samples. Furthermore, for authorized access, the protected image can be restored to its original form when the correct password is provided. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that SIDeR achieves a 99% attack success rate in black-box scenarios and outperforms baseline methods by 41.28% in PSNR-based restoration quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniTrack is a plug-and-play graph-theoretic loss function that enhances multi-object tracking performance by optimizing tracking-specific objectives through unified differentiable learning, working with existing MOT systems without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior graph-based MOT methods require redesigning tracking architectures. There's a need for a universal training objective that can integrate detection accuracy, identity preservation, and spatiotemporal consistency into a single end-to-end trainable loss function that works with existing systems.

Method: UniTrack uses differentiable graph representation learning to create a universal training objective that enables networks to learn holistic representations of motion continuity and identity relationships across frames. It's designed as a plug-and-play loss function that integrates with existing MOT systems without architectural modifications.

Result: UniTrack shows consistent improvements across diverse tracking models (Trackformer, MOTR, FairMOT, ByteTrack, GTR, MOTE) and multiple challenging benchmarks. Achieves up to 53% reduction in identity switches and 12% IDF1 improvements, with GTR achieving 9.7% MOTA improvement on SportsMOT.

Conclusion: UniTrack provides an effective plug-and-play solution for enhancing multi-object tracking performance through unified differentiable learning, demonstrating significant improvements across various architectures and datasets without requiring system redesign.

Abstract: We present UniTrack, a plug-and-play graph-theoretic loss function designed to significantly enhance multi-object tracking (MOT) performance by directly optimizing tracking-specific objectives through unified differentiable learning. Unlike prior graph-based MOT methods that redesign tracking architectures, UniTrack provides a universal training objective that integrates detection accuracy, identity preservation, and spatiotemporal consistency into a single end-to-end trainable loss function, enabling seamless integration with existing MOT systems without architectural modifications. Through differentiable graph representation learning, UniTrack enables networks to learn holistic representations of motion continuity and identity relationships across frames. We validate UniTrack across diverse tracking models and multiple challenging benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements across all tested architectures and datasets including Trackformer, MOTR, FairMOT, ByteTrack, GTR, and MOTE. Extensive evaluations show up to 53\% reduction in identity switches and 12\% IDF1 improvements across challenging benchmarks, with GTR achieving peak performance gains of 9.7\% MOTA on SportsMOT.

### [3] [VISTA: Enhancing Visual Conditioning via Track-Following Preference Optimization in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05049)
*Yiye Chen,Yanan Jian,Xiaoyi Dong,Shuxin Cao,Jing Wu,Patricio Vela,Benjamin E. Lundell,Dongdong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training framework to strengthen visual conditioning in Vision-Language-Action models to address vision-action misalignment, improving both visual dependence and task performance without architectural changes or additional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models often suffer from vision-action misalignment where action predictions show weak dependence on current visual states, leading to unreliable outputs. The authors observed that successful rollouts consistently exhibit stronger visual dependence than failed ones.

Method: A two-stage training framework: 1) Align action prediction with visual input via preference optimization on a track-following surrogate task, 2) Transfer enhanced alignment to instruction-following tasks through latent-space distillation during supervised finetuning.

Result: The method improves both visual conditioning and task performance for discrete OpenVLA, and yields consistent gains when extended to the continuous OpenVLA-OFT setting, without architectural modifications or additional data collection.

Conclusion: Explicitly strengthening visual conditioning in VLA models through the proposed training framework effectively addresses vision-action misalignment and improves model reliability and performance across different settings.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks. Despite the success, extending large pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to the action space can induce vision-action misalignment, where action predictions exhibit weak dependence on the current visual state, leading to unreliable action outputs. In this work, we study VLA models through the lens of visual conditioning and empirically show that successful rollouts consistently exhibit stronger visual dependence than failed ones. Motivated by this observation, we propose a training framework that explicitly strengthens visual conditioning in VLA models. Our approach first aligns action prediction with visual input via preference optimization on a track-following surrogate task, and then transfers the enhanced alignment to instruction-following task through latent-space distillation during supervised finetuning. Without introducing architectural modifications or additional data collection, our method improves both visual conditioning and task performance for discrete OpenVLA, and further yields consistent gains when extended to the continuous OpenVLA-OFT setting.

### [4] [Food Portion Estimation: From Pixels to Calories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05078)
*Gautham Vinod,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Review paper exploring different strategies for accurate food portion estimation from images, focusing on overcoming the 2D-to-3D size estimation challenge in dietary assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-based dietary assessment is crucial for health monitoring and chronic disease prevention, but suffers from the fundamental limitation of estimating 3D food sizes from 2D images.

Method: Review and analysis of various strategies including: auxiliary inputs (depth maps, multi-view images), model-based approaches (template matching), and deep learning methods (monocular images, combined image+auxiliary inputs).

Result: The paper systematically explores and compares different technical approaches for bridging the 2D-to-3D gap in food portion estimation, though specific quantitative results aren't provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: Multiple strategies exist to address the critical limitation of 3D size estimation from 2D food images, with deep learning and auxiliary input methods showing promise for accurate portion estimation in dietary assessment systems.

Abstract: Reliance on images for dietary assessment is an important strategy to accurately and conveniently monitor an individual's health, making it a vital mechanism in the prevention and care of chronic diseases and obesity. However, image-based dietary assessment suffers from estimating the three dimensional size of food from 2D image inputs. Many strategies have been devised to overcome this critical limitation such as the use of auxiliary inputs like depth maps, multi-view inputs, or model-based approaches such as template matching. Deep learning also helps bridge the gap by either using monocular images or combinations of the image and the auxillary inputs to precisely predict the output portion from the image input. In this paper, we explore the different strategies employed for accurate portion estimation.

*Joseph D. Janizek,Sonnet Xu,Junayd Lateef,Roxana Daneshjou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCR method identifies visual concepts in LMMs to audit medical AI performance gaps across demographic subgroups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need reliable ML auditing methods for safety-critical healthcare applications to uncover model shortcomings and performance disparities.

Method: Visual Concept Ranking (VCR) method identifies important visual concepts in LMMs, generates hypotheses about visual feature dependencies, and validates with manual interventions.

Result: LMMs show unexpected performance gaps across demographic subgroups in medical tasks; VCR successfully identifies visual concepts that explain these disparities.

Conclusion: VCR provides an effective auditing tool for understanding and addressing performance disparities in medical AI models through visual concept analysis.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical domains such as healthcare requires auditing methods that can uncover model shortcomings. We introduce a method for identifying important visual concepts within large multimodal models (LMMs) and use it to investigate the behaviors these models exhibit when prompted with medical tasks. We primarily focus on the task of classifying malignant skin lesions from clinical dermatology images, with supplemental experiments including both chest radiographs and natural images. After showing how LMMs display unexpected gaps in performance between different demographic subgroups when prompted with demonstrating examples, we apply our method, Visual Concept Ranking (VCR), to these models and prompts. VCR generates hypotheses related to different visual feature dependencies, which we are then able to validate with manual interventions.

### [6] [CLEAR-HPV: Interpretable Concept Discovery for HPV-Associated Morphology in Whole-Slide Histology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05126)
*Weiyi Qin,Yingci Liu-Swetz,Shiwei Tan,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLEAR-HPV is an interpretable MIL framework that discovers morphological concepts in HPV-related cancer histopathology without requiring concept labels, reducing high-dimensional embeddings to compact, interpretable concept-fraction vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) models for HPV-related cancer histopathology provide strong slide-level predictions but offer limited morphological interpretability, making it difficult to understand what visual features drive predictions.

Method: CLEAR-HPV restructures the MIL latent space using attention mechanisms to automatically discover morphological concepts (keratinizing, basaloid, stromal) without concept labels during training. It operates in an attention-weighted latent space, generates spatial concept maps, and represents each slide using compact concept-fraction vectors.

Result: The framework reduces high-dimensional feature spaces (e.g., 1536 dimensions) to only 10 interpretable concepts while preserving predictive information. It generalizes consistently across TCGA-HNSCC, TCGA-CESC, and CPTAC-HNSCC datasets.

Conclusion: CLEAR-HPV provides compact, concept-level interpretability through a general, backbone-agnostic framework for attention-based MIL models of whole-slide histopathology, enabling better understanding of morphological features driving HPV-related cancer predictions.

Abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV) status is a critical determinant of prognosis and treatment response in head and neck and cervical cancers. Although attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) achieves strong slide-level prediction for HPV-related whole-slide histopathology, it provides limited morphologic interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Concept-Level Explainable Attention-guided Representation for HPV (CLEAR-HPV), a framework that restructures the MIL latent space using attention to enable concept discovery without requiring concept labels during training. Operating in an attention-weighted latent space, CLEAR-HPV automatically discovers keratinizing, basaloid, and stromal morphologic concepts, generates spatial concept maps, and represents each slide using a compact concept-fraction vector. CLEAR-HPV's concept-fraction vectors preserve the predictive information of the original MIL embeddings while reducing the high-dimensional feature space (e.g., 1536 dimensions) to only 10 interpretable concepts. CLEAR-HPV generalizes consistently across TCGA-HNSCC, TCGA-CESC, and CPTAC-HNSCC, providing compact, concept-level interpretability through a general, backbone-agnostic framework for attention-based MIL models of whole-slide histopathology.

### [7] [ARGaze: Autoregressive Transformers for Online Egocentric Gaze Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05132)
*Jia Li,Wenjie Zhao,Shijian Deng,Bolin Lai,Yuheng Wu,RUijia Chen,Jon E. Froehlich,Yuhang Zhao,Yapeng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARGaze: An autoregressive transformer model for online egocentric gaze estimation that predicts current gaze by conditioning on current visual features and a fixed-length window of recent gaze history, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online egocentric gaze estimation lacks explicit head or eye signals, requiring inference from sparse cues. Gaze exhibits strong temporal continuity during goal-directed activities, where recent gaze history provides a powerful prior for predicting future gaze.

Method: ARGaze reformulates gaze estimation as sequential prediction using a transformer decoder. At each timestep, it predicts current gaze by conditioning on current visual features and a fixed-length Gaze Context Window of recent gaze target estimates, enabling causal, bounded-resource streaming inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple egocentric benchmarks under online evaluation. Extensive ablations validate that autoregressive modeling with bounded gaze history is critical for robust prediction.

Conclusion: Autoregressive modeling with gaze history context enables effective online egocentric gaze estimation. The approach will be released as open-source code and pre-trained models.

Abstract: Online egocentric gaze estimation predicts where a camera wearer is looking from first-person video using only past and current frames, a task essential for augmented reality and assistive technologies. Unlike third-person gaze estimation, this setting lacks explicit head or eye signals, requiring models to infer current visual attention from sparse, indirect cues such as hand-object interactions and salient scene content. We observe that gaze exhibits strong temporal continuity during goal-directed activities: knowing where a person looked recently provides a powerful prior for predicting where they look next. Inspired by vision-conditioned autoregressive decoding in vision-language models, we propose ARGaze, which reformulates gaze estimation as sequential prediction: at each timestep, a transformer decoder predicts current gaze by conditioning on (i) current visual features and (ii) a fixed-length Gaze Context Window of recent gaze target estimates. This design enforces causality and enables bounded-resource streaming inference. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple egocentric benchmarks under online evaluation, with extensive ablations validating that autoregressive modeling with bounded gaze history is critical for robust prediction. We will release our source code and pre-trained models.

### [8] [AirGlove: Exploring Egocentric 3D Hand Tracking and Appearance Generalization for Sensing Gloves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05159)
*Wenhui Cui,Ziyi Kou,Chuan Qin,Ergys Ristani,Li Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-based hand tracking models perform poorly on gloved hands due to appearance differences. AirGlove uses existing gloves to generalize to new glove designs with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensing gloves are important for teleoperation and robotic learning, but sensor-based tracking has accuracy issues. Vision-based approaches work well on bare hands but their performance on gloved hands with different visual appearances is unexplored.

Method: AirGlove leverages existing gloves to generalize learned glove representations to new glove designs with limited data. The approach is evaluated under both zero-shot and fine-tuning setups.

Result: Existing bare-hand models suffer substantial performance degradation on sensing gloves due to appearance gap. AirGlove effectively generalizes hand pose models to new glove designs and achieves significant performance boost over compared schemes.

Conclusion: AirGlove addresses the appearance gap problem in vision-based hand tracking for gloved hands, enabling better generalization to new glove designs with limited data.

Abstract: Sensing gloves have become important tools for teleoperation and robotic policy learning as they are able to provide rich signals like speed, acceleration and tactile feedback. A common approach to track gloved hands is to directly use the sensor signals (e.g., angular velocity, gravity orientation) to estimate 3D hand poses. However, sensor-based tracking can be restrictive in practice as the accuracy is often impacted by sensor signal and calibration quality. Recent advances in vision-based approaches have achieved strong performance on human hands via large-scale pre-training, but their performance on gloved hands with distinct visual appearances remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of vision-based hand tracking models on gloved hands under both zero-shot and fine-tuning setups. Our analysis shows that existing bare-hand models suffer from substantial performance degradation on sensing gloves due to large appearance gap between bare-hand and glove designs. We therefore propose AirGlove, which leverages existing gloves to generalize the learned glove representations towards new gloves with limited data. Experiments with multiple sensing gloves show that AirGlove effectively generalizes the hand pose models to new glove designs and achieves a significant performance boost over the compared schemes.

*Anay Majee,Rishabh Iyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHaSaM is a novel combinatorial approach using submodular optimization for fairness-aware representation learning that mines hard samples to address data imbalance and uses submodular conditional mutual information to minimize sensitive attribute influence while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks inherit social and demographic biases from annotated training data, leading to unfair predictions based on sensitive attributes like race, age, and gender. Existing methods struggle with inherent data imbalance between attribute groups and inadvertently emphasize sensitive attributes, worsening both fairness and performance.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) SHaSaM-MINE uses submodular subset selection to mine hard positives and negatives, effectively mitigating data imbalance. 2) SHaSaM-LEARN introduces combinatorial loss functions based on Submodular Conditional Mutual Information to maximize decision boundaries between target classes while minimizing influence of sensitive attributes.

Result: Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace show state-of-the-art results: up to 2.7 points improvement in model fairness (Equalized Odds) and 3.5% gain in Accuracy, achieved within fewer epochs compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SHaSaM provides a unified formulation that restricts models from learning features tied to sensitive attributes, significantly enhancing fairness without sacrificing performance, offering an effective solution to bias mitigation in deep learning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often inherit social and demographic biases from annotated data during model training, leading to unfair predictions, especially in the presence of sensitive attributes like race, age, gender etc. Existing methods fall prey to the inherent data imbalance between attribute groups and inadvertently emphasize on sensitive attributes, worsening unfairness and performance. To surmount these challenges, we propose SHaSaM (Submodular Hard Sample Mining), a novel combinatorial approach that models fairness-driven representation learning as a submodular hard-sample mining problem. Our two-stage approach comprises of SHaSaM-MINE, which introduces a submodular subset selection strategy to mine hard positives and negatives - effectively mitigating data imbalance, and SHaSaM-LEARN, which introduces a family of combinatorial loss functions based on Submodular Conditional Mutual Information to maximize the decision boundary between target classes while minimizing the influence of sensitive attributes. This unified formulation restricts the model from learning features tied to sensitive attributes, significantly enhancing fairness without sacrificing performance. Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace demonstrate that SHaSaM achieves state-of-the-art results, with up to 2.7 points improvement in model fairness (Equalized Odds) and a 3.5% gain in Accuracy, within fewer epochs as compared to existing methods.

Motivation: Underwater photography suffers from reduced contrast, spatial blur, and color distortions that obscure marine life vibrancy, requiring heavy post-processing to correct.

Method: Developed image-to-image pipeline using synthetic corruption pipeline and diffusion-based generation to reverse underwater degradations, trained on high-quality awareness photography dataset.

Abstract: Underwater photography presents significant inherent challenges including reduced contrast, spatial blur, and wavelength-dependent color distortions. These effects can obscure the vibrancy of marine life and awareness photographers in particular are often challenged with heavy post-processing pipelines to correct for these distortions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defense methods like diffusion-based purification suffer from high computational costs and information loss. There's a need for more efficient and effective adversarial defense strategies.

Method: ShapePuri integrates two components: 1) Shape Encoding Module (SEM) that provides dense geometric guidance using Signed Distance Functions (SDF) to align model representations with stable structural invariants, and 2) Global Appearance Debiasing (GAD) module that mitigates appearance bias through stochastic transformations.

Result: Achieves 84.06% clean accuracy and 81.64% robust accuracy under AutoAttack protocol, becoming the first defense framework to surpass the 80% threshold on this benchmark. The approach is scalable, efficient, and preserves prediction stability without requiring auxiliary modules or additional computational cost.

Conclusion: ShapePuri provides an effective adversarial defense solution that leverages shape guidance and appearance debiasing to achieve state-of-the-art robustness while maintaining efficiency and scalability, addressing key limitations of existing defense methods.

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate impressive performance in visual recognition, but they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that is imperceptible to the human. Although existing defense strategies such as adversarial training and purification have achieved progress, diffusion-based purification often involves high computational costs and information loss. To address these challenges, we introduce Shape Guided Purification (ShapePuri), a novel defense framework enhances robustness by aligning model representations with stable structural invariants. ShapePuri integrates two components: a Shape Encoding Module (SEM) that provides dense geometric guidance through Signed Distance Functions (SDF), and a Global Appearance Debiasing (GAD) module that mitigates appearance bias via stochastic transformations. In our experiments, ShapePuri achieves $84.06\%$ clean accuracy and $81.64\%$ robust accuracy under the AutoAttack protocol, representing the first defense framework to surpass the $80\%$ threshold on this benchmark. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient adversarial defense that preserves prediction stability during inference without requiring auxiliary modules or additional computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseGaussian: A pose-guided Gaussian Splatting framework for high-fidelity human novel view synthesis that uses human pose as both structural prior and temporal cue, achieving real-time rendering at 100 FPS with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in dynamic human scene reconstruction, particularly articulated motion and severe self-occlusion, by better leveraging human pose information beyond simple conditioning or warping approaches used in prior works.

Method: A pose-guided Gaussian Splatting framework where human pose serves dual purposes: as structural prior fused with color encoder for depth refinement, and as temporal cue processed by dedicated pose encoder for temporal consistency. Integrated into fully differentiable, end-to-end trainable pipeline.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ZJU-MoCap, THuman2.0, and in-house datasets with PSNR 30.86, SSIM 0.979, LPIPS 0.028. Maintains real-time rendering at 100 FPS while preserving Gaussian Splatting efficiency.

Conclusion: PoseGaussian effectively embeds pose signals into both geometric and temporal stages, improving robustness and generalization for dynamic human novel view synthesis while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities.

Abstract: We propose PoseGaussian, a pose-guided Gaussian Splatting framework for high-fidelity human novel view synthesis. Human body pose serves a dual purpose in our design: as a structural prior, it is fused with a color encoder to refine depth estimation; as a temporal cue, it is processed by a dedicated pose encoder to enhance temporal consistency across frames. These components are integrated into a fully differentiable, end-to-end trainable pipeline. Unlike prior works that use pose only as a condition or for warping, PoseGaussian embeds pose signals into both geometric and temporal stages to improve robustness and generalization. It is specifically designed to address challenges inherent in dynamic human scenes, such as articulated motion and severe self-occlusion. Notably, our framework achieves real-time rendering at 100 FPS, maintaining the efficiency of standard Gaussian Splatting pipelines. We validate our approach on ZJU-MoCap, THuman2.0, and in-house datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality and structural accuracy (PSNR 30.86, SSIM 0.979, LPIPS 0.028).

*Shivanshu Shekhar,Uttaran Bhattacharya,Raghavendra Addanki,Mehrab Tanjim,Somdeb Sarkhel,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video generative models can be repurposed as temporally-aware reward models by treating them as energy-based models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with far fewer human annotations than VLM-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for aligning video generative models with human preferences rely on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for reward modeling, but these models struggle to capture subtle temporal dynamics in videos.

Method: Transform state-of-the-art video generation models into reward models by reformulating them as energy-based models (EBMs) that assign low energy to high-quality videos and high energy to degraded ones. Train via contrastive objectives using challenging synthetic negative videos created through latent-space perturbations: temporal slicing, feature swapping, and frame shuffling.

Result: The proposed model (Generative-Transformer-based Self-Supervised Video Judge) achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench using only 30K human annotations, which is 6× to 65× fewer than existing VLM-based approaches.

Conclusion: Video generative models can be effectively repurposed as temporally-aware reward models through energy-based modeling and synthetic negative sampling, providing a more efficient and accurate approach to video quality assessment than VLM-based methods.

Abstract: Aligning video generative models with human preferences remains challenging: current approaches rely on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for reward modeling, but these models struggle to capture subtle temporal dynamics. We propose a fundamentally different approach: repurposing video generative models, which are inherently designed to model temporal structure, as reward models. We present the Generative-Transformer-based Self-Supervised Video Judge (\modelname), a novel evaluation model that transforms state-of-the-art video generation models into powerful temporally-aware reward models. Our key insight is that generative models can be reformulated as energy-based models (EBMs) that assign low energy to high-quality videos and high energy to degraded ones, enabling them to discriminate video quality with remarkable precision when trained via contrastive objectives. To prevent the model from exploiting superficial differences between real and generated videos, we design challenging synthetic negative videos through controlled latent-space perturbations: temporal slicing, feature swapping, and frame shuffling, which simulate realistic but subtle visual degradations. This forces the model to learn meaningful spatiotemporal features rather than trivial artifacts. \modelname achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench using only 30K human-annotations: $6\times$ to $65\times$ fewer than existing VLM-based approaches.

*Chuqin Zhou,Xiaoyue Ling,Yunuo Chen,Jincheng Dai,Guo Lu,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework combining explicit and implicit representations for ultra-low bitrate image compression, achieving state-of-the-art rate-perception performance without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural codecs degrade at ultra-low bitrates, and current generative compression methods face a tradeoff between semantic faithfulness (explicit methods) and perceptual realism (implicit methods).

Method: Proposes a training-free framework that integrates explicit high-level semantics (conditioning diffusion models) with implicit fine-grained details (reverse-channel coding), plus a plug-in encoder for distortion-perception tradeoff control.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art rate-perception performance, outperforming existing methods by 29.92%, 19.33%, and 20.89% in DISTS BD-Rate on Kodak, DIV2K, and CLIC2020 datasets respectively.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully bridges the gap between explicit and implicit representations, enabling high-quality ultra-low bitrate compression without the semantic faithfulness vs. perceptual realism tradeoff.

Abstract: While recent neural codecs achieve strong performance at low bitrates when optimized for perceptual quality, their effectiveness deteriorates significantly under ultra-low bitrate conditions. To mitigate this, generative compression methods leveraging semantic priors from pretrained models have emerged as a promising paradigm. However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by a tradeoff between semantic faithfulness and perceptual realism. Methods based on explicit representations preserve content structure but often lack fine-grained textures, whereas implicit methods can synthesize visually plausible details at the cost of semantic drift. In this work, we propose a unified framework that bridges this gap by coherently integrating explicit and implicit representations in a training-free manner. Specifically, We condition a diffusion model on explicit high-level semantics while employing reverse-channel coding to implicitly convey fine-grained details. Moreover, we introduce a plug-in encoder that enables flexible control of the distortion-perception tradeoff by modulating the implicit information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art rate-perception performance, outperforming existing methods and surpassing DiffC by 29.92%, 19.33%, and 20.89% in DISTS BD-Rate on the Kodak, DIV2K, and CLIC2020 datasets, respectively.

Motivation: Existing Video LLMs for Temporal Video Grounding rely on matching start and end frames separately using exact timestamps, which fails to capture the semantic continuity and integrity of events, leading to ambiguities in localization.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) Special <event> token that aggregates information from all frames of a query event to preserve semantic continuity; (2) Savitzky-Golay smoothing to reduce noise in token-to-frame similarities; (3) Multi-grained frame feature aggregation to enhance matching reliability and compensate for compression-induced information loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that E.M.Ground consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Video LLMs by significant margins.

Conclusion: E.M.Ground addresses the limitations of existing methods by focusing on holistic and coherent event perception, leading to more accurate temporal video grounding through better semantic understanding and noise reduction.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs), Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which aims to precisely localize time segments corresponding to query events, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often match start and end frames by comparing frame features with two separate tokens, relying heavily on exact timestamps. However, this approach fails to capture the event's semantic continuity and integrity, leading to ambiguities. To address this, we propose E.M.Ground, a novel Vid-LLM for TVG that focuses on holistic and coherent event perception. E.M.Ground introduces three key innovations: (i) a special <event> token that aggregates information from all frames of a query event, preserving semantic continuity for accurate event matching; (ii) Savitzky-Golay smoothing to reduce noise in token-to-frame similarities across timestamps, improving prediction accuracy; (iii) multi-grained frame feature aggregation to enhance matching reliability and temporal understanding, compensating for compression-induced information loss. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that E.M.Ground consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs by significant margins.

*Jiahao Nie,Guanqiao Fu,Wenbin An,Yap-Peng Tan,Alex C. Kot,Shijian Lu*

TL;DR: MPA proposes a multi-view progressive adaptation method for cross-domain few-shot segmentation that improves adaptation through hybrid progressive augmentation and dual-chain multi-view prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-domain few-shot segmentation methods struggle with limited target domain data diversity and substantial domain gaps, which hinder effective adaptation from source to target domains.

Method: Two key components: (1) Hybrid Progressive Augmentation - generates increasingly diverse and complex views through cumulative strong augmentations; (2) Dual-chain Multi-view Prediction - leverages complex views through sequential and parallel learning paths with extensive supervision.

Result: MPA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+7.0%) in extensive experiments, demonstrating effective adaptation of few-shot capability to target domains.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-view progressive adaptation approach successfully addresses cross-domain few-shot segmentation challenges by progressively adapting few-shot capability from both data and strategy perspectives.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation aims to segment categories in data-scarce domains conditioned on a few exemplars. Typical methods first establish few-shot capability in a large-scale source domain and then adapt it to target domains. However, due to the limited quantity and diversity of target samples, existing methods still exhibit constrained performance. Moreover, the source-trained model's initially weak few-shot capability in target domains, coupled with substantial domain gaps, severely hinders the effective utilization of target samples and further impedes adaptation. To this end, we propose Multi-view Progressive Adaptation, which progressively adapts few-shot capability to target domains from both data and strategy perspectives. (i) From the data perspective, we introduce Hybrid Progressive Augmentation, which progressively generates more diverse and complex views through cumulative strong augmentations, thereby creating increasingly challenging learning scenarios. (ii) From the strategy perspective, we design Dual-chain Multi-view Prediction, which fully leverages these progressively complex views through sequential and parallel learning paths under extensive supervision. By jointly enforcing prediction consistency across diverse and complex views, MPA achieves both robust and accurate adaptation to target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPA effectively adapts few-shot capability to target domains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+7.0%).

TL;DR: CPS improves cross-domain few-shot segmentation by adaptively sparsifying dense point prompts for SAM based on reference exemplars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAM-based few-shot segmentation methods using dense point matching perform poorly in cross-domain scenarios (medical/satellite images) due to domain shifts disrupting SAM's learned point-image interactions.

Method: Proposes Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS), a training-free approach that uses reference exemplars with ground-truth masks to adaptively sparsify dense matched points, guiding SAM interactions for cross-domain images.

Result: Extensive experiments show CPS outperforms existing training-free SAM-based methods across diverse cross-domain few-shot segmentation datasets.

Conclusion: Adaptive point sparsification guided by reference exemplars effectively addresses SAM's limitations in cross-domain few-shot segmentation without requiring training.

Abstract: Motivated by the success of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in promptable segmentation, recent studies leverage SAM to develop training-free solutions for few-shot segmentation, which aims to predict object masks in the target image based on a few reference exemplars. These SAM-based methods typically rely on point matching between reference and target images and use the matched dense points as prompts for mask prediction. However, we observe that dense points perform poorly in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS), where target images are from medical or satellite domains. We attribute this issue to large domain shifts that disrupt the point-image interactions learned by SAM, and find that point density plays a crucial role under such conditions. To address this challenge, we propose Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS), a training-free approach that adaptively guides SAM interactions for cross-domain images based on reference exemplars. Leveraging ground-truth masks, the reference images provide reliable guidance for adaptively sparsifying dense matched points, enabling more accurate segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPS outperforms existing training-free SAM-based methods across diverse CD-FSS datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object pose estimation is critical for VR and embodied AI, but current score-based generative models suffer from high sampling costs and limited efficiency despite solving rotational symmetry ambiguity.

Method: Uses flow-matching generative model for efficient pose generation along optimal transport paths, then refines candidates by casting sampling as a Markov decision process with proximal policy optimization, treating flow field as learnable policy and mapping estimator to value network.

Result: Achieves favorable performance on REAL275 benchmark while significantly reducing computational cost, and can be adapted to object pose tracking with competitive results.

Conclusion: RFM-Pose provides an efficient framework for category-level 6D object pose estimation that combines flow-matching generation with reinforcement learning-based refinement, offering both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a fundamental problem in computer vision and plays a critical role in virtual reality and embodied intelligence, where agents must understand and interact with objects in 3D space. Recently, score based generative models have to some extent solved the rotational symmetry ambiguity problem in category level pose estimation, but their efficiency remains limited by the high sampling cost of score-based diffusion. In this work, we propose a new framework, RFM-Pose, that accelerates category-level 6D object pose generation while actively evaluating sampled hypotheses. To improve sampling efficiency, we adopt a flow-matching generative model and generate pose candidates along an optimal transport path from a simple prior to the pose distribution. To further refine these candidates, we cast the flow-matching sampling process as a Markov decision process and apply proximal policy optimization to fine-tune the sampling policy. In particular, we interpret the flow field as a learnable policy and map an estimator to a value network, enabling joint optimization of pose generation and hypothesis scoring within a reinforcement learning framework. Experiments on the REAL275 benchmark demonstrate that RFM-Pose achieves favorable performance while significantly reducing computational cost. Moreover, similar to prior work, our approach can be readily adapted to object pose tracking and attains competitive results in this setting.

TL;DR: Proposes freezing feature extractor and fine-tuning prototypes instead, using dual-calibration offsets to evolve static centroids into dynamic, learnable components for few-shot class-incremental learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FSCIL methods use frozen pre-trained feature extractors with static prototypes that suffer from representation bias. Recent prompt-based tuning has limited capacity to enhance global discriminative power due to extreme data scarcity. The authors argue the main challenge is optimizing decision regions in a static feature space rather than feature acquisition.

Method: Freeze the feature extractor and fine-tune prototypes using a dual-calibration method with class-specific and task-aware offsets. This evolves static centroids into dynamic, learnable components that synergistically improve discriminative capacity for incremental classes.

Result: Extensive results demonstrate superior performance across multiple benchmarks while requiring minimal learnable parameters.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel perspective shift in FSCIL: focusing on prototype optimization rather than feature acquisition, achieving better performance with efficient parameter usage through dynamic prototype fine-tuning.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) seeks to continuously learn new classes from very limited samples while preserving previously acquired knowledge. Traditional methods often utilize a frozen pre-trained feature extractor to generate static class prototypes, which suffer from the inherent representation bias of the backbone. While recent prompt-based tuning methods attempt to adapt the backbone via minimal parameter updates, given the constraint of extreme data scarcity, the model's capacity to assimilate novel information and substantively enhance its global discriminative power is inherently limited. In this paper, we propose a novel shift in perspective: freezing the feature extractor while fine-tuning the prototypes. We argue that the primary challenge in FSCIL is not feature acquisition, but rather the optimization of decision regions within a static, high-quality feature space. To this end, we introduce an efficient prototype fine-tuning framework that evolves static centroids into dynamic, learnable components. The framework employs a dual-calibration method consisting of class-specific and task-aware offsets. These components function synergistically to improve the discriminative capacity of prototypes for ongoing incremental classes. Extensive results demonstrate that our method attains superior performance across multiple benchmarks while requiring minimal learnable parameters.

Motivation: Current MLLMs for universal multimodal retrieval suffer from high computational costs due to processing many visual tokens, hindering practical applications despite their promising capabilities.

Method: Two synergistic pillars: 1) Efficient MLLM architecture with visual token compression to reduce inference latency/memory, 2) Multi-stage progressive training (continue pretraining → contrastive pretraining with hard negatives → task-aware fine-tuning using MLLM-as-a-Judge for data curation).

Result: Model outperforms existing methods by a large margin while being more inference-efficient, achieving state-of-the-art performance in universal multimodal embedding.

Conclusion: Magic-MM-Embedding successfully addresses the efficiency-performance trade-off in multimodal retrieval, offering a practical solution for real-world applications through architectural optimization and sophisticated training strategy.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown immense promise in universal multimodal retrieval, which aims to find relevant items of various modalities for a given query. But their practical application is often hindered by the substantial computational cost incurred from processing a large number of tokens from visual inputs. In this paper, we propose Magic-MM-Embedding, a series of novel models that achieve both high efficiency and state-of-the-art performance in universal multimodal embedding. Our approach is built on two synergistic pillars: (1) a highly efficient MLLM architecture incorporating visual token compression to drastically reduce inference latency and memory footprint, and (2) a multi-stage progressive training strategy designed to not only recover but significantly boost performance. This coarse-to-fine training paradigm begins with extensive continue pretraining to restore multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, progresses to large-scale contrastive pretraining and hard negative mining to enhance discriminative power, and culminates in a task-aware fine-tuning stage guided by an MLLM-as-a-Judge for precise data curation. Comprehensive experiments show that our model outperforms existing methods by a large margin while being more inference-efficient.

TL;DR: Fast-SAM3D accelerates 3D reconstruction by addressing multi-level heterogeneity in SAM3D's inference pipeline through training-free, dynamic computation alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3D enables scalable 3D reconstruction but suffers from prohibitive inference latency. Generic acceleration strategies fail due to the pipeline's inherent multi-level heterogeneity, including shape-layout kinematic differences, texture refinement sparsity, and spectral variance across geometries.

Method: Fast-SAM3D introduces three heterogeneity-aware mechanisms: (1) Modality-Aware Step Caching to decouple structural evolution from layout updates, (2) Joint Spatiotemporal Token Carving to focus refinement on high-entropy regions, and (3) Spectral-Aware Token Aggregation to adapt decoding resolution based on geometric complexity.

Result: Fast-SAM3D achieves up to 2.67× end-to-end speedup with negligible fidelity loss, establishing a new Pareto frontier for efficient single-view 3D generation.

Conclusion: The work presents the first systematic investigation of SAM3D's inference dynamics and demonstrates that addressing pipeline heterogeneity through dynamic computation alignment enables significant acceleration without compromising reconstruction quality.

Abstract: SAM3D enables scalable, open-world 3D reconstruction from complex scenes, yet its deployment is hindered by prohibitive inference latency. In this work, we conduct the \textbf{first systematic investigation} into its inference dynamics, revealing that generic acceleration strategies are brittle in this context. We demonstrate that these failures stem from neglecting the pipeline's inherent multi-level \textbf{heterogeneity}: the kinematic distinctiveness between shape and layout, the intrinsic sparsity of texture refinement, and the spectral variance across geometries. To address this, we present \textbf{Fast-SAM3D}, a training-free framework that dynamically aligns computation with instantaneous generation complexity. Our approach integrates three heterogeneity-aware mechanisms: (1) \textit{Modality-Aware Step Caching} to decouple structural evolution from sensitive layout updates; (2) \textit{Joint Spatiotemporal Token Carving} to concentrate refinement on high-entropy regions; and (3) \textit{Spectral-Aware Token Aggregation} to adapt decoding resolution.

TL;DR: FlashBlock reduces attention computation in block diffusion by reusing stable attention outputs from tokens outside the current block, improving throughput by up to 1.44× with minimal quality impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Block diffusion improves inference efficiency for long-form content generation, but still suffers from substantial overhead from repeatedly computing attention over growing KV caches in long-context settings.

Method: Identifies cross-step redundancy in block diffusion where attention outputs from tokens outside current blocks remain stable across diffusion steps. Proposes FlashBlock, a cached block-external attention mechanism that reuses these stable attention outputs to reduce computation and KV cache access.

Result: Experiments on diffusion language models and video generation show up to 1.44× higher token throughput, up to 1.6× reduction in attention time, with negligible impact on generation quality. Can be combined with sparse attention for further improvements.

Conclusion: FlashBlock effectively reduces attention computation overhead in block diffusion by exploiting cross-step redundancy, offering significant efficiency gains for long-form content generation without compromising quality.

Abstract: Generating long-form content, such as minute-long videos and extended texts, is increasingly important for modern generative models. Block diffusion improves inference efficiency via KV caching and block-wise causal inference and has been widely adopted in diffusion language models and video generation. However, in long-context settings, block diffusion still incurs substantial overhead from repeatedly computing attention over a growing KV cache. We identify an underexplored property of block diffusion: cross-step redundancy of attention within a block. Our analysis shows that attention outputs from tokens outside the current block remain largely stable across diffusion steps, while block-internal attention varies significantly. Based on this observation, we propose FlashBlock, a cached block-external attention mechanism that reuses stable attention output, reducing attention computation and KV cache access without modifying the diffusion process. Moreover, FlashBlock is orthogonal to sparse attention and can be combined as a complementary residual reuse strategy, substantially improving model accuracy under aggressive sparsification. Experiments on diffusion language models and video generation demonstrate up to 1.44$\times$ higher token throughput and up to 1.6$\times$ reduction in attention time, with negligible impact on generation quality.

Conclusion: Wid3R provides a generalizable solution for wide FOV camera 3D reconstruction, overcoming limitations of perspective-only methods and enabling direct processing of 360 imagery without calibration/undistortion requirements.

Abstract: We present Wid3R, a feed-forward neural network for visual geometry reconstruction that supports wide field-of-view camera models. Prior methods typically assume that input images are rectified or captured with pinhole cameras, since both their architectures and training datasets are tailored to perspective images only. These assumptions limit their applicability in real-world scenarios that use fisheye or panoramic cameras and often require careful calibration and undistortion. In contrast, Wid3R is a generalizable multi-view 3D estimation method that can model wide field-of-view camera types. Our approach leverages a ray representation with spherical harmonics and a novel camera model token within the network, enabling distortion-aware 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, Wid3R is the first multi-view foundation model to support feed-forward 3D reconstruction directly from 360 imagery.

TL;DR: MTPano is a multi-task panoramic foundation model that addresses data scarcity and task interference in panoramic scene understanding through label-free training using perspective priors and a dual-branch architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic scene understanding faces challenges due to: 1) scarcity of high-resolution multi-task annotations, 2) geometric distortions when adapting perspective models to panoramic domains, and 3) unexplored relationships between dense prediction tasks in spherical spaces.

Method: 1) Label-free training pipeline using perspective patches: project panoramic images to perspective patches, generate pseudo-labels with off-the-shelf foundation models, then re-project as supervision. 2) Panoramic Dual BridgeNet: separates rotation-invariant (depth, segmentation) and rotation-variant (normals) tasks with geometry-aware modulation layers. 3) ERP token mixers with dual-branch BridgeNet and gradient truncation to handle distortions. 4) Auxiliary tasks (image gradient, point map) to enhance cross-task learning.

Result: MTPano achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and delivers competitive results against task-specific panoramic specialist foundation models.

Conclusion: The proposed MTPano effectively addresses panoramic scene understanding challenges through a novel label-free training approach and architecture that handles task interference and geometric distortions, establishing a robust multi-task panoramic foundation model.

Abstract: Comprehensive panoramic scene understanding is critical for immersive applications, yet it remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-resolution, multi-task annotations. While perspective foundation models have achieved success through data scaling, directly adapting them to the panoramic domain often fails due to severe geometric distortions and coordinate system discrepancies. Furthermore, the underlying relations between diverse dense prediction tasks in spherical spaces are underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose MTPano, a robust multi-task panoramic foundation model established by a label-free training pipeline. First, to circumvent data scarcity, we leverage powerful perspective dense priors. We project panoramic images into perspective patches to generate accurate, domain-gap-free pseudo-labels using off-the-shelf foundation models, which are then re-projected to serve as patch-wise supervision. Second, to tackle the interference between task types, we categorize tasks into rotation-invariant (e.g., depth, segmentation) and rotation-variant (e.g., surface normals) groups. We introduce the Panoramic Dual BridgeNet, which disentangles these feature streams via geometry-aware modulation layers that inject absolute position and ray direction priors. To handle the distortion from equirectangular projections (ERP), we incorporate ERP token mixers followed by a dual-branch BridgeNet for interactions with gradient truncation, facilitating beneficial cross-task information sharing while blocking conflicting gradients from incompatible task attributes. Additionally, we introduce auxiliary tasks (image gradient, point map, etc.) to fertilize the cross-task learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTPano achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and delivers competitive results against task-specific panoramic specialist foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAIR framework reframes concept erasure from simple removal to consistency-preserving semantic realignment using unsafe-safe pairs, achieving better structural and semantic preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure approaches focus on removing unsafe concepts without providing guidance toward safe alternatives, leading to failure in preserving structural and semantic consistency between original and erased generations.

Method: PAIR uses unsafe-safe pairs: (1) Paired Semantic Realignment maps target concepts to semantically aligned safe anchors, and (2) Fisher-weighted Initialization for DoRA initializes parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation matrices using unsafe-safe pairs to encourage safe alternatives while suppressing unsafe concepts.

Result: Extensive experiments show PAIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving effective concept erasure while preserving structural integrity, semantic coherence, and generation quality.

Conclusion: The PAIR framework successfully reframes concept erasure from simple removal to consistency-preserving semantic realignment, enabling fine-grained erasure that removes only targeted concepts while maintaining overall semantic consistency.

Abstract: With the increasing versatility of text-to-image diffusion models, the ability to selectively erase undesirable concepts (e.g., harmful content) has become indispensable. However, existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on removing unsafe concepts without providing guidance toward corresponding safe alternatives, which often leads to failure in preserving the structural and semantic consistency between the original and erased generations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, PAIRed Erasing (PAIR), which reframes concept erasure from simple removal to consistency-preserving semantic realignment using unsafe-safe pairs. We first generate safe counterparts from unsafe inputs while preserving structural and semantic fidelity, forming paired unsafe-safe multimodal data. Leveraging these pairs, we introduce two key components: (1) Paired Semantic Realignment, a guided objective that uses unsafe-safe pairs to explicitly map target concepts to semantically aligned safe anchors; and (2) Fisher-weighted Initialization for DoRA, which initializes parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation matrices using unsafe-safe pairs, encouraging the generation of safe alternatives while selectively suppressing unsafe concepts. Together, these components enable fine-grained erasure that removes only the targeted concepts while maintaining overall semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving effective concept erasure while preserving structural integrity, semantic coherence, and generation quality.

TL;DR: APEX introduces adaptive prototype learning with MDL-based complexity determination and posterior-aware scoring to overcome limitations of static homogeneity and learning-inference disconnect in OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype-based OOD detection methods suffer from two fundamental flaws: Static Homogeneity Assumption (fixed representational resources for all classes) and Learning-Inference Disconnect (discarding prototype quality knowledge at inference), which limit model capacity and performance.

Method: APEX uses a Two-Stage Repair process with two key innovations: (1) Adaptive Prototype Manifold (APM) that leverages Minimum Description Length principle to automatically determine optimal prototype complexity K_c* for each class, and (2) Posterior-Aware OOD Scoring (PAOS) mechanism that quantifies prototype quality (cohesion and separation) to bridge learning-inference disconnect.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks like CIFAR-100 validate APEX's superiority, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in OOD detection.

Conclusion: APEX successfully addresses fundamental limitations of prototype-based OOD detection methods through adaptive prototype learning and quality-aware scoring, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task for the safe deployment of machine learning models in the real world. Existing prototype-based representation learning methods have demonstrated exceptional performance. Specifically, we identify two fundamental flaws that universally constrain these methods: the Static Homogeneity Assumption (fixed representational resources for all classes) and the Learning-Inference Disconnect (discarding rich prototype quality knowledge at inference). These flaws fundamentally limit the model's capacity and performance. To address these issues, we propose APEX (Adaptive Prototype for eXtensive OOD Detection), a novel OOD detection framework designed via a Two-Stage Repair process to optimize the learned feature manifold. APEX introduces two key innovations to address these respective flaws: (1) an Adaptive Prototype Manifold (APM), which leverages the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to automatically determine the optimal prototype complexity $K_c^*$ for each class, thereby fundamentally resolving prototype collision; and (2) a Posterior-Aware OOD Scoring (PAOS) mechanism, which quantifies prototype quality (cohesion and separation) to bridge the learning-inference disconnect. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-100 validate the superiority of our method, where APEX achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

### [30] [Multimodal Latent Reasoning via Hierarchical Visual Cues Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05359)
*Yiming Zhang,Qiangyu Yan,Borui Jiang,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HIVE introduces a multimodal latent reasoning framework that replaces explicit textual chains of thought with hierarchical visual cue injection for more efficient, grounded reasoning in complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs use inefficient "fast thinking" paradigms with end-to-end generation or language-centric chains of thought that are verbose and prone to hallucinations. There's a need for more robust reasoning that integrates multimodal signals seamlessly in latent space.

Method: Proposes HIVE framework that recursively extends transformer blocks to create internal loops for iterative reasoning refinement. Injects hierarchical visual cues from global scene context to fine-grained regional details directly into latent representations, enabling grounded multi-step inference in aligned latent space.

Result: Extensive evaluations show test-time scaling is effective when incorporating vision knowledge, and integrating hierarchical information significantly enhances model understanding of complex scenes.

Conclusion: HIVE enables "slow thinking" reasoning in multimodal models by grounding inference in hierarchical visual cues within latent space, addressing limitations of current language-centric reasoning approaches.

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has enabled impressive perception capabilities. However, their reasoning process often remains a "fast thinking" paradigm, reliant on end-to-end generation or explicit, language-centric chains of thought (CoT), which can be inefficient, verbose, and prone to hallucination. This work posits that robust reasoning should evolve within a latent space, integrating multimodal signals seamlessly. We propose multimodal latent reasoning via HIerarchical Visual cuEs injection (\emph{HIVE}), a novel framework that instills deliberate, "slow thinking" without depending on superficial textual rationales. Our method recursively extends transformer blocks, creating an internal loop for iterative reasoning refinement. Crucially, it injectively grounds this process with hierarchical visual cues from global scene context to fine-grained regional details directly into the model's latent representations. This enables the model to perform grounded, multi-step inference entirely in the aligned latent space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that test-time scaling is effective when incorporating vision knowledge, and that integrating hierarchical information significantly enhances the model's understanding of complex scenes.

### [31] [Breaking Semantic Hegemony: Decoupling Principal and Residual Subspaces for Generalized OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05360)
*Ningkang Peng,Xiaoqian Peng,Yuhao Zhang,Qianfeng Yu,Feng Xing,Peirong Ma,Xichen Yang,Yi Chen,Tingyu Lu,Yanhui Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a "Simplicity Paradox" in OOD detection where SOTA models are sensitive to semantically subtle OOD samples but blind to structurally distinct yet simple samples or sensor noise. They propose D-KNN, a training-free geometric decoupling framework that separates semantic components from structural residuals to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature-based OOD detection methods suffer from a counter-intuitive "Simplicity Paradox" - they perform well on semantically subtle OOD samples but fail dramatically on structurally distinct yet simple samples or high-frequency sensor noise. This "Geometric Blindness" is attributed to "Semantic Hegemony" in deep feature spaces, where semantic components dominate and mask structural distribution shifts.

Method: Proposes D-KNN, a training-free, plug-and-play geometric decoupling framework. It uses orthogonal decomposition to explicitly separate semantic components from structural residuals, and introduces a dual-space calibration mechanism to reactivate sensitivity to weak residual signals. The method is based on theoretical analysis through the lens of Neural Collapse, showing that spectral concentration bias masks structural distribution shift signals.

Result: D-KNN establishes new SOTA performance on both CIFAR and ImageNet benchmarks. It reduces FPR95 from 31.3% to 2.3% when resolving the Simplicity Paradox, and boosts detection performance (AUROC) from 79.7% to 94.9% when addressing sensor failures like Gaussian noise.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the Simplicity Paradox in OOD detection by breaking Semantic Hegemony through geometric decoupling. D-KNN's orthogonal decomposition approach effectively separates semantic and structural components, enabling robust detection of both semantically subtle and structurally distinct OOD samples while maintaining training-free practicality.

Abstract: While feature-based post-hoc methods have made significant strides in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, we uncover a counter-intuitive Simplicity Paradox in existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models: these models exhibit keen sensitivity in distinguishing semantically subtle OOD samples but suffer from severe Geometric Blindness when confronting structurally distinct yet semantically simple samples or high-frequency sensor noise. We attribute this phenomenon to Semantic Hegemony within the deep feature space and reveal its mathematical essence through the lens of Neural Collapse. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the spectral concentration bias, induced by the high variance of the principal subspace, numerically masks the structural distribution shift signals that should be significant in the residual subspace. To address this issue, we propose D-KNN, a training-free, plug-and-play geometric decoupling framework. This method utilizes orthogonal decomposition to explicitly separate semantic components from structural residuals and introduces a dual-space calibration mechanism to reactivate the model's sensitivity to weak residual signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-KNN effectively breaks Semantic Hegemony, establishing new SOTA performance on both CIFAR and ImageNet benchmarks. Notably, in resolving the Simplicity Paradox, it reduces the FPR95 from 31.3% to 2.3%; when addressing sensor failures such as Gaussian noise, it boosts the detection performance (AUROC) from a baseline of 79.7% to 94.9%.

TL;DR: CityGenAgent is a natural language-driven framework for hierarchical procedural generation of high-quality 3D cities using interpretable block and building programs with two-stage learning (SFT + RL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated 3D city generation is crucial for autonomous driving, VR, and embodied AI, but existing methods lack high-fidelity asset creation, controllability, and manipulation capabilities.

Method: Hierarchical decomposition into Block Program and Building Program with two-stage learning: 1) Supervised Fine-Tuning for valid program generation, 2) Reinforcement Learning with Spatial Alignment and Visual Consistency rewards for spatial reasoning and text-visual alignment.

Result: Superior semantic alignment, visual quality, and controllability compared to existing methods, with support for natural language editing and manipulation.

Conclusion: CityGenAgent establishes a robust foundation for scalable 3D city generation through interpretable hierarchical programs and two-stage learning strategy.

Abstract: The automated generation of interactive 3D cities is a critical challenge with broad applications in autonomous driving, virtual reality, and embodied intelligence. While recent advances in generative models and procedural techniques have improved the realism of city generation, existing methods often struggle with high-fidelity asset creation, controllability, and manipulation. In this work, we introduce CityGenAgent, a natural language-driven framework for hierarchical procedural generation of high-quality 3D cities. Our approach decomposes city generation into two interpretable components, Block Program and Building Program. To ensure structural correctness and semantic alignment, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We train BlockGen and BuildingGen to generate valid programs that adhere to schema constraints, including non-self-intersecting polygons and complete fields; (2) Reinforcement Learning (RL). We design Spatial Alignment Reward to enhance spatial reasoning ability and Visual Consistency Reward to bridge the gap between textual descriptions and the visual modality. Benefiting from the programs and the models' generalization, CityGenAgent supports natural language editing and manipulation. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate superior semantic alignment, visual quality, and controllability compared to existing methods, establishing a robust foundation for scalable 3D city generation.

*Xiaoxuan He,Siming Fu,Wanli Li,Zhiyuan Li,Dacheng Yin,Kang Rong,Fengyun Rao,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAIL is a self-amplified iterative learning framework that enables diffusion models to act as their own teachers using minimal human feedback, achieving effective alignment without external reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning diffusion models with human preferences is challenging when reward models are unavailable or expensive to obtain, and collecting large-scale preference datasets is prohibitively expensive. The paper explores whether effective alignment can be achieved using only minimal human feedback by leveraging diffusion models' own latent capabilities.

Method: SAIL operates in a closed-loop manner: starting from a minimal seed set of human-annotated preference pairs, the model progressively generates diverse samples, self-annotates preferences based on its evolving understanding, and refines itself using this self-augmented dataset. A ranked preference mixup strategy is introduced to balance exploration with adherence to initial human priors and prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: SAIL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks while using only 6% of the preference data required by existing approaches, demonstrating that diffusion models possess remarkable self-improvement capabilities.

Conclusion: Diffusion models possess inherent self-improvement capabilities that, when properly harnessed through frameworks like SAIL, can effectively replace both large-scale human annotation and external reward models for alignment with human preferences.

Abstract: Aligning diffusion models with human preferences remains challenging, particularly when reward models are unavailable or impractical to obtain, and collecting large-scale preference datasets is prohibitively expensive. \textit{This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve effective alignment using only minimal human feedback, without auxiliary reward models, by unlocking the latent capabilities within diffusion models themselves?} In this paper, we propose \textbf{SAIL} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}mplified \textbf{I}terative \textbf{L}earning), a novel framework that enables diffusion models to act as their own teachers through iterative self-improvement. Starting from a minimal seed set of human-annotated preference pairs, SAIL operates in a closed-loop manner where the model progressively generates diverse samples, self-annotates preferences based on its evolving understanding, and refines itself using this self-augmented dataset. To ensure robust learning and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a ranked preference mixup strategy that carefully balances exploration with adherence to initial human priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAIL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks while using merely 6\% of the preference data required by existing approaches, revealing that diffusion models possess remarkable self-improvement capabilities that, when properly harnessed, can effectively replace both large-scale human annotation and external reward models.

### [34] [VRIQ: Benchmarking and Analyzing Visual-Reasoning IQ of VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05382)
*Tina Khezresmaeilzadeh,Jike Zhong,Konstantinos Psounis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform poorly on visual reasoning tasks, especially abstract puzzles (28% accuracy), with failures mainly due to perception limitations rather than reasoning deficits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether VLMs can reliably perform nonverbal reasoning, as recent progress raises questions about their visual reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduce VRIQ benchmark with abstract puzzle-style and natural-image reasoning tasks, plus diagnostic probes targeting perception and reasoning components to analyze failure sources.

Result: VLMs perform near random on abstract puzzles (28% accuracy) and weakly on natural tasks (45%). 56% of failures from perception alone, 43% from both perception and reasoning, only 1% from reasoning alone. Tool-augmented reasoning shows modest improvements.

Conclusion: Current VLMs remain unreliable abstract reasoners primarily due to perception limitations, not reasoning deficits. The benchmark provides a principled basis for improving visual reasoning in multimodal systems.

Abstract: Recent progress in Vision Language Models (VLMs) has raised the question of whether they can reliably perform nonverbal reasoning. To this end, we introduce VRIQ (Visual Reasoning IQ), a novel benchmark designed to assess and analyze the visual reasoning ability of VLMs. We evaluate models on two sets of tasks: abstract puzzle-style and natural-image reasoning tasks. We find that on abstract puzzles, performance remains near random with an average accuracy of around 28%, while natural tasks yield better but still weak results with 45% accuracy. We also find that tool-augmented reasoning demonstrates only modest improvements. To uncover the source of this weakness, we introduce diagnostic probes targeting perception and reasoning. Our analysis demonstrates that around 56% of failures arise from perception alone, 43% from both perception and reasoning, and only a mere 1% from reasoning alone. This motivates us to design fine-grained diagnostic probe questions targeting specific perception categories (e.g., shape, count, position, 3D/depth), revealing that certain categories cause more failures than others. Our benchmark and analysis establish that current VLMs, even with visual reasoning tools, remain unreliable abstract reasoners, mostly due to perception limitations, and offer a principled basis for improving visual reasoning in multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Memory-Execute-Review framework for Visual Language Navigation achieves state-of-the-art performance by balancing success rate and generalization, outperforming both supervised fine-tuning and training-free methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLN methods struggle to simultaneously achieve high success rates (like SFT methods) and good generalization (like training-free methods). There's a need for a framework that can excel at both aspects.

Method: Proposes a Memory-Execute-Review framework with three components: hierarchical memory module for information support, execute module for routine decision-making, and review module for handling abnormal situations and behavior correction.

Result: Achieved 7% and 5% absolute SR improvements over baselines under training-free and zero-shot settings across 4 datasets. On HM3D_v0.1 and HM3D_OVON, SR improved by 8% and 6% under zero-shot. Outperformed all methods on MP3D and HM3D_OVON, achieving leadership in both SR and generalization.

Conclusion: The Memory-Execute-Review framework successfully addresses the trade-off between success rate and generalization in VLN, achieving comprehensive performance improvements across multiple challenging datasets and settings.

Abstract: Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is one of the fundamental capabilities for embodied intelligence and a critical challenge that urgently needs to be addressed. However, existing methods are still unsatisfactory in terms of both success rate (SR) and generalization: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) approaches typically achieve higher SR, while Training-Free (TF) approaches often generalize better, but it is difficult to obtain both simultaneously. To this end, we propose a Memory-Execute-Review framework. It consists of three parts: a hierarchical memory module for providing information support, an execute module for routine decision-making and actions, and a review module for handling abnormal situations and correcting behavior. We validated the effectiveness of this framework on the Object Goal Navigation task. Across 4 datasets, our average SR achieved absolute improvements of 7% and 5% compared to all baseline methods under TF and Zero-Shot (ZS) settings, respectively. On the most commonly used HM3D_v0.1 and the more challenging open vocabulary dataset HM3D_OVON, the SR improved by 8% and 6%, under ZS settings. Furthermore, on the MP3D and HM3D_OVON datasets, our method not only outperformed all TF methods but also surpassed all SFT methods, achieving comprehensive leadership in both SR (5% and 2%) and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dolphin-v2 is an improved two-stage document parsing model that handles both digital-born and photographed documents with better layout analysis, finer-grained element detection, and hybrid parsing strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current document parsing field is fragmented with specialized models requiring complex selection, and existing two-stage approaches fail to handle distorted/photographed documents due to reliance on axis-aligned bounding boxes.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Joint document type classification (digital-born vs photographed) with layout analysis and reading order prediction; 2) Hybrid parsing - photographed documents parsed holistically as complete pages, digital-born documents parsed element-wise in parallel guided by layout anchors.

Result: +14.78 points overall improvement on OmniDocBench, 91% error reduction on photographed documents, maintains efficient inference through parallel processing, evaluated on DocPTBench, OmniDocBench, and RealDoc-160 benchmark.

Conclusion: Dolphin-v2 substantially improves document parsing by addressing photographed document handling, adding finer-grained element detection with semantic attributes, and preserving code block indentation while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Document parsing has garnered widespread attention as vision-language models (VLMs) advance OCR capabilities. However, the field remains fragmented across dozens of specialized models with varying strengths, forcing users to navigate complex model selection and limiting system scalability. Moreover, existing two-stage approaches depend on axis-aligned bounding boxes for layout detection, failing to handle distorted or photographed documents effectively. To this end, we present Dolphin-v2, a two-stage document image parsing model that substantially improves upon the original Dolphin. In the first stage, Dolphin-v2 jointly performs document type classification (digital-born versus photographed) alongside layout analysis. For digital-born documents, it conducts finer-grained element detection with reading order prediction. In the second stage, we employ a hybrid parsing strategy: photographed documents are parsed holistically as complete pages to handle geometric distortions, while digital-born documents undergo element-wise parallel parsing guided by the detected layout anchors, enabling efficient content extraction. Compared with the original Dolphin, Dolphin-v2 introduces several crucial enhancements: (1) robust parsing of photographed documents via holistic page-level understanding, (2) finer-grained element detection (21 categories) with semantic attribute extraction such as author information and document metadata, and (3) code block recognition with indentation preservation, which existing systems typically lack. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on DocPTBench, OmniDocBench, and our self-constructed RealDoc-160 benchmark. The results demonstrate substantial improvements: +14.78 points overall on the challenging OmniDocBench and 91% error reduction on photographed documents, while maintaining efficient inference through parallel processing.

Motivation: MRI lacks electron density information needed for radiotherapy dose calculation, forcing reliance on combined MRI-CT workflows that introduce registration errors and complexity. Synthetic CT generation from MRI could enable MRI-only planning but faces challenges due to nonlinear MRI-CT relationships and anatomical variability.

Method: Parallel Swin Transformer-Enhanced Med2Transformer integrates convolutional encoding with dual Swin Transformer branches to model both local anatomical details and long-range contextual dependencies. Uses multi-scale shifted window attention with hierarchical feature aggregation to improve anatomical fidelity.

Result: Experiments on public and clinical datasets show higher image similarity and improved geometric accuracy compared to baseline methods. Dosimetric evaluation demonstrates clinically acceptable performance with mean target dose error of 1.69%.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively addresses challenges in synthetic CT generation from MRI, enabling MRI-only radiotherapy planning with clinically acceptable dosimetric accuracy, potentially simplifying current workflows and reducing registration uncertainty.

Abstract: MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast without ionizing radiation; however, the absence of electron density information limits its direct use for dose calculation. As a result, current radiotherapy workflows rely on combined MRI and CT acquisitions, increasing registration uncertainty and procedural complexity. Synthetic CT generation enables MRI only planning but remains challenging due to nonlinear MRI-CT relationships and anatomical variability. We propose Parallel Swin Transformer-Enhanced Med2Transformer, a 3D architecture that integrates convolutional encoding with dual Swin Transformer branches to model both local anatomical detail and long-range contextual dependencies. Multi-scale shifted window attention with hierarchical feature aggregation improves anatomical fidelity. Experiments on public and clinical datasets demonstrate higher image similarity and improved geometric accuracy compared with baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIRATR is an end-to-end 3D object detection framework that jointly estimates multi-class 6-DoF poses and class-specific parametric attributes from occlusion-affected point clouds, enabling task-relevant property estimation for robotic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between low-level geometric reasoning and actionable world models for robotic applications. Current 3D detection methods focus primarily on geometric localization but lack the ability to estimate task-relevant parametric properties of objects that are crucial for robotic manipulation and interaction.

Method: PIRATR extends PI3DETR to streamline parametric 3D object detection. It uses an end-to-end framework with modular, class-specific heads that jointly estimate multi-class 6-DoF poses and class-specific parametric attributes directly from point clouds. The method adjusts 3D models according to predefined rules based on estimated parameters, and employs a modular architecture that can be easily extended to new object types without pipeline redesign.

Result: The framework was validated on an automated forklift platform with three diverse object categories: crane grippers, loading platforms, and pallets. Trained entirely in synthetic environments, PIRATR generalized effectively to real outdoor LiDAR scans without additional fine-tuning, achieving a detection mAP of 0.919.

Conclusion: PIRATR establishes a new paradigm of pose-aware, parameterized perception that bridges geometric reasoning with actionable world models. It demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, simulation-trained perception systems for dynamic robotic environments, showing strong generalization from synthetic to real-world data without fine-tuning.

Abstract: We present PIRATR, an end-to-end 3D object detection framework for robotic use cases in point clouds. Extending PI3DETR, our method streamlines parametric 3D object detection by jointly estimating multi-class 6-DoF poses and class-specific parametric attributes directly from occlusion-affected point cloud data. This formulation enables not only geometric localization but also the estimation of task-relevant properties for parametric objects, such as a gripper's opening, where the 3D model is adjusted according to simple, predefined rules. The architecture employs modular, class-specific heads, making it straightforward to extend to novel object types without re-designing the pipeline. We validate PIRATR on an automated forklift platform, focusing on three structurally and functionally diverse categories: crane grippers, loading platforms, and pallets. Trained entirely in a synthetic environment, PIRATR generalizes effectively to real outdoor LiDAR scans, achieving a detection mAP of 0.919 without additional fine-tuning. PIRATR establishes a new paradigm of pose-aware, parameterized perception. This bridges the gap between low-level geometric reasoning and actionable world models, paving the way for scalable, simulation-trained perception systems that can be deployed in dynamic robotic environments.

TL;DR: Statistical flow matching for dataset distillation: A more efficient alternative to gradient matching that aligns statistical flows between class centers, achieving comparable performance with 10x lower memory and 4x faster runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous dataset distillation methods using linear gradient matching are computationally expensive, requiring loading thousands of real images and multiple augmentation passes per step, leading to high memory and runtime overhead.

Method: Statistical flow matching framework that optimizes synthetic images by aligning constant statistical flows from target class centers to non-target class centers. Also introduces classifier inheritance strategy that reuses original dataset's classifier with only a lightweight linear projector.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods with 10x lower GPU memory usage and 4x shorter runtime. Classifier inheritance provides substantial performance gains with minimal storage overhead.

Conclusion: Statistical flow matching offers a stable and efficient supervised learning framework for dataset distillation that significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Dataset distillation seeks to synthesize a highly compact dataset that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset on downstream tasks. For the classification task that use pre-trained self-supervised models as backbones, previous linear gradient matching optimizes synthetic images by encouraging them to mimic the gradient updates induced by real images on the linear classifier. However, this batch-level formulation requires loading thousands of real images and applying multiple rounds of differentiable augmentations to synthetic images at each distillation step, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we introduce statistical flow matching , a stable and efficient supervised learning framework that optimizes synthetic images by aligning constant statistical flows from target class centers to non-target class centers in the original data. Our approach loads raw statistics only once and performs a single augmentation pass on the synthetic data, achieving performance comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods with 10x lower GPU memory usage and 4x shorter runtime. Furthermore, we propose a classifier inheritance strategy that reuses the classifier trained on the original dataset for inference, requiring only an extremely lightweight linear projector and marginal storage while achieving substantial performance gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language navigation relies on detailed instructions, which contradicts real-world needs where agents should navigate with simple, high-level intents. Existing LLM-based methods suffer from short-sighted behaviors and training instability when extending supervision horizons.

Method: Proposes SparseVideoNav, which introduces video generation models to BVN for the first time. Uses sparse future generation spanning 20-second horizon for sub-second trajectory inference, achieving 27x speed-up over unoptimized video generation.

Result: Achieves 2.5x success rate of state-of-the-art LLM baselines on BVN tasks, with first realization of such capability in challenging night scenes. 27x speed-up compared to unoptimized video generation.

Conclusion: Video generation models are uniquely suitable for BVN due to inherent long-horizon supervision alignment, and SparseVideoNav successfully bridges the gap between theoretical capability and practical deployment through efficient sparse trajectory inference.

Abstract: Why must vision-language navigation be bound to detailed and verbose language instructions? While such details ease decision-making, they fundamentally contradict the goal for navigation in the real-world. Ideally, agents should possess the autonomy to navigate in unknown environments guided solely by simple and high-level intents. Realizing this ambition introduces a formidable challenge: Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN), where agents must locate distant, unseen targets without dense and step-by-step guidance. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods, though adept at following dense instructions, often suffer from short-sighted behaviors due to their reliance on short-horimzon supervision. Simply extending the supervision horizon, however, destabilizes LLM training. In this work, we identify that video generation models inherently benefit from long-horizon supervision to align with language instructions, rendering them uniquely suitable for BVN tasks. Capitalizing on this insight, we propose introducing the video generation model into this field for the first time. Yet, the prohibitive latency for generating videos spanning tens of seconds makes real-world deployment impractical. To bridge this gap, we propose SparseVideoNav, achieving sub-second trajectory inference guided by a generated sparse future spanning a 20-second horizon. This yields a remarkable 27x speed-up compared to the unoptimized counterpart. Extensive real-world zero-shot experiments demonstrate that SparseVideoNav achieves 2.5x the success rate of state-of-the-art LLM baselines on BVN tasks and marks the first realization of such capability in challenging night scenes.

TL;DR: MAD framework enables biologically plausible cell nuclei editing by regularizing feature trajectories within a learned manifold to handle correlated pathomics features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathomics features are difficult to interpret across clinical contexts, and existing diffusion models assume feature independence, which is violated by correlated pathomics features, leading to unrealistic artifacts when editing.

Method: Manifold-Aware Diffusion (MAD) framework that uses a VAE to learn a disentangled latent space, regularizes feature trajectories within this manifold, and guides a conditional diffusion model to synthesize high-fidelity images.

Result: The approach successfully navigates the manifold of pathomics features during editing, outperforms baseline methods in conditional feature editing, and preserves structural coherence.

Conclusion: MAD enables controllable and biologically plausible cell nuclei editing by addressing feature correlations through manifold-aware regularization, improving practical adoption of pathomics biomarkers.

Abstract: Pathomics is a recent approach that offers rich quantitative features beyond what black-box deep learning can provide, supporting more reproducible and explainable biomarkers in digital pathology. However, many derived features (e.g., "second-order moment") remain difficult to interpret, especially across different clinical contexts, which limits their practical adoption. Conditional diffusion models show promise for explainability through feature editing, but they typically assume feature independence**--**an assumption violated by intrinsically correlated pathomics features. Consequently, editing one feature while fixing others can push the model off the biological manifold and produce unrealistic artifacts. To address this, we propose a Manifold-Aware Diffusion (MAD) framework for controllable and biologically plausible cell nuclei editing. Unlike existing approaches, our method regularizes feature trajectories within a disentangled latent space learned by a variational auto-encoder (VAE). This ensures that manipulating a target feature automatically adjusts correlated attributes to remain within the learned distribution of real cells. These optimized features then guide a conditional diffusion model to synthesize high-fidelity images. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to navigate the manifold of pathomics features when editing those features. The proposed method outperforms baseline methods in conditional feature editing while preserving structural coherence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GOS: a data-free OOD detection framework using geometry-guided virtual outlier synthesis with vMF distribution and dual-granularity semantic loss, eliminating need for external datasets while outperforming methods that use real external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods under long-tailed distributions rely on external datasets (like 80 Million Tiny Images) which are impractical due to high acquisition costs and privacy concerns. Need a data-free solution that maintains performance.

Method: Geometry-guided virtual Outlier Synthesis (GOS): models statistical properties using von Mises-Fisher distribution on hypersphere, locates low-likelihood annulus in feature space, performs directional sampling of virtual outliers. Dual-Granularity Semantic Loss (DGS): uses contrastive learning to maximize distinction between ID features and synthesized boundary outliers.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmarks like CIFAR-LT show the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches that utilize external real images, demonstrating superior OOD detection performance without external data.

Conclusion: Proposed data-free framework successfully eliminates reliance on external datasets while maintaining superior OOD detection performance through geometry-guided virtual outlier synthesis and dual-granularity semantic learning.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection under long-tailed distributions is a highly challenging task because the scarcity of samples in tail classes leads to blurred decision boundaries in the feature space. Current state-of-the-art (sota) methods typically employ Outlier Exposure (OE) strategies, relying on large-scale real external datasets (such as 80 Million Tiny Images) to regularize the feature space. However, this dependence on external data often becomes infeasible in practical deployment due to high data acquisition costs and privacy sensitivity. To this end, we propose a novel data-free framework aimed at completely eliminating reliance on external datasets while maintaining superior detection performance. We introduce a Geometry-guided virtual Outlier Synthesis (GOS) strategy that models statistical properties using the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a hypersphere. Specifically, we locate a low-likelihood annulus in the feature space and perform directional sampling of virtual outliers in this region. Simultaneously, we introduce a new Dual-Granularity Semantic Loss (DGS) that utilizes contrastive learning to maximize the distinction between in-distribution (ID) features and these synthesized boundary outliers. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms sota approaches that utilize external real images.

TL;DR: InterPrior is a framework that learns unified generative controllers for humanoid loco-manipulation through imitation pretraining and RL finetuning, enabling generalization to unseen objects and interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans plan interactions at high-level affordance level while coordination emerges naturally from physical priors. Scaling such priors is needed for humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Large-scale imitation pretraining distills a full-reference imitation expert into a goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. 2) Reinforcement learning finetuning with data augmentation (physical perturbations) improves competence on unseen goals and initializations, consolidating latent skills into a valid manifold.

Result: Creates a motion prior that generalizes beyond training data, enabling interactions with unseen objects. Demonstrates effectiveness for user-interactive control and potential for real robot deployment.

Conclusion: InterPrior provides a scalable framework for learning unified generative controllers that can generalize humanoid loco-manipulation skills through combined imitation learning and reinforcement learning, addressing the challenge of vast configuration spaces in human-object interactions.

Abstract: Humans rarely plan whole-body interactions with objects at the level of explicit whole-body movements. High-level intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while coordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scaling such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects. We further demonstrate its effectiveness for user-interactive control and its potential for real robot deployment.

*Rui Sun,Yiwen Yang,Kaiyu Guo,Chen Jiang,Dongli Xu,Zhaonan Liu,Tan Pan,Limei Han,Xue Jiang,Wu Wei,Yuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Disco, a new framework for dense cell instance segmentation using adjacency-aware collaborative coloring, addressing limitations of existing methods in complex, overlapping cellular regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cell segmentation methods struggle with complex, dense cellular regions. Graph coloring approaches offer promise but haven't been validated in real-world scenarios with dense overlaps and complex topologies. The authors discovered that most real-world cell graphs are non-bipartite with odd-length cycles, making simple 2-coloring insufficient.

Method: Disco combines "Explicit Marking" (transforming topological challenges into learnable classification via recursive graph decomposition and conflict set isolation) and "Implicit Disambiguation" (resolving ambiguities by enforcing feature dissimilarity between instances to learn separable representations).

Result: The authors released GBC-FS 2025 dataset with complex dense nuclear arrangements and conducted systematic analysis showing real-world cell graphs are non-bipartite with high prevalence of odd-length cycles (triangles).

Conclusion: Disco provides an effective adjacency-aware framework for dense cell instance segmentation by addressing the limitations of simple graph coloring methods through collaborative coloring strategies that handle complex real-world cellular topologies.

Abstract: Accurate cell instance segmentation is foundational for digital pathology analysis. Existing methods based on contour detection and distance mapping still face significant challenges in processing complex and dense cellular regions. Graph coloring-based methods provide a new paradigm for this task, yet the effectiveness of this paradigm in real-world scenarios with dense overlaps and complex topologies has not been verified. Addressing this issue, we release a large-scale dataset GBC-FS 2025, which contains highly complex and dense sub-cellular nuclear arrangements. We conduct the first systematic analysis of the chromatic properties of cell adjacency graphs across four diverse datasets and reveal an important discovery: most real-world cell graphs are non-bipartite, with a high prevalence of odd-length cycles (predominantly triangles). This makes simple 2-coloring theory insufficient for handling complex tissues, while higher-chromaticity models would cause representational redundancy and optimization difficulties. Building on this observation of complex real-world contexts, we propose Disco (Densely-overlapping Cell Instance Segmentation via Adjacency-aware COllaborative Coloring), an adjacency-aware framework based on the "divide and conquer" principle. It uniquely combines a data-driven topological labeling strategy with a constrained deep learning system to resolve complex adjacency conflicts. First, "Explicit Marking" strategy transforms the topological challenge into a learnable classification task by recursively decomposing the cell graph and isolating a "conflict set." Second, "Implicit Disambiguation" mechanism resolves ambiguities in conflict regions by enforcing feature dissimilarity between different instances, enabling the model to learn separable feature representations.

### [47] [NeVStereo: A NeRF-Driven NVS-Stereo Architecture for High-Fidelity 3D Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05423)
*Pengcheng Chen,Yue Hu,Wenhao Li,Nicole M Gunderson,Andrew Feng,Zhenglong Sun,Peter Beerel,Eric J Seibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeVStereo is a unified framework combining NeRF-based novel view synthesis with stereo depth estimation to jointly deliver camera poses, multi-view depth, high-quality rendering, and accurate 3D surface reconstruction from casually captured RGB images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches have limitations: feed-forward 3D reconstruction systems don't explicitly output novel view synthesis, while neural rendering methods assume fixed camera poses and are sensitive to pose errors. There's no single framework that provides accurate poses, reliable depth, high-quality rendering, and accurate 3D surfaces from casually captured views.

Method: NeVStereo combines NeRF-based novel view synthesis for stereo-friendly renderings, confidence-guided multi-view depth estimation, NeRF-coupled bundle adjustment for pose refinement, and an iterative refinement stage that updates both depth and the radiance field to improve geometric consistency.

Result: Achieves consistently strong zero-shot performance across indoor, outdoor, tabletop, and aerial benchmarks: up to 36% lower depth error, 10.4% improved pose accuracy, 4.5% higher NVS fidelity, and state-of-the-art mesh quality (F1 91.93%, Chamfer 4.35 mm) compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: NeVStereo successfully addresses the limitations of existing approaches by providing a unified framework that delivers accurate camera poses, multi-view depth, high-quality novel view synthesis, and accurate 3D surface reconstruction from casually captured RGB-only inputs, while mitigating common NeRF-based issues like surface stacking and artifacts.

Abstract: In modern dense 3D reconstruction, feed-forward systems (e.g., VGGT, pi3) focus on end-to-end matching and geometry prediction but do not explicitly output the novel view synthesis (NVS). Neural rendering-based approaches offer high-fidelity NVS and detailed geometry from posed images, yet they typically assume fixed camera poses and can be sensitive to pose errors. As a result, it remains non-trivial to obtain a single framework that can offer accurate poses, reliable depth, high-quality rendering, and accurate 3D surfaces from casually captured views. We present NeVStereo, a NeRF-driven NVS-stereo architecture that aims to jointly deliver camera poses, multi-view depth, novel view synthesis, and surface reconstruction from multi-view RGB-only inputs. NeVStereo combines NeRF-based NVS for stereo-friendly renderings, confidence-guided multi-view depth estimation, NeRF-coupled bundle adjustment for pose refinement, and an iterative refinement stage that updates both depth and the radiance field to improve geometric consistency. This design mitigated the common NeRF-based issues such as surface stacking, artifacts, and pose-depth coupling. Across indoor, outdoor, tabletop, and aerial benchmarks, our experiments indicate that NeVStereo achieves consistently strong zero-shot performance, with up to 36% lower depth error, 10.4% improved pose accuracy, 4.5% higher NVS fidelity, and state-of-the-art mesh quality (F1 91.93%, Chamfer 4.35 mm) compared to existing prestigious methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-AD is a CNN-based unsupervised anomaly detection model using SE blocks for attention, knowledge distillation for feature transfer, and discriminator networks for enhanced anomaly discrimination, achieving state-of-the-art performance across medical and industrial domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of annotated data in cross-domain anomaly detection applications, particularly in critical areas like medical disease diagnosis and industrial defect detection where labeled anomalous data is scarce.

Method: Proposes Multi-AD with: 1) SE blocks for channel-wise attention to focus on relevant features, 2) Knowledge distillation to transfer informative features from teacher to student model, 3) Discriminator network to enhance anomaly discrimination, 4) Multi-scale feature integration for detecting varying anomaly sizes, and 5) Teacher-student architecture for consistent high-dimensional feature representation.

Result: Achieved best average AUROC scores: image-level (81.4% medical, 99.6% industrial) and pixel-level (97.0% medical, 98.4% industrial), outperforming state-of-the-art models across brain MRI, liver CT, retina OCT, and MVTec AD datasets.

Conclusion: Multi-AD demonstrates strong generalization across multiple domains with robust unsupervised anomaly detection capabilities, making it effective for real-world applications in both medical and industrial settings.

Abstract: Traditional deep learning models often lack annotated data, especially in cross-domain applications such as anomaly detection, which is critical for early disease diagnosis in medicine and defect detection in industry. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-AD, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for robust unsupervised anomaly detection across medical and industrial images. Our approach employs the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to enhance feature extraction via channel-wise attention, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant features and detect subtle anomalies. Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers informative features from the teacher to the student model, enabling effective learning of the differences between normal and anomalous data. Then, the discriminator network further enhances the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous data. At the inference stage, by integrating multi-scale features, the student model can detect anomalies of varying sizes. The teacher-student (T-S) architecture ensures consistent representation of high-dimensional features while adapting them to enhance anomaly detection. Multi-AD was evaluated on several medical datasets, including brain MRI, liver CT, and retina OCT, as well as industrial datasets, such as MVTec AD, demonstrating strong generalization across multiple domains. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach consistently outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving the best average AUROC for both image-level (81.4% for medical and 99.6% for industrial) and pixel-level (97.0% for medical and 98.4% for industrial) tasks, making it effective for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LD-SLRO uses latent diffusion models to restore distorted fringe patterns on reflective surfaces, improving 3D reconstruction accuracy by suppressing specular artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D reconstruction of glossy surfaces using fringe projection profilometry is challenging due to specular reflection and indirect illumination that distort or lose fringe patterns, requiring a solution to handle highly reflective objects.

Method: Proposes LD-SLRO: encodes phase-shifted fringe images from reflective surfaces into latent representations, uses these as conditional inputs to a latent diffusion model to probabilistically suppress reflection artifacts and recover lost fringe information, with specialized components including specular reflection encoder, time-variant channel affine layer, and attention modules.

Result: Method improves both fringe quality and 3D reconstruction accuracy, reducing average root-mean-squared error from 1.8176 mm to 0.9619 mm compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LD-SLRO effectively addresses the challenge of 3D reconstruction for highly reflective surfaces by using latent diffusion models to restore fringe patterns, offering high flexibility in input/output configuration and superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Fringe projection profilometry-based 3-D reconstruction of objects with high reflectivity and low surface roughness remains a significant challenge. When measuring such glossy surfaces, specular reflection and indirect illumination often lead to severe distortion or loss of the projected fringe patterns. To address these issues, we propose a latent diffusion-based structured light for reflective objects (LD-SLRO). Phase-shifted fringe images captured from highly reflective surfaces are first encoded to extract latent representations that capture surface reflectance characteristics. These latent features are then used as conditional inputs to a latent diffusion model, which probabilistically suppresses reflection-induced artifacts and recover lost fringe information, yielding high-quality fringe images. The proposed components, including the specular reflection encoder, time-variant channel affine layer, and attention modules, further improve fringe restoration quality. In addition, LD-SLRO provides high flexibility in configuring the input and output fringe sets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves both fringe quality and 3-D reconstruction accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, reducing the average root-mean-squared error from 1.8176 mm to 0.9619 mm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stable Velocity framework reduces variance in flow matching training and accelerates sampling by exploiting low-variance regime near data distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow matching's reliance on single-sample conditional velocities creates high-variance training targets that destabilize optimization and slow convergence, particularly near the prior distribution.

Method: Proposes Stable Velocity framework with: 1) Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM) for unbiased variance reduction in training, 2) Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA) for adaptive supervision in low-variance regime, and 3) Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS) for finetuning-free acceleration using closed-form simplifications in low-variance regime.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256×256 and large pretrained models (SD3.5, Flux, Qwen-Image, Wan2.2) show consistent training efficiency improvements and >2× faster sampling without quality degradation.

Conclusion: The Stable Velocity framework successfully addresses flow matching's variance issues, improving both training stability and sampling efficiency by exploiting the low-variance regime near data distribution.

Abstract: While flow matching is elegant, its reliance on single-sample conditional velocities leads to high-variance training targets that destabilize optimization and slow convergence. By explicitly characterizing this variance, we identify 1) a high-variance regime near the prior, where optimization is challenging, and 2) a low-variance regime near the data distribution, where conditional and marginal velocities nearly coincide. Leveraging this insight, we propose Stable Velocity, a unified framework that improves both training and sampling. For training, we introduce Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM), an unbiased variance-reduction objective, along with Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA), which adaptively strengthen auxiliary supervision in the low-variance regime. For inference, we show that dynamics in the low-variance regime admit closed-form simplifications, enabling Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS), a finetuning-free acceleration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet $256\times256$ and large pretrained text-to-image and text-to-video models, including SD3.5, Flux, Qwen-Image, and Wan2.2, demonstrate consistent improvements in training efficiency and more than $2\times$ faster sampling within the low-variance regime without degrading sample quality.

TL;DR: Parametric 3D defect modeling for synthetic data generation in non-destructive testing, enabling automated defect detection with machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for automated defect detection in industry quality control, requiring large amounts of training data that can be generated synthetically using digital twins and rule-based approaches.

Method: Develop parametric methods to model 3D mesh objects of various defect types, add them to object geometry to create synthetic defective objects, then use physically-based Monte Carlo simulation to generate synthetic inspection data with pixel-perfect annotations.

Result: Variable and arbitrarily large synthetic datasets can be generated, including rarely occurring defects in sufficient quantity, with parallel creation of pixel-perfect annotations for training machine learning models.

Conclusion: The approach enables scalable synthetic data generation for automated defect detection across various NDT methods, demonstrated with visual surface inspection but applicable to other testing methods through simulation.

Abstract: In industry, defect detection is crucial for quality control. Non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are preferred as they do not influence the functionality of the object while inspecting. Automated data evaluation for automated defect detection is a growing field of research. In particular, machine learning approaches show promising results. To provide training data in sufficient amount and quality, synthetic data can be used. Rule-based approaches enable synthetic data generation in a controllable environment. Therefore, a digital twin of the inspected object including synthetic defects is needed. We present parametric methods to model 3d mesh objects of various defect types that can then be added to the object geometry to obtain synthetic defective objects. The models are motivated by common defects in metal casting but can be transferred to other machining procedures that produce similar defect shapes. Synthetic data resembling the real inspection data can then be created by using a physically based Monte Carlo simulation of the respective testing method. Using our defect models, a variable and arbitrarily large synthetic data set can be generated with the possibility to include rarely occurring defects in sufficient quantity. Pixel-perfect annotation can be created in parallel. As an example, we will use visual surface inspection, but the procedure can be applied in combination with simulations for any other NDT method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel distillation-compatible learnable feature caching mechanism for video diffusion models that achieves 11.8× acceleration while preserving generation quality, addressing limitations of existing training-free caching and step-distillation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion model acceleration methods have significant limitations: training-free feature caching suffers from semantic/detail loss with compression, while step-distillation degrades severely in video generation with few steps. Combining these methods worsens quality due to sparser sampling steps.

Method: 1) Introduces a learnable neural predictor instead of training-free heuristics for feature caching, enabling accurate capture of high-dimensional feature evolution. 2) Proposes a conservative Restricted MeanFlow approach for stable, lossless distillation on large-scale video models.

Result: Achieves 11.8× acceleration while preserving generation quality, demonstrating effectiveness through extensive experiments. The method overcomes limitations of existing approaches and pushes acceleration boundaries.

Conclusion: The proposed distillation-compatible learnable feature caching mechanism successfully addresses the computational burden of video diffusion models, achieving significant acceleration without quality degradation through neural predictors and stable distillation techniques.

Abstract: While diffusion models have achieved great success in the field of video generation, this progress is accompanied by a rapidly escalating computational burden. Among the existing acceleration methods, Feature Caching is popular due to its training-free property and considerable speedup performance, but it inevitably faces semantic and detail drop with further compression. Another widely adopted method, training-aware step-distillation, though successful in image generation, also faces drastic degradation in video generation with a few steps. Furthermore, the quality loss becomes more severe when simply applying training-free feature caching to the step-distilled models, due to the sparser sampling steps. This paper novelly introduces a distillation-compatible learnable feature caching mechanism for the first time. We employ a lightweight learnable neural predictor instead of traditional training-free heuristics for diffusion models, enabling a more accurate capture of the high-dimensional feature evolution process. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of highly compressed distillation on large-scale video models and propose a conservative Restricted MeanFlow approach to achieve more stable and lossless distillation. By undertaking these initiatives, we further push the acceleration boundaries to $11.8\times$ while preserving generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is in the supplementary materials and will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel attention-retaining framework for continual learning that mitigates catastrophic forgetting in Vision Transformers by constraining attention drift through gradient masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning, and the paper identifies attention drift in Vision Transformers as a primary source of this problem, where attention to previously learned visual concepts shifts significantly after learning new tasks.

Method: A two-step gradient masking process: 1) extract attention maps of previous tasks using layer-wise rollout and generate instance-adaptive binary masks, 2) when learning new tasks, apply these masks to zero out gradients associated with previous attention regions to prevent disruption of learned concepts. Enhanced with scaling parameter updates for compatibility with modern optimizers.

Result: The method effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and preserves visual concepts, achieving state-of-the-art performance and exhibiting robust generalizability across diverse continual learning scenarios.

Conclusion: The attention-retaining framework successfully addresses catastrophic forgetting in Vision Transformers by preventing attention drift, demonstrating the importance of preserving attention patterns in continual learning systems.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers AI systems to progressively acquire knowledge from non-stationary data streams. However, catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge. In this work, we identify attention drift in Vision Transformers as a primary source of catastrophic forgetting, where the attention to previously learned visual concepts shifts significantly after learning new tasks. Inspired by neuroscientific insights into the selective attention in the human visual system, we propose a novel attention-retaining framework to mitigate forgetting in CL. Our method constrains attention drift by explicitly modifying gradients during backpropagation through a two-step process: 1) extracting attention maps of the previous task using a layer-wise rollout mechanism and generating instance-adaptive binary masks, and 2) when learning a new task, applying these masks to zero out gradients associated with previous attention regions, thereby preventing disruption of learned visual concepts. For compatibility with modern optimizers, the gradient masking process is further enhanced by scaling parameter updates proportionally to maintain their relative magnitudes. Experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserving visual concepts. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits robust generalizability across diverse CL scenarios.

*Peihao Wu,Yongxiang Yao,Yi Wan,Wenfei Zhang,Ruipeng Zhao,Jiayuan Li,Yongjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOMA-1M is a large-scale, pixel-level aligned SAR-optical dataset with 1.3M image pairs across 12 land cover categories and multi-scale resolutions (0.5m-10m), designed to support multimodal remote sensing foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmark datasets have limitations: single spatial resolution, insufficient scale, and low alignment accuracy, making them inadequate for training and generalizing multi-scale foundation models that need to leverage complementary SAR and optical imagery.

Method: Created SOMA-1M dataset with over 1.3M georeferenced image pairs (512x512 pixels) from Sentinel-1, PIESAT-1, Capella Space, and Google Earth. Used a rigorous coarse-to-fine image matching framework to ensure pixel-level alignment despite multimodal projection deformation and massive data registration challenges.

Result: Dataset achieves global multi-scale coverage (0.5m-10m) with 12 land cover categories. Established evaluation benchmarks for four vision tasks (matching, fusion, SAR-assisted cloud removal, translation) with 30+ algorithms. Supervised training on SOMA-1M significantly enhances performance across all tasks, achieving SOTA in multimodal remote sensing image matching.

Conclusion: SOMA-1M serves as a foundational resource for robust multimodal algorithms and remote sensing foundation models, addressing critical gaps in existing datasets and enabling cross-modal collaborative processing and intelligent interpretation.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery provide complementary strengths that constitute the critical foundation for transcending single-modality constraints and facilitating cross-modal collaborative processing and intelligent interpretation. However, existing benchmark datasets often suffer from limitations such as single spatial resolution, insufficient data scale, and low alignment accuracy, making them inadequate for supporting the training and generalization of multi-scale foundation models. To address these challenges, we introduce SOMA-1M (SAR-Optical Multi-resolution Alignment), a pixel-level precisely aligned dataset containing over 1.3 million pairs of georeferenced images with a specification of 512 x 512 pixels. This dataset integrates imagery from Sentinel-1, PIESAT-1, Capella Space, and Google Earth, achieving global multi-scale coverage from 0.5 m to 10 m. It encompasses 12 typical land cover categories, effectively ensuring scene diversity and complexity. To address multimodal projection deformation and massive data registration, we designed a rigorous coarse-to-fine image matching framework ensuring pixel-level alignment. Based on this dataset, we established comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for four hierarchical vision tasks, including image matching, image fusion, SAR-assisted cloud removal, and cross-modal translation, involving over 30 mainstream algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that supervised training on SOMA-1M significantly enhances performance across all tasks. Notably, multimodal remote sensing image (MRSI) matching performance achieves current state-of-the-art (SOTA) levels. SOMA-1M serves as a foundational resource for robust multimodal algorithms and remote sensing foundation models. The dataset will be released publicly at: https://github.com/PeihaoWu/SOMA-1M.

*Julien Moreau,S. Ambellouis,Yassine Ruichek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 2014 PhD research report introducing PFSeq dataset for evaluating feature detectors/descriptors on fisheye images for self-calibration in urban visual odometry applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the chicken-and-egg problem in fisheye camera self-calibration: need accurate projection models for optimal feature detection, but need good features to compute those models. The research aims to find the best feature detector/descriptor combinations for fisheye images in urban scene applications.

Method: Created PFSeq (Photorealistic Fisheye Sequence) dataset available publicly. Conducted comprehensive experiments comparing standard feature detection and description algorithms on fisheye imagery from cameras mounted on car roofs aiming at zenith. Focused on self-calibration context for visual odometry and stereovision.

Result: Provides a detailed dataset and experimental analysis (though not peer-reviewed and represents 2014 state-of-the-art). The report serves as a resource for fisheye image processing research with practical urban scene applications.

Conclusion: This draft report contributes a valuable fisheye image dataset (PFSeq) and experimental framework for evaluating feature detection/description methods in fisheye self-calibration contexts, though limited by its 2014 perspective and lack of peer review.

Abstract: What is this report: This is a scientific report, contributing with a detailed bibliography, a dataset which we will call now PFSeq for ''Photorealistic Fisheye Sequence'' and make available at https://doi.org/10. 57745/DYIVVU, and comprehensive experiments. This work should be considered as a draft, and has been done during my PhD thesis ''Construction of 3D models from fisheye video data-Application to the localisation in urban area'' in 2014 [Mor16]. These results have never been published. The aim was to find the best features detector and descriptor for fisheye images, in the context of selfcalibration, with cameras mounted on the top of a car and aiming at the zenith (to proceed then fisheye visual odometry and stereovision in urban scenes). We face a chicken and egg problem, because we can not take advantage of an accurate projection model for an optimal features detection and description, and we rightly need good features to perform the calibration (i.e. to compute the accurate projection model of the camera). What is not this report: It does not contribute with new features algorithm. It does not compare standard features algorithms to algorithms designed for omnidirectional images (unfortunately). It has not been peer-reviewed. Discussions have been translated and enhanced but the experiments have not been run again and the report has not been updated accordingly to the evolution of the state-of-the-art (read this as a 2014 report).

*Zhuang Xiong,Chen Zhang,Qingshan Xu,Wenbing Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGGT-Motion is a calibration-free monocular SLAM system that addresses scale drift in long sequences through motion-aware submap construction and efficient global optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing calibration-free monocular SLAM systems suffer from severe scale drift on long sequences due to motion-agnostic partitioning that breaks contextual coherence and causes zero-motion drift, while conventional geometric alignment methods are computationally expensive.

Method: 1) Motion-aware submap construction using optical flow for adaptive partitioning, static redundancy pruning, and turn encapsulation; 2) Anchor-driven direct Sim(3) registration with context-balanced anchors for search-free, pixel-wise dense alignment; 3) Lightweight submap-level pose graph optimization with linear complexity for global consistency.

Result: VGGT-Motion achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, long-range calibration-free monocular SLAM, markedly improving trajectory accuracy and efficiency on kilometer-scale trajectories.

Conclusion: The proposed VGGT-Motion system effectively addresses scale drift in long sequences through motion-aware partitioning and efficient global optimization, enabling robust and scalable calibration-free monocular SLAM over kilometer-scale trajectories.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in calibration-free monocular SLAM via 3D vision foundation models, scale drift remains severe on long sequences. Motion-agnostic partitioning breaks contextual coherence and causes zero-motion drift, while conventional geometric alignment is computationally expensive. To address these issues, we propose VGGT-Motion, a calibration-free SLAM system for efficient and robust global consistency over kilometer-scale trajectories. Specifically, we first propose a motion-aware submap construction mechanism that uses optical flow to guide adaptive partitioning, prune static redundancy, and encapsulate turns for stable local geometry. We then design an anchor-driven direct Sim(3) registration strategy. By exploiting context-balanced anchors, it achieves search-free, pixel-wise dense alignment and efficient loop closure without costly feature matching. Finally, a lightweight submap-level pose graph optimization enforces global consistency with linear complexity, enabling scalable long-range operation. Experiments show that VGGT-Motion markedly improves trajectory accuracy and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, long-range calibration-free monocular SLAM.

*Jeongbin You,Donggun Kim,Sejun Park,Seungsang Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mapper-GIN: A lightweight 3D point cloud classification method using topological decomposition via Mapper algorithm and Graph Isomorphism Network for robust recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether structural abstraction alone (without scaling up backbones or specialized data augmentation) can improve robustness in 3D point cloud classification, focusing on topology-inspired decomposition.

Method: Mapper-GIN pipeline: 1) Partition point cloud into overlapping regions using Mapper algorithm (PCA lens, cubical cover, density-based clustering), 2) Construct region graph from overlaps, 3) Perform graph classification with Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN).

Result: Achieves competitive and stable accuracy on ModelNet40-C corruption benchmark under Noise and Transformation corruptions with only 0.5M parameters, outperforming heavier architectures requiring additional robustness mechanisms.

Conclusion: Region-graph structure provides efficient and interpretable source of robustness for 3D visual recognition, demonstrating that structural abstraction alone can significantly improve corruption robustness.

Abstract: Robust 3D point cloud classification is often pursued by scaling up backbones or relying on specialized data augmentation. We instead ask whether structural abstraction alone can improve robustness, and study a simple topology-inspired decomposition based on the Mapper algorithm. We propose Mapper-GIN, a lightweight pipeline that partitions a point cloud into overlapping regions using Mapper (PCA lens, cubical cover, and followed by density-based clustering), constructs a region graph from their overlaps, and performs graph classification with a Graph Isomorphism Network. On the corruption benchmark ModelNet40-C, Mapper-GIN achieves competitive and stable accuracy under Noise and Transformation corruptions with only 0.5M parameters. In contrast to prior approaches that require heavier architectures or additional mechanisms to gain robustness, Mapper-GIN attains strong corruption robustness through simple region-level graph abstraction and GIN message passing. Overall, our results suggest that region-graph structure offers an efficient and interpretable source of robustness for 3D visual recognition.

### [58] [Generalization of Self-Supervised Vision Transformers for Protein Localization Across Microscopy Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05527)
*Ben Isselmann,Dilara Göksu,Andreas Weinmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINO-pretrained Vision Transformers show strong cross-domain transferability for protein localization in microscopy, with domain-relevant pretraining (Human Protein Atlas) outperforming both ImageNet and task-specific pretraining on OpenCell.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microscopy datasets are often too small for robust deep learning. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can help via pretraining on large unlabeled datasets, but it's unclear how well SSL representations transfer across different microscopy domains with varying staining protocols and channel configurations.

Method: Investigated cross-domain transferability of DINO-pretrained Vision Transformers for protein localization on OpenCell dataset. Generated image embeddings using three DINO backbones pretrained on: 1) ImageNet-1k, 2) Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and 3) OpenCell. Evaluated by training supervised classification head on OpenCell labels.

Result: All pretrained models transferred well. HPA-pretrained model achieved best performance (mean macro F1-score = 0.8221 ± 0.0062), slightly outperforming DINO model trained directly on OpenCell (0.8057 ± 0.0090). ImageNet-pretrained model also performed well but was slightly behind domain-specific models.

Conclusion: Large-scale pretraining is valuable for microscopy tasks. Domain-relevant SSL representations can generalize effectively to related but distinct microscopy datasets, enabling strong downstream performance even with limited task-specific labeled data. Microscopy-specific pretraining (HPA) provides the best transferability.

Abstract: Task-specific microscopy datasets are often too small to train deep learning models that learn robust feature representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can mitigate this by pretraining on large unlabeled datasets, but it remains unclear how well such representations transfer across microscopy domains with different staining protocols and channel configurations. We investigate the cross-domain transferability of DINO-pretrained Vision Transformers for protein localization on the OpenCell dataset. We generate image embeddings using three DINO backbones pretrained on ImageNet-1k, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and OpenCell, and evaluate them by training a supervised classification head on OpenCell labels. All pretrained models transfer well, with the microscopy-specific HPA-pretrained model achieving the best performance (mean macro $F_1$-score = 0.8221 \pm 0.0062), slightly outperforming a DINO model trained directly on OpenCell (0.8057 \pm 0.0090). These results highlight the value of large-scale pretraining and indicate that domain-relevant SSL representations can generalize effectively to related but distinct microscopy datasets, enabling strong downstream performance even when task-specific labeled data are limited.

### [59] [SSG: Scaled Spatial Guidance for Multi-Scale Visual Autoregressive Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05534)
*Youngwoo Shin,Jiwan Hur,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSG is a training-free inference-time guidance method that improves VAR models by ensuring proper coarse-to-fine hierarchy through frequency-aware semantic residual guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models can drift from their intended coarse-to-fine hierarchy during inference due to limited capacity and accumulated errors, causing train-inference discrepancy.

Method: Proposes Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG) that emphasizes target high-frequency signals (semantic residual) isolated from coarser prior using Discrete Spatial Enhancement (DSE) for frequency-aware construction.

Result: SSG yields consistent gains in fidelity and diversity while preserving low latency across various VAR models with discrete visual tokens.

Conclusion: SSG reveals untapped efficiency in coarse-to-fine image generation by mitigating train-inference discrepancy through principled frequency-domain guidance.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (VAR) models generate images through next-scale prediction, naturally achieving coarse-to-fine, fast, high-fidelity synthesis mirroring human perception. In practice, this hierarchy can drift at inference time, as limited capacity and accumulated error cause the model to deviate from its coarse-to-fine nature. We revisit this limitation from an information-theoretic perspective and deduce that ensuring each scale contributes high-frequency content not explained by earlier scales mitigates the train-inference discrepancy. With this insight, we propose Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG), training-free, inference-time guidance that steers generation toward the intended hierarchy while maintaining global coherence. SSG emphasizes target high-frequency signals, defined as the semantic residual, isolated from a coarser prior. To obtain this prior, we leverage a principled frequency-domain procedure, Discrete Spatial Enhancement (DSE), which is devised to sharpen and better isolate the semantic residual through frequency-aware construction. SSG applies broadly across VAR models leveraging discrete visual tokens, regardless of tokenization design or conditioning modality. Experiments demonstrate SSG yields consistent gains in fidelity and diversity while preserving low latency, revealing untapped efficiency in coarse-to-fine image generation.

*Malaz Tamim,Andrea Matic-Flierl,Karsten Roscher*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of 3D person detection comparing camera-only, LiDAR-only, and camera-LiDAR fusion approaches on JRDB dataset, showing fusion outperforms single modalities but remains vulnerable to sensor issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D person detection is critical for safety in robotics, industrial monitoring, and surveillance, but most existing research focuses on autonomous driving rather than diverse indoor/outdoor scenes.

Method: Evaluated three representative models: BEVDepth (camera-only), PointPillars (LiDAR-only), and DAL (camera-LiDAR fusion) on JRDB dataset. Analyzed performance under varying occlusion, distance levels, and robustness against sensor corruptions and misalignments.

Result: Fusion-based approach consistently outperforms single-modality models, especially in challenging scenarios. DAL offers improved resilience but remains sensitive to sensor misalignment and certain LiDAR corruptions. Camera-based BEVDepth showed lowest performance and was most affected by occlusion, distance, and noise.

Conclusion: Sensor fusion is important for enhanced 3D person detection, but ongoing research is needed to address vulnerabilities in these systems, particularly regarding sensor misalignment and corruption robustness.

Abstract: Accurate 3D person detection is critical for safety in applications such as robotics, industrial monitoring, and surveillance. This work presents a systematic evaluation of 3D person detection using camera-only, LiDAR-only, and camera-LiDAR fusion. While most existing research focuses on autonomous driving, we explore detection performance and robustness in diverse indoor and outdoor scenes using the JRDB dataset. We compare three representative models - BEVDepth (camera), PointPillars (LiDAR), and DAL (camera-LiDAR fusion) - and analyze their behavior under varying occlusion and distance levels. Our results show that the fusion-based approach consistently outperforms single-modality models, particularly in challenging scenarios. We further investigate robustness against sensor corruptions and misalignments, revealing that while DAL offers improved resilience, it remains sensitive to sensor misalignment and certain LiDAR-based corruptions. In contrast, the camera-based BEVDepth model showed the lowest performance and was most affected by occlusion, distance, and noise. Our findings highlight the importance of utilizing sensor fusion for enhanced 3D person detection, while also underscoring the need for ongoing research to address the vulnerabilities inherent in these systems.

### [61] [FastVMT: Eliminating Redundancy in Video Motion Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05551)
*Yue Ma,Zhikai Wang,Tianhao Ren,Mingzhe Zheng,Hongyu Liu,Jiayi Guo,Mark Fong,Yuxuan Xue,Zixiang Zhao,Konrad Schindler,Qifeng Chen,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastVMT accelerates video motion transfer by reducing computational redundancy in Diffusion Transformers through local attention masking and gradient reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video motion transfer methods using Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have structural inefficiencies that limit runtime performance. Existing acceleration attempts fail to address fundamental computational redundancies in the architecture.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) Local attention masking to address motion redundancy by restricting attention to neighboring regions since frame-to-frame motion is small and smooth, and 2) Gradient reuse optimization that exploits slow-changing gradients along the diffusion trajectory to skip unnecessary computations.

Result: FastVMT achieves an average 3.43x speedup compared to previous methods while maintaining visual fidelity and temporal consistency in generated videos.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that addressing structural inefficiencies in DiT architectures through motion-aware local attention and gradient optimization can significantly accelerate video motion transfer without compromising quality.

Abstract: Video motion transfer aims to synthesize videos by generating visual content according to a text prompt while transferring the motion pattern observed in a reference video. Recent methods predominantly use the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. To achieve satisfactory runtime, several methods attempt to accelerate the computations in the DiT, but fail to address structural sources of inefficiency. In this work, we identify and remove two types of computational redundancy in earlier work: motion redundancy arises because the generic DiT architecture does not reflect the fact that frame-to-frame motion is small and smooth; gradient redundancy occurs if one ignores that gradients change slowly along the diffusion trajectory. To mitigate motion redundancy, we mask the corresponding attention layers to a local neighborhood such that interaction weights are not computed unnecessarily distant image regions. To exploit gradient redundancy, we design an optimization scheme that reuses gradients from previous diffusion steps and skips unwarranted gradient computations. On average, FastVMT achieves a 3.43x speedup without degrading the visual fidelity or the temporal consistency of the generated videos.

### [62] [ShapeGaussian: High-Fidelity 4D Human Reconstruction in Monocular Videos via Vision Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05572)
*Zhenxiao Liang,Ning Zhang,Youbao Tang,Ruei-Sung Lin,Qixing Huang,Peng Chang,Jing Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShapeGaussian is a template-free method for high-fidelity 4D human reconstruction from monocular videos that combines vision priors to overcome limitations of both template-based and generic reconstruction approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations: generic reconstruction methods (like 4DGS) struggle with high-deformation human motion without multi-view cues, while template-based approaches (like HUGS using SMPL) are susceptible to pose estimation errors leading to unrealistic artifacts. There's a need for a method that achieves both high-fidelity and robustness in 4D human reconstruction from casual monocular videos.

Method: Two-step pipeline: 1) Learn coarse deformable geometry using pretrained models that estimate data-driven priors, 2) Refine geometry using a neural deformation model to capture fine-grained dynamic details. The method leverages 2D vision priors to mitigate pose estimation artifacts and employs multiple reference frames to resolve 2D keypoint invisibility issues in a template-free manner.

Result: Extensive experiments show ShapeGaussian surpasses template-based methods in reconstruction accuracy, achieving superior visual quality and robustness across diverse human motions in casual monocular videos.

Conclusion: ShapeGaussian effectively integrates template-free vision priors to achieve both high-fidelity and robust 4D human scene reconstructions from casual monocular videos, overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: We introduce ShapeGaussian, a high-fidelity, template-free method for 4D human reconstruction from casual monocular videos. Generic reconstruction methods lacking robust vision priors, such as 4DGS, struggle to capture high-deformation human motion without multi-view cues. While template-based approaches, primarily relying on SMPL, such as HUGS, can produce photorealistic results, they are highly susceptible to errors in human pose estimation, often leading to unrealistic artifacts. In contrast, ShapeGaussian effectively integrates template-free vision priors to achieve both high-fidelity and robust scene reconstructions. Our method follows a two-step pipeline: first, we learn a coarse, deformable geometry using pretrained models that estimate data-driven priors, providing a foundation for reconstruction. Then, we refine this geometry using a neural deformation model to capture fine-grained dynamic details. By leveraging 2D vision priors, we mitigate artifacts from erroneous pose estimation in template-based methods and employ multiple reference frames to resolve the invisibility issue of 2D keypoints in a template-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShapeGaussian surpasses template-based methods in reconstruction accuracy, achieving superior visual quality and robustness across diverse human motions in casual monocular videos.

TL;DR: ViGT is a calibration-free 3D occupancy field estimation model for autonomous driving that uses self-supervised learning from image-LiDAR pairs and achieves SOTA performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a foundational geometric model for autonomous driving that prioritizes scalability, architectural simplicity, and generalization across diverse sensor configurations without requiring manual annotations.

Method: Uses a calibration-free architecture with Visual Implicit Geometry Transformer to estimate continuous 3D occupancy fields from surround-view cameras. Employs self-supervised training using synchronized image-LiDAR pairs instead of manual annotations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on pointmap estimation task with best average rank across all baselines. On Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, achieves comparable performance with supervised methods. Trained on mixture of five large-scale datasets.

Conclusion: ViGT represents a step toward foundational geometric models for autonomous driving, offering calibration-free operation, self-supervised learning, and strong generalization across different sensor setups and datasets.

Abstract: We introduce the Visual Implicit Geometry Transformer (ViGT), an autonomous driving geometric model that estimates continuous 3D occupancy fields from surround-view camera rigs. ViGT represents a step towards foundational geometric models for autonomous driving, prioritizing scalability, architectural simplicity, and generalization across diverse sensor configurations. Our approach achieves this through a calibration-free architecture, enabling a single model to adapt to different sensor setups. Unlike general-purpose geometric foundational models that focus on pixel-aligned predictions, ViGT estimates a continuous 3D occupancy field in a birds-eye-view (BEV) addressing domain-specific requirements. ViGT naturally infers geometry from multiple camera views into a single metric coordinate frame, providing a common representation for multiple geometric tasks. Unlike most existing occupancy models, we adopt a self-supervised training procedure that leverages synchronized image-LiDAR pairs, eliminating the need for costly manual annotations. We validate the scalability and generalizability of our approach by training our model on a mixture of five large-scale autonomous driving datasets (NuScenes, Waymo, NuPlan, ONCE, and Argoverse) and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the pointmap estimation task, with the best average rank across all evaluated baselines. We further evaluate ViGT on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, where ViGT achieves comparable performance with supervised methods.

TL;DR: Hybrid CNN-ML framework using multi-modal MRI data achieves high AUC scores (0.95, 0.86, 0.92) for differentiating atypical Parkinsonian disorders from Parkinson's disease and between subtypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atypical Parkinsonian Disorders (APD) like PSP and MSA are often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease in early stages due to overlapping symptoms. There's a critical need for reliable imaging biomarkers for early differential diagnosis.

Method: Proposed hybrid framework combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with machine learning techniques. Uses multi-modal input: T1-weighted MRI, segmentation masks of 12 deep brain structures, and corresponding volumetric measurements. Integrates image data, structural segmentation masks, and quantitative volume features.

Result: Achieved promising classification performance with AUC scores: 0.95 for PSP vs. PD, 0.86 for MSA vs. PD, and 0.92 for PSP vs. MSA. Demonstrates effectiveness of combining spatial and structural information for subtype differentiation.

Conclusion: Fusing CNN-based image features with volume-based ML inputs improves classification accuracy for APD subtypes. The approach may contribute to more reliable early-stage diagnosis, facilitating timely and targeted interventions in clinical practice.

Abstract: Atypical Parkinsonian Disorders (APD), also known as Parkinson-plus syndrome, are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). In the early stages, overlapping clinical features often lead to misdiagnosis as Parkinson's disease (PD). Identifying reliable imaging biomarkers for early differential diagnosis remains a critical challenge. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with machine learning (ML) techniques to classify APD subtypes versus PD and distinguish between the subtypes themselves: PSP vs. PD, MSA vs. PD, and PSP vs. MSA. The model leverages multi-modal input data, including T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), segmentation masks of 12 deep brain structures associated with APD, and their corresponding volumetric measurements. By integrating these complementary modalities, including image data, structural segmentation masks, and quantitative volume features, the hybrid approach achieved promising classification performance with area under the curve (AUC) scores of 0.95 for PSP vs. PD, 0.86 for MSA vs. PD, and 0.92 for PSP vs. MSA. These results highlight the potential of combining spatial and structural information for robust subtype differentiation. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that fusing CNN-based image features with volume-based ML inputs improves classification accuracy for APD subtypes. The proposed approach may contribute to more reliable early-stage diagnosis, facilitating timely and targeted interventions in clinical practice.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image editing have enabled highly controllable and semantically-aware alteration of visual content, posing unprecedented challenges to manipulation localization. However, existing AI-generated forgery localization methods primarily focus on inpainting-based manipulations, making them ineffective against the latest instruction-based editing paradigms. To bridge this critical gap, we propose LocateEdit-Bench, a large-scale dataset comprising $231$K edited images, designed specifically to benchmark localization methods against instruction-driven image editing. Our dataset incorporates four cutting-edge editing models and covers three common edit types. We conduct a detailed analysis of the dataset and develop two multi-metric evaluation protocols to assess existing localization methods. Our work establishes a foundation to keep pace with the evolving landscape of image editing, thereby facilitating the development of effective methods for future forgery localization.

### [66] [LoGoSeg: Integrating Local and Global Features for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05578)
*Junyang Chen,Xiangbo Lv,Zhiqiang Kou,Xingdong Sheng,Ning Xu,Yiguo Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoGoSeg is an efficient single-stage framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation that integrates object existence priors, region-aware alignment, and dual-stream fusion to improve spatial alignment and reduce hallucinations without needing external proposals or extra datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-vocabulary segmentation methods using vision-language models suffer from imprecise spatial alignment due to image-level pretraining, leading to mismatched segmentations in ambiguous scenes. They also lack strong object priors and region-level constraints, causing object hallucination and missed detections.

Method: LoGoSeg introduces three key innovations: (1) object existence prior that dynamically weights relevant categories using global image-text similarity to reduce hallucinations, (2) region-aware alignment module for precise region-level visual-textual correspondences, and (3) dual-stream fusion mechanism combining local structural information with global semantic context. It's a single-stage framework requiring no external mask proposals, additional backbones, or extra datasets.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmarks (A-847, PC-459, A-150, PC-59, PAS-20, and PAS-20b) demonstrate competitive performance and strong generalization in open-vocabulary settings.

Conclusion: LoGoSeg effectively addresses spatial misalignment and hallucination issues in open-vocabulary segmentation through integrated object priors and region-level alignment, achieving efficient and accurate segmentation without requiring additional resources.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) extends traditional closed-set segmentation by enabling pixel-wise annotation for both seen and unseen categories using arbitrary textual descriptions. While existing methods leverage vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, their reliance on image-level pretraining often results in imprecise spatial alignment, leading to mismatched segmentations in ambiguous or cluttered scenes. However, most existing approaches lack strong object priors and region-level constraints, which can lead to object hallucination or missed detections, further degrading performance. To address these challenges, we propose LoGoSeg, an efficient single-stage framework that integrates three key innovations: (i) an object existence prior that dynamically weights relevant categories through global image-text similarity, effectively reducing hallucinations; (ii) a region-aware alignment module that establishes precise region-level visual-textual correspondences; and (iii) a dual-stream fusion mechanism that optimally combines local structural information with global semantic context. Unlike prior works, LoGoSeg eliminates the need for external mask proposals, additional backbones, or extra datasets, ensuring efficiency. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks (A-847, PC-459, A-150, PC-59, PAS-20, and PAS-20b) demonstrate its competitive performance and strong generalization in open-vocabulary settings.

### [67] [Geometric Observability Index: An Operator-Theoretic Framework for Per-Feature Sensitivity, Weak Observability, and Dynamic Effects in SE(3) Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05582)
*Joe-Mei Feng,Sheng-Wei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified operator-theoretic framework for analyzing per-feature sensitivity in camera pose estimation on SE(3), introducing Geometric Observability Index (GOI) that quantifies individual measurement contributions through curvature operators and Lie algebra structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical sensitivity tools (conditioning analyses, Euclidean perturbation arguments, Fisher information bounds) fail to explain how individual image features influence pose estimates or why dynamic/inconsistent observations disproportionately distort modern SLAM and structure-from-motion systems.

Method: Extends influence function theory to matrix Lie groups and derives an intrinsic perturbation operator for left-trivialized M-estimators on SE(3). Introduces Geometric Observability Index (GOI) that quantifies single measurement contributions through curvature operators and Lie algebraic structure of observable subspace, with spectral decomposition along principal directions of observable curvature.

Result: GOI reveals direct correspondence between weak observability and amplified sensitivity. In population regime, GOI coincides with Fisher information geometry on SE(3), yielding single-measurement analogue of Cramer-Rao bound. Explains classical degeneracies (pure rotation, vanishing parallax) and dynamic feature amplification along weak curvature directions.

Conclusion: GOI provides geometrically consistent description of measurement influence that unifies conditioning analysis, Fisher information geometry, influence function theory, and dynamic scene detectability through spectral geometry of curvature operator. Yields lightweight, training-free diagnostic signals for identifying dynamic features and detecting weak observability configurations without modifying existing SLAM architectures.

Abstract: We present a unified operator-theoretic framework for analyzing per-feature sensitivity in camera pose estimation on the Lie group SE(3). Classical sensitivity tools - conditioning analyses, Euclidean perturbation arguments, and Fisher information bounds - do not explain how individual image features influence the pose estimate, nor why dynamic or inconsistent observations can disproportionately distort modern SLAM and structure-from-motion systems. To address this gap, we extend influence function theory to matrix Lie groups and derive an intrinsic perturbation operator for left-trivialized M-estimators on SE(3).
  The resulting Geometric Observability Index (GOI) quantifies the contribution of a single measurement through the curvature operator and the Lie algebraic structure of the observable subspace. GOI admits a spectral decomposition along the principal directions of the observable curvature, revealing a direct correspondence between weak observability and amplified sensitivity. In the population regime, GOI coincides with the Fisher information geometry on SE(3), yielding a single-measurement analogue of the Cramer-Rao bound.
  The same spectral mechanism explains classical degeneracies such as pure rotation and vanishing parallax, as well as dynamic feature amplification along weak curvature directions. Overall, GOI provides a geometrically consistent description of measurement influence that unifies conditioning analysis, Fisher information geometry, influence function theory, and dynamic scene detectability through the spectral geometry of the curvature operator. Because these quantities arise directly within Gauss-Newton pipelines, the curvature spectrum and GOI also yield lightweight, training-free diagnostic signals for identifying dynamic features and detecting weak observability configurations without modifying existing SLAM architectures.

TL;DR: Mixed reality system for childbirth training combines virtual guidance with tactile manikin interaction, enabling independent practice without continuous expert supervision, outperforming VR-based training in medical student evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical students face limited opportunities for practical vaginal birth experience due to shortened clinical rotations, patient reluctance, and unpredictable labor. There's a need to reduce clinicians' instructional burden while enhancing trainee learning efficiency through technology-enabled independent practice.

Method: Developed a mixed reality system using commercial HMDs extended with external RGB-D camera calibration for real-time visual integration of physical training objects. Implemented a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline: first aligns maternal manikin with fiducial markers to define delivery region, then registers pre-scanned neonatal head within this area for spatially accurate overlay of virtual guiding hands.

Result: System achieved accurate and stable manikin localization on standalone headset without external computing. In user study with 83 fourth-year medical students, MR training significantly outperformed VR training in delivery, post-delivery, and overall task performance as assessed by four senior obstetricians using standardized criteria, and was consistently preferred by trainees.

Conclusion: The MR childbirth training system effectively combines virtual guidance with authentic haptic feedback, enabling independent practice while reducing expert supervision burden. It demonstrates superior learning outcomes and trainee preference over VR-based approaches, offering a practical solution for constrained clinical training environments.

Abstract: Opportunities for medical students to gain practical experience in vaginal births are increasingly constrained by shortened clinical rotations, patient reluctance, and the unpredictable nature of labour. To alleviate clinicians' instructional burden and enhance trainees' learning efficiency, we introduce a mixed reality (MR) system for childbirth training that combines virtual guidance with tactile manikin interaction, thereby preserving authentic haptic feedback while enabling independent practice without continuous on-site expert supervision. The system extends the passthrough capability of commercial head-mounted displays (HMDs) by spatially calibrating an external RGB-D camera, allowing real-time visual integration of physical training objects. Building on this capability, we implement a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline that first aligns the maternal manikin with fiducial markers to define a delivery region and then registers the pre-scanned neonatal head within this area. This process enables spatially accurate overlay of virtual guiding hands near the manikin, allowing trainees to follow expert trajectories reinforced by haptic interaction. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the system achieves accurate and stable manikin localization on a standalone headset, ensuring practical deployment without external computing resources. A large-scale user study involving 83 fourth-year medical students was subsequently conducted to compare MR-based and virtual reality (VR)-based childbirth training. Four senior obstetricians independently assessed performance using standardized criteria. Results showed that MR training achieved significantly higher scores in delivery, post-delivery, and overall task performance, and was consistently preferred by trainees over VR training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoPoseVR is an end-to-end framework for accurate, real-time full-body pose estimation in VR using headset motion cues fused with egocentric RGB-D observations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current head-mounted camera-based approaches for VR pose estimation suffer from temporal instability, inaccurate lower-body estimation, and lack of real-time performance, limiting practical VR embodiment applications.

Method: Dual-modality fusion pipeline integrating headset motion cues with egocentric RGB-D observations using spatiotemporal encoders and cross-attention, plus kinematic optimization module with HMD signal constraints.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art egocentric pose estimation models; user study shows significantly higher subjective ratings in accuracy, stability, embodiment, and intention for future use compared to baselines.

Conclusion: EgoPoseVR enables robust full-body pose tracking for accurate VR embodiment without requiring additional body-worn sensors or room-scale tracking systems, offering a practical solution for immersive VR applications.

Abstract: Immersive virtual reality (VR) applications demand accurate, temporally coherent full-body pose tracking. Recent head-mounted camera-based approaches show promise in egocentric pose estimation, but encounter challenges when applied to VR head-mounted displays (HMDs), including temporal instability, inaccurate lower-body estimation, and the lack of real-time performance. To address these limitations, we present EgoPoseVR, an end-to-end framework for accurate egocentric full-body pose estimation in VR that integrates headset motion cues with egocentric RGB-D observations through a dual-modality fusion pipeline. A spatiotemporal encoder extracts frame- and joint-level representations, which are fused via cross-attention to fully exploit complementary motion cues across modalities. A kinematic optimization module then imposes constraints from HMD signals, enhancing the accuracy and stability of pose estimation. To facilitate training and evaluation, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of over 1.8 million temporally aligned HMD and RGB-D frames across diverse VR scenarios. Experimental results show that EgoPoseVR outperforms state-of-the-art egocentric pose estimation models. A user study in real-world scenes further shows that EgoPoseVR achieved significantly higher subjective ratings in accuracy, stability, embodiment, and intention for future use compared to baseline methods. These results show that EgoPoseVR enables robust full-body pose tracking, offering a practical solution for accurate VR embodiment without requiring additional body-worn sensors or room-scale tracking systems.

TL;DR: CAViT replaces static MLPs in Vision Transformers with dynamic channel-wise self-attention, creating a dual-attention architecture that improves performance while reducing parameters and FLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Transformers use static MLPs for channel mixing that lack adaptability to input content, limiting their representational expressiveness.

Method: CAViT introduces a dual-attention architecture where each Transformer block performs spatial self-attention followed by channel-wise self-attention, replacing static MLPs with dynamic attention-based feature interaction.

Result: Outperforms standard ViT baseline by up to +3.6% accuracy across five benchmark datasets (natural and medical domains), reduces parameter count and FLOPs by over 30%, and produces sharper, semantically meaningful attention maps.

Conclusion: CAViT's unified content-aware token mixing strategy enhances representational expressiveness without increasing model depth or complexity, demonstrating the effectiveness of attention-driven feature interaction.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong performance across a range of computer vision tasks by modeling long-range spatial interactions via self-attention. However, channel-wise mixing in ViTs remains static, relying on fixed multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) that lack adaptability to input content. We introduce 'CAViT', a dual-attention architecture that replaces the static MLP with a dynamic, attention-based mechanism for feature interaction. Each Transformer block in CAViT performs spatial self-attention followed by channel-wise self-attention, allowing the model to dynamically recalibrate feature representations based on global image context. This unified and content-aware token mixing strategy enhances representational expressiveness without increasing depth or complexity. We validate CAViT across five benchmark datasets spanning both natural and medical domains, where it outperforms the standard ViT baseline by up to +3.6% in accuracy, while reducing parameter count and FLOPs by over 30%. Qualitative attention maps reveal sharper and semantically meaningful activation patterns, validating the effectiveness of our attention-driven token mixing.

*Zongliang Zhang,Shuxiang Li,Xingwang Huang,Zongyue Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust fitting method for reconstructing multiple instances of non-classical models (spiral curves, procedural character models, free-form surfaces) from noisy data using model-to-data error estimator and meta-heuristic optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust fitting methods focus on classical models (lines, circles, planes) and single-instance reconstruction, leaving a gap for handling multiple instances of non-classical models from noisy data with outliers.

Method: Formulates multi-instance fitting as optimization with two components: 1) novel estimator based on model-to-data error that handles outliers without predefined thresholds, and 2) meta-heuristic optimizer to find global optimum since estimator is non-differentiable.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness on various non-classical models. Code is publicly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: Proposed method successfully addresses the challenge of reconstructing multiple instances of non-classical models from noisy data, filling a gap in existing robust fitting literature.

Abstract: Most existing robust fitting methods are designed for classical models, such as lines, circles, and planes. In contrast, fewer methods have been developed to robustly handle non-classical models, such as spiral curves, procedural character models, and free-form surfaces. Furthermore, existing methods primarily focus on reconstructing a single instance of a non-classical model. This paper aims to reconstruct multiple instances of non-classical models from noisy data. We formulate this multi-instance fitting task as an optimization problem, which comprises an estimator and an optimizer. Specifically, we propose a novel estimator based on the model-to-data error, capable of handling outliers without a predefined error threshold. Since the proposed estimator is non-differentiable with respect to the model parameters, we employ a meta-heuristic algorithm as the optimizer to seek the global optimum. The effectiveness of our method are demonstrated through experimental results on various non-classical models. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangzongliang/fitting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian splatting methods struggle with spherical cameras (like LiDARs) due to cyclic projection and time discontinuities at azimuth boundaries, leading to incorrect particle projection. There's also a need for better handling of complex sensor distortions in autonomous driving applications.

Method: Extends 3D Gaussian splatting with: 1) Generalized rolling-shutter modeling for autonomous driving, 2) Phase modeling mechanism to handle temporal and shape discontinuities at azimuth borders, 3) Extended 3D Gaussian representation with two distinct opacity parameters to resolve geometry-color distribution mismatches.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple autonomous driving datasets (Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2, PandaSet), consistently outperforming recent baselines. Provides enhanced scene representations with improved geometric consistency and photorealistic appearance.

Conclusion: XSIM offers a unified and flexible sensor simulation framework that effectively handles complex sensor distortions in dynamic autonomous driving environments, particularly addressing critical edge cases with spherical cameras while maintaining high-quality rendering performance.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce \textbf{XSIM}, a sensor simulation framework for autonomous driving. XSIM extends 3DGUT splatting with a generalized rolling-shutter modeling tailored for autonomous driving applications. Our framework provides a unified and flexible formulation for appearance and geometric sensor modeling, enabling rendering of complex sensor distortions in dynamic environments. We identify spherical cameras, such as LiDARs, as a critical edge case for existing 3DGUT splatting due to cyclic projection and time discontinuities at azimuth boundaries leading to incorrect particle projection. To address this issue, we propose a phase modeling mechanism that explicitly accounts temporal and shape discontinuities of Gaussians projected by the Unscented Transform at azimuth borders. In addition, we introduce an extended 3D Gaussian representation that incorporates two distinct opacity parameters to resolve mismatches between geometry and color distributions. As a result, our framework provides enhanced scene representations with improved geometric consistency and photorealistic appearance. We evaluate our framework extensively on multiple autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2, and PandaSet. Our framework consistently outperforms strong recent baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

TL;DR: ROMAN is a novel scenario generation approach for ADS testing that combines multi-head attention with traffic law weighting to generate high-risk violation scenarios, outperforming existing tools in violation count and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ADS testing approaches have limited ability to generate complex, high-risk law-breaking scenarios and fail to account for complex multi-vehicle interactions and critical situations, which is crucial for safe autonomous vehicle deployment.

Method: ROMAN combines a multi-head attention network to model interactions among vehicles, traffic signals, and other factors, with a traffic law weighting mechanism that uses an LLM-based risk weighting module to evaluate violations based on severity and occurrence dimensions.

Result: ROMAN surpassed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker by achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while maintaining greater scenario diversity. It successfully generated violation scenarios for every clause of input traffic laws.

Conclusion: ROMAN enables more thorough and targeted ADS evaluation by generating high-risk violation scenarios, identifying more violations than existing approaches, and covering all traffic law clauses, making it a superior tool for comprehensive autonomous vehicle safety testing.

Abstract: Automated Driving System (ADS) acts as the brain of autonomous vehicles, responsible for their safety and efficiency. Safe deployment requires thorough testing in diverse real-world scenarios and compliance with traffic laws like speed limits, signal obedience, and right-of-way rules. Violations like running red lights or speeding pose severe safety risks. However, current testing approaches face significant challenges: limited ability to generate complex and high-risk law-breaking scenarios, and failing to account for complex interactions involving multiple vehicles and critical situations. To address these challenges, we propose ROMAN, a novel scenario generation approach for ADS testing that combines a multi-head attention network with a traffic law weighting mechanism. ROMAN is designed to generate high-risk violation scenarios to enable more thorough and targeted ADS evaluation. The multi-head attention mechanism models interactions among vehicles, traffic signals, and other factors. The traffic law weighting mechanism implements a workflow that leverages an LLM-based risk weighting module to evaluate violations based on the two dimensions of severity and occurrence. We have evaluated ROMAN by testing the Baidu Apollo ADS within the CARLA simulation platform and conducting extensive experiments to measure its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ROMAN surpassed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker by achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while also maintaining greater scenario diversity. In addition, only ROMAN successfully generated violation scenarios for every clause of the input traffic laws, enabling it to identify more high-risk violations than existing approaches.

TL;DR: UniSurg is a video-native foundation model for surgical video analysis that shifts from pixel-level reconstruction to latent motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple surgical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models for surgical video analysis waste capacity on low-level visual details (smoke, reflections, fluid motion) rather than focusing on semantic structures essential for surgical understanding. There's a need for a more efficient paradigm that prioritizes motion and semantic information.

Method: Built on Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with three key innovations: 1) motion-guided latent prediction to prioritize semantically meaningful regions, 2) spatiotemporal affinity self-distillation for relational consistency, and 3) feature diversity regularization to prevent representation collapse in texture-sparse surgical scenes. Pretrained on UniSurg-15M dataset (3,658 hours from 50 sources across 13 anatomical regions).

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods: +14.6% F1 on EgoSurgery, +10.3% on PitVis for workflow recognition; 39.54% mAP-IVT on CholecT50 for action triplet recognition; and superior performance on skill assessment, polyp segmentation, and depth estimation across 17 benchmarks.

Conclusion: UniSurg establishes a new standard for universal, motion-oriented surgical video understanding by shifting the learning paradigm from pixel-level reconstruction to latent motion prediction, demonstrating superior performance across diverse surgical tasks.

Abstract: While foundation models have advanced surgical video analysis, current approaches rely predominantly on pixel-level reconstruction objectives that waste model capacity on low-level visual details - such as smoke, specular reflections, and fluid motion - rather than semantic structures essential for surgical understanding. We present UniSurg, a video-native foundation model that shifts the learning paradigm from pixel-level reconstruction to latent motion prediction. Built on the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), UniSurg introduces three key technical innovations tailored to surgical videos: 1) motion-guided latent prediction to prioritize semantically meaningful regions, 2) spatiotemporal affinity self-distillation to enforce relational consistency, and 3) feature diversity regularization to prevent representation collapse in texture-sparse surgical scenes. To enable large-scale pretraining, we curate UniSurg-15M, the largest surgical video dataset to date, comprising 3,658 hours of video from 50 sources across 13 anatomical regions. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks demonstrate that UniSurg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on surgical workflow recognition (+14.6% F1 on EgoSurgery, +10.3% on PitVis), action triplet recognition (39.54% mAP-IVT on CholecT50), skill assessment, polyp segmentation, and depth estimation.

TL;DR: Nuance-level personality recognition using hierarchical Big-Five facets outperforms traditional trait-level models by 74% MSE reduction in audiovisual interaction data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional personality recognition models rely on broad trait scores as ground truth, which poses generalization challenges because similar trait scores can manifest through diverse, context-dependent behaviors. Limited training data exacerbates this problem.

Method: Used UDIVA v0.5 dataset and trained a transformer-based model with cross-modal (audiovisual) and cross-subject (dyad-aware) attention mechanisms to predict personality at different hierarchical levels: traits, facets, and nuances.

Result: Nuance-level models consistently outperformed facet and trait-level models, reducing mean squared error by up to 74% across different interaction scenarios.

Conclusion: Granular hierarchical levels (nuances) of the Big-Five Personality Model significantly enhance personality recognition from audiovisual interaction data compared to traditional broad trait-level approaches.

Abstract: Personality is a complex, hierarchical construct typically assessed through item-level questionnaires aggregated into broad trait scores. Personality recognition models aim to infer personality traits from different sources of behavioral data. However, reliance on broad trait scores as ground truth, combined with limited training data, poses challenges for generalization, as similar trait scores can manifest through diverse, context dependent behaviors. In this work, we explore the predictive impact of the more granular hierarchical levels of the Big-Five Personality Model, facets and nuances, to enhance personality recognition from audiovisual interaction data. Using the UDIVA v0.5 dataset, we trained a transformer-based model including cross-modal (audiovisual) and cross-subject (dyad-aware) attention mechanisms. Results show that nuance-level models consistently outperform facet and trait-level models, reducing mean squared error by up to 74% across interaction scenarios.

TL;DR: ShapeUP is a scalable 3D editing framework that uses image-conditioned latent-to-latent translation within a 3D Diffusion Transformer to enable precise, mask-free editing while maintaining structural consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D editing methods face trade-offs between visual controllability, geometric consistency, and scalability. Optimization-based methods are slow, multi-view 2D propagation suffers from visual drift, and training-free latent manipulation methods are limited by frozen priors and can't benefit from scaling.

Method: ShapeUP formulates editing as supervised latent-to-latent translation within a native 3D representation. It trains on triplets (source 3D shape, edited 2D image, edited 3D shape) using a 3D Diffusion Transformer to learn direct mapping. Uses image-as-prompt approach for fine-grained control.

Result: ShapeUP consistently outperforms current trained and training-free baselines in both identity preservation and edit fidelity. Enables fine-grained visual control over local/global edits with implicit, mask-free localization while maintaining strict structural consistency.

Conclusion: ShapeUP offers a robust and scalable paradigm for native 3D content creation by leveraging pretrained 3D foundation models while adapting them to editing through supervised training, overcoming limitations of existing 3D editing frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D foundation models have enabled the generation of high-fidelity assets, yet precise 3D manipulation remains a significant challenge. Existing 3D editing frameworks often face a difficult trade-off between visual controllability, geometric consistency, and scalability. Specifically, optimization-based methods are prohibitively slow, multi-view 2D propagation techniques suffer from visual drift, and training-free latent manipulation methods are inherently bound by frozen priors and cannot directly benefit from scaling. In this work, we present ShapeUP, a scalable, image-conditioned 3D editing framework that formulates editing as a supervised latent-to-latent translation within a native 3D representation. This formulation allows ShapeUP to build on a pretrained 3D foundation model, leveraging its strong generative prior while adapting it to editing through supervised training. In practice, ShapeUP is trained on triplets consisting of a source 3D shape, an edited 2D image, and the corresponding edited 3D shape, and learns a direct mapping using a 3D Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This image-as-prompt approach enables fine-grained visual control over both local and global edits and achieves implicit, mask-free localization, while maintaining strict structural consistency with the original asset. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ShapeUP consistently outperforms current trained and training-free baselines in both identity preservation and edit fidelity, offering a robust and scalable paradigm for native 3D content creation.

TL;DR: Two methods for detecting camera tampering in still images: rule-based and deep-learning approaches, with deep learning offering higher accuracy but rule-based being better for resource-constrained scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart cameras in outdoor surveillance are vulnerable to tampering (vandalism/environmental damage), but detecting tampering in still images is challenging without continuous video frames.

Method: Proposed two approaches: 1) Rule-based method using predefined rules/heuristics, and 2) Deep-learning-based method using neural networks for tampering detection.

Result: Deep-learning model achieves higher accuracy, while rule-based method is more suitable for resource-limited scenarios where prolonged calibration is impractical. Created public datasets with normal, blurred, and rotated images.

Conclusion: Both methods have practical applications depending on resource constraints, with deep learning offering superior accuracy and rule-based being more accessible for limited-resource deployments. Public datasets support further research.

Abstract: Recently, the use of smart cameras in outdoor settings has grown to improve surveillance and security. Nonetheless, these systems are susceptible to tampering, whether from deliberate vandalism or harsh environmental conditions, which can undermine their monitoring effectiveness. In this context, detecting camera tampering is more challenging when a camera is capturing still images rather than video as there is no sequence of continuous frames over time. In this study, we propose two approaches for detecting tampered images: a rule-based method and a deep-learning-based method. The aim is to evaluate how each method performs in terms of accuracy, computational demands, and the data required for training when applied to real-world scenarios. Our results show that the deep-learning model provides higher accuracy, while the rule-based method is more appropriate for scenarios where resources are limited and a prolonged calibration phase is impractical. We also offer publicly available datasets with normal, blurred, and rotated images to support the development and evaluation of camera tampering detection methods, addressing the need for such resources.

*Yunchuan Ma,Laiyun Qing,Guorong Li,Yuqing Liu,Yuankai Qi,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-task learning framework for point-supervised temporal action localization that introduces three self-supervised temporal understanding tasks to improve action localization by modeling temporal relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point-supervised temporal action localization methods only use point-supervised snippet-level classification without explicit modeling of temporal relationships among frames. Understanding temporal relationships is crucial for defining actions and localizing full action frames.

Method: Proposes a multi-task learning framework with three self-supervised temporal understanding tasks: (1) Action Completion, (2) Action Order Understanding, and (3) Action Regularity Understanding. These tasks leverage point supervision to enhance the model's temporal understanding capability for action localization.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: This is the first attempt to explicitly explore temporal consistency for point-supervised action localization. The proposed multi-task framework with self-supervised temporal understanding tasks effectively improves action localization performance by enhancing temporal relationship modeling.

Abstract: Point-supervised Temporal Action Localization (PTAL) adopts a lightly frame-annotated paradigm (\textit{i.e.}, labeling only a single frame per action instance) to train a model to effectively locate action instances within untrimmed videos. Most existing approaches design the task head of models with only a point-supervised snippet-level classification, without explicit modeling of understanding temporal relationships among frames of an action. However, understanding the temporal relationships of frames is crucial because it can help a model understand how an action is defined and therefore benefits localizing the full frames of an action. To this end, in this paper, we design a multi-task learning framework that fully utilizes point supervision to boost the model's temporal understanding capability for action localization. Specifically, we design three self-supervised temporal understanding tasks: (i) Action Completion, (ii) Action Order Understanding, and (iii) Action Regularity Understanding. These tasks help a model understand the temporal consistency of actions across videos. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explicitly explore temporal consistency for point supervision action localization. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.

*Lexiang Hu,Youze Xue,Dian Li,Gang Liu,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AGFF-Embed is a novel multimodal embedding method that adaptively fuses global and fine-grained perceptual information from MLLMs, achieving SOTA performance on multimodal benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal embeddings (CLIP-based and MLLM-based) only capture global semantics, but complex real-world scenarios require hybrid perception combining both global and fine-grained elements. Existing methods lack a compatible fusion mechanism for these different perceptual patterns.

Method: AGFF-Embed prompts MLLMs to generate multiple embeddings focusing on different semantic dimensions, then adaptively and smoothly aggregates them. It also incorporates Explicit Gradient Amplification (EGA) technique for in-batch hard negatives enhancement without dataset editing.

Result: Evaluation on MMEB and MMVP-VLM benchmarks shows AGFF-Embed achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and fine-grained understanding compared to other multimodal embedding models.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive fusion mechanism effectively addresses the hybrid perceptual needs of complex multimodal scenarios, demonstrating superior performance through comprehensive benchmark evaluations.

Abstract: Multimodal embeddings serve as a bridge for aligning vision and language, with the two primary implementations -- CLIP-based and MLLM-based embedding models -- both limited to capturing only global semantic information. Although numerous studies have focused on fine-grained understanding, we observe that complex scenarios currently targeted by MLLM embeddings often involve a hybrid perceptual pattern of both global and fine-grained elements, thus necessitating a compatible fusion mechanism. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Global and Fine-grained perceptual Fusion for MLLM Embeddings (AGFF-Embed), a method that prompts the MLLM to generate multiple embeddings focusing on different dimensions of semantic information, which are then adaptively and smoothly aggregated. Furthermore, we adapt AGFF-Embed with the Explicit Gradient Amplification (EGA) technique to achieve in-batch hard negatives enhancement without requiring fine-grained editing of the dataset. Evaluation on the MMEB and MMVP-VLM benchmarks shows that AGFF-Embed comprehensively achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and fine-grained understanding compared to other multimodal embedding models.

*Moussa Kassem Sbeyti,Nadja Klein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthPrior improves small object detection using depth information as prior knowledge without modifying detector architectures, achieving up to +9% mAP for small objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small and distant objects are challenging to detect due to scale variation, low resolution, and background clutter. Safety-critical applications need reliable detection, and while depth information can help, existing approaches require complex architectural modifications.

Method: DepthPrior uses depth as prior knowledge rather than fused features. It includes Depth-Based Loss Weighting (DLW) and Depth-Based Loss Stratification (DLS) during training, and Depth-Aware Confidence Thresholding (DCT) during inference. Only requires initial depth estimation overhead.

Result: Experiments across four benchmarks (KITTI, MS COCO, VisDrone, SUN RGB-D) and two detectors (YOLOv11, EfficientDet) show up to +9% mAP_S and +7% mAR_S for small objects, with inference recovery rates as high as 95:1 (true vs. false detections).

Conclusion: DepthPrior provides significant improvements for small object detection without additional sensors, architectural changes, or performance costs, offering a practical solution for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Detecting small and distant objects remains challenging for object detectors due to scale variation, low resolution, and background clutter. Safety-critical applications require reliable detection of these objects for safe planning. Depth information can improve detection, but existing approaches require complex, model-specific architectural modifications. We provide a theoretical analysis followed by an empirical investigation of the depth-detection relationship. Together, they explain how depth causes systematic performance degradation and why depth-informed supervision mitigates it. We introduce DepthPrior, a framework that uses depth as prior knowledge rather than as a fused feature, providing comparable benefits without modifying detector architectures. DepthPrior consists of Depth-Based Loss Weighting (DLW) and Depth-Based Loss Stratification (DLS) during training, and Depth-Aware Confidence Thresholding (DCT) during inference. The only overhead is the initial cost of depth estimation. Experiments across four benchmarks (KITTI, MS COCO, VisDrone, SUN RGB-D) and two detectors (YOLOv11, EfficientDet) demonstrate the effectiveness of DepthPrior, achieving up to +9% mAP$_S$ and +7% mAR$_S$ for small objects, with inference recovery rates as high as 95:1 (true vs. false detections). DepthPrior offers these benefits without additional sensors, architectural changes, or performance costs. Code is available at https://github.com/mos-ks/DepthPrior.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Living cortical neurons in vitro serve as a biological reservoir for visual pattern recognition, achieving accurate classification of MNIST digits and other visual patterns despite biological variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the natural computational properties of living neural circuits as physical reservoirs for computing, moving beyond artificial approximations of neural dynamics and integrating biological principles into machine learning frameworks.

Method: Biological reservoir computing (BRC) using cultured cortical neurons on high-density multi-electrode arrays (HD-MEA) for stimulation and readout, with a linear perceptron readout layer trained to classify neural responses to visual patterns.

Result: The system successfully classified visual patterns of increasing difficulty (from point stimuli to MNIST digits) despite biological variability, demonstrating that living neural networks can function as effective computational reservoirs.

Conclusion: In vitro cortical networks can serve as biological reservoirs for visual pattern recognition, opening new avenues for neuromorphic computing and showing how living neural systems can inform biologically grounded computational models.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neuro-inspired approach to reservoir computing (RC) in which a network of in vitro cultured cortical neurons serves as the physical reservoir. Rather than relying on artificial recurrent models to approximate neural dynamics, our biological reservoir computing (BRC) system leverages the spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity of living neural circuits as its computational substrate. A high-density multi-electrode array (HD-MEA) provides simultaneous stimulation and readout across hundreds of channels: input patterns are delivered through selected electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting high-dimensional neural responses, yielding a biologically grounded feature representation. A linear readout layer (single-layer perceptron) is then trained to classify these reservoir states, enabling the living neural network to perform static visual pattern-recognition tasks within a computer-vision framework. We evaluate the system across a sequence of tasks of increasing difficulty, ranging from pointwise stimuli to oriented bars, clock-digit-like shapes, and handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Despite the inherent variability of biological neural responses-arising from noise, spontaneous activity, and inter-session differences-the system consistently generates high-dimensional representations that support accurate classification. These results demonstrate that in vitro cortical networks can function as effective reservoirs for static visual pattern recognition, opening new avenues for integrating living neural substrates into neuromorphic computing frameworks. More broadly, this work contributes to the effort to incorporate biological principles into machine learning and supports the goals of neuro-inspired vision by illustrating how living neural systems can inform the design of efficient and biologically grounded computational models.

*Ti Wang,Xiaohang Yu,Mackenzie Weygandt Mathis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMPose3D: A flow matching-based framework for efficient multi-hypothesis 3D pose estimation from monocular images, using ODE-based generation and posterior aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D pose estimation is ill-posed due to depth ambiguity and occlusions, requiring probabilistic methods. Existing diffusion models are computationally expensive due to many timesteps, so a more efficient approach is needed.

Method: Uses Flow Matching (FM) to learn a velocity field defined by an ODE for efficient 3D pose generation. Formulates pose estimation as conditional distribution transport from Gaussian prior to plausible 3D poses conditioned on 2D inputs. Includes Reprojection-based Posterior Expectation Aggregation (RPEA) module to select best hypothesis.

Result: Surpasses existing methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks, achieves SOTA on Animal3D and CtrlAni3D datasets, demonstrating strong performance across both human and animal pose domains.

Conclusion: FMPose3D provides an efficient, accurate framework for probabilistic 3D pose estimation using flow matching, addressing computational limitations of diffusion models while maintaining strong performance across diverse pose estimation tasks.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimation is fundamentally ill-posed due to depth ambiguity and occlusions, thereby motivating probabilistic methods that generate multiple plausible 3D pose hypotheses. In particular, diffusion-based models have recently demonstrated strong performance, but their iterative denoising process typically requires many timesteps for each prediction, making inference computationally expensive. In contrast, we leverage Flow Matching (FM) to learn a velocity field defined by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE), enabling efficient generation of 3D pose samples with only a few integration steps. We propose a novel generative pose estimation framework, FMPose3D, that formulates 3D pose estimation as a conditional distribution transport problem. It continuously transports samples from a standard Gaussian prior to the distribution of plausible 3D poses conditioned only on 2D inputs. Although ODE trajectories are deterministic, FMPose3D naturally generates various pose hypotheses by sampling different noise seeds. To obtain a single accurate prediction from those hypotheses, we further introduce a Reprojection-based Posterior Expectation Aggregation (RPEA) module, which approximates the Bayesian posterior expectation over 3D hypotheses. FMPose3D surpasses existing methods on the widely used human pose estimation benchmarks Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, and further achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3D animal pose datasets Animal3D and CtrlAni3D, demonstrating strong performance across both 3D pose domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReText: A novel multimodal method for generalizable person re-identification that combines multi-camera Re-ID data with single-camera data enriched by textual descriptions, achieving state-of-the-art cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalizable person Re-ID faces domain gaps between training and unseen test domains. While single-camera data is easy to collect, it lacks cross-view variation complexity. The paper aims to leverage textual descriptions to enrich semantic cues in single-camera data for better generalization.

Method: ReText trains on a mixture of multi-camera Re-ID data and single-camera data with textual descriptions. It jointly optimizes three tasks: 1) Re-ID on multi-camera data, 2) image-text matching, and 3) text-guided image reconstruction on single-camera data.

Result: ReText achieves strong generalization and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain Re-ID benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of multimodal joint learning.

Conclusion: This is the first work to explore multimodal joint learning on mixed multi-camera and single-camera data in person Re-ID, showing that textual descriptions can effectively enrich semantic cues and improve cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Generalizable image-based person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to recognize individuals across cameras in unseen domains without retraining. While multiple existing approaches address the domain gap through complex architectures, recent findings indicate that better generalization can be achieved by stylistically diverse single-camera data. Although this data is easy to collect, it lacks complexity due to minimal cross-view variation. We propose ReText, a novel method trained on a mixture of multi-camera Re-ID data and single-camera data, where the latter is complemented by textual descriptions to enrich semantic cues. During training, ReText jointly optimizes three tasks: (1) Re-ID on multi-camera data, (2) image-text matching, and (3) image reconstruction guided by text on single-camera data. Experiments demonstrate that ReText achieves strong generalization and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain Re-ID benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore multimodal joint learning on a mixture of multi-camera and single-camera data in image-based person Re-ID.

*Hengyi Wang,Ruiqiang Zhang,Chang Liu,Guanjie Wang,Zehua Ma,Han Fang,Weiming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Allocentric Perceiver is a training-free method that uses geometric experts to reconstruct 3D states from images and transforms them into target-centric reference frames, enabling VLMs to better handle allocentric spatial reasoning without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with allocentric spatial queries that require perspective shifts from camera view to target-centric frames, which is crucial for spatially grounded tasks like Vision-Language Navigation/Action.

Method: Uses off-the-shelf geometric experts to recover metric 3D states from images, instantiates query-conditioned allocentric reference frames aligned with instruction intent, transforms reconstructed geometry into target frames, and prompts VLMs with structured geometry-grounded representations.

Result: Achieves ~10% gains on allocentric tasks while maintaining strong egocentric performance, surpassing both spatial-perception-finetuned models and state-of-the-art open-source/proprietary models across multiple backbone families.

Conclusion: By offloading mental rotation from implicit reasoning to explicit computation, Allocentric Perceiver effectively enhances VLMs' allocentric spatial reasoning capabilities without requiring training.

Abstract: With the rising need for spatially grounded tasks such as Vision-Language Navigation/Action, allocentric perception capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are receiving growing focus. However, VLMs remain brittle on allocentric spatial queries that require explicit perspective shifts, where the answer depends on reasoning in a target-centric frame rather than the observed camera view. Thus, we introduce Allocentric Perceiver, a training-free strategy that recovers metric 3D states from one or more images with off-the-shelf geometric experts, and then instantiates a query-conditioned allocentric reference frame aligned with the instruction's semantic intent. By deterministically transforming reconstructed geometry into the target frame and prompting the backbone VLM with structured, geometry-grounded representations, Allocentric Perceriver offloads mental rotation from implicit reasoning to explicit computation. We evaluate Allocentric Perciver across multiple backbone families on spatial reasoning benchmarks, observing consistent and substantial gains ($\sim$10%) on allocentric tasks while maintaining strong egocentric performance, and surpassing both spatial-perception-finetuned models and state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models.

*Enwei Tong,Yuanchao Bai,Yao Zhu,Junjun Jiang,Xianming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSR is a plug-and-play token pruning framework for vision-language models that mimics human visual question answering: focus on key evidence, scan for complementary context, and refine by aggregating relevant details, improving accuracy-efficiency trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models generate massive visual tokens that increase inference latency and memory footprint. Existing training-free token pruning methods struggle to balance local evidence and global context under aggressive compression.

Method: FSR follows a three-step human-inspired approach: 1) Focus on key evidence by combining visual importance with instruction relevance, 2) Scan for complementary context conditioned on the focused set, selecting tokens most different from focused evidence, 3) Refine scanned context by aggregating nearby informative tokens via similarity-based assignment and score-weighted merging without increasing token budget.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple VLM backbones and vision-language benchmarks show FSR consistently improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off over existing state-of-the-art pruning methods.

Conclusion: FSR provides an effective plug-and-play pruning framework that mimics human visual question answering to better balance local evidence and global context, offering practical improvements in efficiency while maintaining accuracy for vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often generate massive visual tokens that greatly increase inference latency and memory footprint; while training-free token pruning offers a practical remedy, existing methods still struggle to balance local evidence and global context under aggressive compression. We propose Focus-Scan-Refine (FSR), a human-inspired, plug-and-play pruning framework that mimics how humans answer visual questions: focus on key evidence, then scan globally if needed, and refine the scanned context by aggregating relevant details. FSR first focuses on key evidence by combining visual importance with instruction relevance, avoiding the bias toward visually salient but query-irrelevant regions. It then scans for complementary context conditioned on the focused set, selecting tokens that are most different from the focused evidence. Finally, FSR refines the scanned context by aggregating nearby informative tokens into the scan anchors via similarity-based assignment and score-weighted merging, without increasing the token budget. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM backbones and vision-language benchmarks show that FSR consistently improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off over existing state-of-the-art pruning methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NVS-HO is the first benchmark for novel view synthesis of handheld objects using only RGB inputs, featuring complementary handheld and board sequences for training and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a challenging real-world benchmark to drive progress in RGB-based novel view synthesis of handheld objects, as current methods struggle under unconstrained handheld conditions.

Method: Objects are recorded in two complementary RGB sequences: handheld sequences (object manipulated in front of static camera) and board sequences (object fixed on ChArUco board for accurate camera poses). The benchmark uses both classical SfM pipeline and pre-trained VGGT as pose estimators, with NVS models based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting.

Result: Experiments reveal significant performance gaps in current methods under unconstrained handheld conditions, highlighting the need for more robust approaches.

Conclusion: NVS-HO offers a challenging real-world benchmark that will help drive progress in RGB-based novel view synthesis of handheld objects by exposing limitations of current methods.

Abstract: We propose NVS-HO, the first benchmark designed for novel view synthesis of handheld objects in real-world environments using only RGB inputs. Each object is recorded in two complementary RGB sequences: (1) a handheld sequence, where the object is manipulated in front of a static camera, and (2) a board sequence, where the object is fixed on a ChArUco board to provide accurate camera poses via marker detection. The goal of NVS-HO is to learn a NVS model that captures the full appearance of an object from (1), whereas (2) provides the ground-truth images used for evaluation. To establish baselines, we consider both a classical SfM pipeline and a state-of-the-art pre-trained feed-forward neural network (VGGT) as pose estimators, and train NVS models based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting. Our experiments reveal significant performance gaps in current methods under unconstrained handheld conditions, highlighting the need for more robust approaches. NVS-HO thus offers a challenging real-world benchmark to drive progress in RGB-based novel view synthesis of handheld objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-centric Chain-of-Thought approaches for video reasoning suffer from representational mismatch and limited perceptual acuity, creating a need for better multimodal reasoning systems.

Method: Weaver is an end-to-end trainable multimodal reasoning agentic system that dynamically invokes diverse tools during reasoning, uses reinforcement learning to explore tool usage strategies, and constructs authentic multimodal reasoning trajectories.

Result: Extensive experiments show Weaver enhances performance on several complex video reasoning benchmarks, particularly those involving long videos.

Conclusion: Weaver successfully addresses limitations of previous approaches by enabling dynamic tool invocation and reinforcement learning, advancing multimodal video reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Video reasoning constitutes a comprehensive assessment of a model's capabilities, as it demands robust perceptual and interpretive skills, thereby serving as a means to explore the boundaries of model performance. While recent research has leveraged text-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning to augment these capabilities, such approaches frequently suffer from representational mismatch and restricted by limited perceptual acuity. To address these limitations, we propose Weaver, a novel, end-to-end trainable multimodal reasoning agentic system. Weaver empowers its policy model to dynamically invoke diverse tools throughout the reasoning process, enabling progressive acquisition of crucial visual cues and construction of authentic multimodal reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, we integrate a reinforcement learning algorithm to allow the system to freely explore strategies for employing and combining these tools with trajectory-free data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Weaver, enhances performance on several complex video reasoning benchmarks, particularly those involving long videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online RL for GUI agents suffers from inefficient credit assignment in long-horizon tasks and repetitive errors due to lack of experience transfer across tasks.

Method: Proposes UI-Mem with Hierarchical Experience Memory storing structured knowledge as parameterized templates, Stratified Group Sampling for guidance integration, and Self-Evolving Loop for continuous memory updating.

Result: Significantly outperforms traditional RL baselines and static reuse strategies on online GUI benchmarks, with strong generalization to unseen applications.

Conclusion: UI-Mem effectively addresses credit assignment and experience transfer challenges in GUI online RL through hierarchical memory and guided learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising paradigm for enhancing GUI agents through direct environment interaction. However, its effectiveness is severely hindered by inefficient credit assignment in long-horizon tasks and repetitive errors across tasks due to the lack of experience transfer. To address these challenges, we propose UI-Mem, a novel framework that enhances GUI online RL with a Hierarchical Experience Memory. Unlike traditional replay buffers, our memory accumulates structured knowledge, including high-level workflows, subtask skills, and failure patterns. These experiences are stored as parameterized templates that enable cross-task and cross-application transfer. To effectively integrate memory guidance into online RL, we introduce Stratified Group Sampling, which injects varying levels of guidance across trajectories within each rollout group to maintain outcome diversity, driving the unguided policy toward internalizing guided behaviors. Furthermore, a Self-Evolving Loop continuously abstracts novel strategies and errors to keep the memory aligned with the agent's evolving policy. Experiments on online GUI benchmarks demonstrate that UI-Mem significantly outperforms traditional RL baselines and static reuse strategies, with strong generalization to unseen applications.

TL;DR: Multi-crop strategy causes instability in SSL methods like BYOL/SimSiam due to shared predictor; using separate predictors per view type stabilizes training and improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-crop strategy enhances SSL frameworks but causes instability in predictor-based architectures (BYOL, SimSiam, MoCo v3). The authors aim to identify the cause and develop a stable multi-crop training approach.

Method: Assign separate predictors to each view type instead of sharing one across all views. Extend to treat each spatial transformation as distinct alignment task, adding cutout views (masked images). Create multi-task framework combining global, local, and masked views.

Result: Stabilizes multi-crop training, yields significant performance gains. Approach is stable, generally applicable across backbones, consistently improves ResNet and ViT models on ImageNet.

Conclusion: Shared predictor causes multi-crop instability; separate predictors per view type enable stable training. Multi-task formulation with global, local, and masked views provides effective SSL framework.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods based on Siamese networks learn visual representations by aligning different views of the same image. The multi-crop strategy, which incorporates small local crops to global ones, enhances many SSL frameworks but causes instability in predictor-based architectures such as BYOL, SimSiam, and MoCo v3. We trace this failure to the shared predictor used across all views and demonstrate that assigning a separate predictor to each view type stabilizes multi-crop training, resulting in significant performance gains. Extending this idea, we treat each spatial transformation as a distinct alignment task and add cutout views, where part of the image is masked before encoding. This yields a simple multi-task formulation of asymmetric Siamese SSL that combines global, local, and masked views into a single framework. The approach is stable, generally applicable across backbones, and consistently improves the performance of ResNet and ViT models on ImageNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distilled autoregressive diffusion models enable real-time short video synthesis but suffer from severe error accumulation during long-sequence generation. Existing Test-Time Optimization (TTO) methods work for images/short clips but fail for extended sequences due to unstable reward landscapes and hypersensitive distilled parameters.

Method: Test-Time Correction (TTC) - a training-free approach that uses the initial frame as a stable reference anchor to calibrate intermediate stochastic states along the sampling trajectory. It corrects drift by anchoring to the first frame rather than optimizing parameters.

Result: TTC seamlessly integrates with various distilled models, extends generation lengths with negligible overhead, and matches the quality of resource-intensive training-based methods on 30-second benchmarks.

Conclusion: TTC provides an effective training-free solution to error accumulation in long video generation with distilled autoregressive diffusion models, overcoming limitations of existing TTO methods through stable reference anchoring.

Abstract: Distilled autoregressive diffusion models facilitate real-time short video synthesis but suffer from severe error accumulation during long-sequence generation. While existing Test-Time Optimization (TTO) methods prove effective for images or short clips, we identify that they fail to mitigate drift in extended sequences due to unstable reward landscapes and the hypersensitivity of distilled parameters. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Test-Time Correction (TTC), a training-free alternative. Specifically, TTC utilizes the initial frame as a stable reference anchor to calibrate intermediate stochastic states along the sampling trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method seamlessly integrates with various distilled models, extending generation lengths with negligible overhead while matching the quality of resource-intensive training-based methods on 30-second benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses boundary detection in low-data regimes with computational efficiency, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications in medical imaging and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Boundary detection of irregular and translucent objects is an important problem with applications in medical imaging, environmental monitoring and manufacturing, where many of these applications are plagued with scarce labeled data and low in situ computational resources. While recent image segmentation studies focus on segmentation mask alignment with ground-truth, the task of boundary detection remains understudied, especially in the low data regime. In this work, we present a lightweight discrete diffusion contour refinement pipeline for robust boundary detection in the low data regime. We use a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) architecture with self-attention layers as the core of our pipeline, and condition on a segmentation mask, iteratively denoising a sparse contour representation. We introduce multiple novel adaptations for improved low-data efficacy and inference efficiency, including using a simplified diffusion process, a customized model architecture, and minimal post processing to produce a dense, isolated contour given a dataset of size <500 training images. Our method outperforms several SOTA baselines on the medical imaging dataset KVASIR, is competitive on HAM10K and our custom wildfire dataset, Smoke, while improving inference framerate by 3.5X.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing change detection methods have high computational costs and complexity due to Siamese encoders with temporal fusion followed by sophisticated decoders. Early fusion methods reduce overhead but still rely on complex decoders and show inferior performance compared to late fusion methods.

Method: Proposes encoder-only change detection (EoCD) that performs early fusion of temporal data and replaces the decoder with a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module, significantly reducing model complexity.

Result: EoCD demonstrates optimal balance between change detection performance and prediction speed across various encoder architectures. Shows that model performance is predominantly dependent on the encoder network, making the decoder an additional component.

Conclusion: Extensive experimentation on four challenging change detection datasets reveals the effectiveness of the proposed EoCD method, which bridges the gap between performance and complexity in change detection tasks.

Abstract: Being a cornerstone of temporal analysis, change detection has been playing a pivotal role in modern earth observation. Existing change detection methods rely on the Siamese encoder to individually extract temporal features followed by temporal fusion. Subsequently, these methods design sophisticated decoders to improve the change detection performance without taking into consideration the complexity of the model. These aforementioned issues intensify the overall computational cost as well as the network's complexity which is undesirable. Alternatively, few methods utilize the early fusion scheme to combine the temporal images. These methods prevent the extra overhead of Siamese encoder, however, they also rely on sophisticated decoders for better performance. In addition, these methods demonstrate inferior performance as compared to late fusion based methods. To bridge these gaps, we introduce encoder only change detection (EoCD) that is a simple and effective method for the change detection task. The proposed method performs the early fusion of the temporal data and replaces the decoder with a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module thereby significantly reducing the overall complexity of the model. EoCD demonstrate the optimal balance between the change detection performance and the prediction speed across a variety of encoder architectures. Additionally, EoCD demonstrate that the performance of the model is predominantly dependent on the encoder network, making the decoder an additional component. Extensive experimentation on four challenging change detection datasets reveals the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: A neural implicit method reconstructs 3D cardiac shapes from sparse CT planes mimicking 2D echocardiography views, achieving better accuracy than clinical standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D cardiac representations enable quantitative analysis, but 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) provides only sparse views. There's a need to reconstruct complete 3D cardiac shapes from limited 2D TTE data for better anatomical and functional assessment.

Method: Uses neural implicit function with multi-layer perceptron to learn shape priors from 3D CTA segmentations. At test time, reconstructs 3D cardiac shapes from TTE-mimicking CTA planes by jointly optimizing latent codes and rigid transforms that map observed planes into 3D space.

Result: Achieves average Dice coefficient of 0.86 ± 0.04 across all structures. Significantly outperforms clinical standard (Simpson's biplane rule): left ventricle volume error 4.88 ± 4.26 mL vs 8.14 ± 6.04 mL; left atrium volume error 6.40 ± 7.37 mL vs 37.76 ± 22.96 mL.

Conclusion: The approach offers a viable route to more accurate 3D chamber quantification in 2D transthoracic echocardiography, potentially improving clinical cardiac assessment from standard 2D ultrasound views.

Abstract: Accurate 3D representations of cardiac structures allow quantitative analysis of anatomy and function. In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing complete 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of sparse planes in CT angiography (CTA) for application in 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Our method uses a neural implicit function to reconstruct the 3D shape of the cardiac chambers and left-ventricle myocardium from sparse CTA planes. To investigate the feasibility of achieving 3D reconstruction from 2D TTE, we select planes that mimic the standard apical 2D TTE views. During training, a multi-layer perceptron learns shape priors from 3D segmentations of the target structures in CTA. At test time, the network reconstructs 3D cardiac shapes from segmentations of TTE-mimicking CTA planes by jointly optimizing the latent code and the rigid transforms that map the observed planes into 3D space. For each heart, we simulate four realistic apical views, and we compare reconstructed multi-class volumes with the reference CTA volumes. On a held-out set of CTA segmentations, our approach achieves an average Dice coefficient of 0.86 $\pm$ 0.04 across all structures. Our method also achieves markedly lower volume errors than the clinical standard, Simpson's biplane rule: 4.88 $\pm$ 4.26 mL vs. 8.14 $\pm$ 6.04 mL, respectively, for the left ventricle; and 6.40 $\pm$ 7.37 mL vs. 37.76 $\pm$ 22.96 mL, respectively, for the left atrium. This suggests that our approach offers a viable route to more accurate 3D chamber quantification in 2D transthoracic echocardiography.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-Map: A novel mapping-based compression framework for CLIP that uses learnable matrices to map and combine pretrained weights via Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization, outperforming select-based compression methods especially at high compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP suffers from high memory and computation costs that limit its use in resource-limited scenarios. Existing select-based compression methods (mask optimization or important weight measurement) compromise feature representation ability, especially under extreme compression.

Method: Proposes CLIP-Map framework using learnable matrices to map and combine pretrained weights via Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization. Introduces Diagonal Inheritance Initialization to mitigate optimization challenges and reduce distribution shifting for efficient mapping learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show CLIP-Map outperforms select-based frameworks across various compression ratios, with particularly significant gains observed under high compression settings.

Conclusion: CLIP-Map provides an effective mapping-based alternative to select-based CLIP compression, better preserving original weight information and achieving superior performance, especially in extreme compression scenarios.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved widely applications in various computer vision tasks, e.g., text-to-image generation, Image-Text retrieval and Image captioning. However, CLIP suffers from high memory and computation cost, which prohibits its usage to the resource-limited application scenarios. Existing CLIP compression methods typically reduce the size of pre-trained CLIP weights by selecting their subset as weight inheritance for further retraining via mask optimization or important weight measurement. However, these select-based weight inheritance often compromises the feature presentation ability, especially on the extreme compression. In this paper, we propose a novel mapping-based CLIP compression framework, CLIP-Map. It leverages learnable matrices to map and combine pretrained weights by Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization, aiming to preserve as much information from the original weights as possible. To mitigate the optimization challenges introduced by the learnable mapping, we propose Diagonal Inheritance Initialization to reduce the distribution shifting problem for efficient and effective mapping learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP-Map outperforms select-based frameworks across various compression ratios, with particularly significant gains observed under high compression settings.

*Lingrui Li,Yanfeng Zhou,Nan Pu,Xin Chen,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGIPT proposes multi-scale global-instance prompt tuning for continual test-time adaptation in medical image segmentation, addressing distribution shifts across clinical centers while mitigating error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution shift in medical images from different clinical centers hinders deployment of pre-trained segmentation models. Existing CTTA methods suffer from error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting, while prompt-tuning approaches lack multi-scale diversity, instance-specific knowledge, and have privacy risks.

Method: MGIPT combines Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt (AIP) for lightweight instance-specific prompts with adaptive scale selection, and Multi-scale Global-level Prompt (MGP) for domain-level knowledge across scales. Uses weighted ensemble for dual-level adaptation integrating global and local information.

Result: Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation benchmarks show MGIPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust adaptation across continually changing target domains.

Conclusion: MGIPT effectively addresses limitations of existing CTTA methods by enhancing prompt scale diversity and capturing both global- and instance-level knowledge, enabling robust adaptation to distribution shifts in medical imaging.

Abstract: Distribution shift is a common challenge in medical images obtained from different clinical centers, significantly hindering the deployment of pre-trained semantic segmentation models in real-world applications across multiple domains. Continual Test-Time Adaptation(CTTA) has emerged as a promising approach to address cross-domain shifts during continually evolving target domains. Most existing CTTA methods rely on incrementally updating model parameters, which inevitably suffer from error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting, especially in long-term adaptation. Recent prompt-tuning-based works have shown potential to mitigate the two issues above by updating only visual prompts. While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance, several limitations remain:1)lacking multi-scale prompt diversity, 2)inadequate incorporation of instance-specific knowledge, and 3)risk of privacy leakage. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning(MGIPT), to enhance scale diversity of prompts and capture both global- and instance-level knowledge for robust CTTA. Specifically, MGIPT consists of an Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt(AIP) and a Multi-scale Global-level Prompt(MGP). AIP dynamically learns lightweight and instance-specific prompts to mitigate error accumulation with adaptive optimal-scale selection mechanism. MGP captures domain-level knowledge across different scales to ensure robust adaptation with anti-forgetting capabilities. These complementary components are combined through a weighted ensemble approach, enabling effective dual-level adaptation that integrates both global and local information. Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our MGIPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust adaptation across continually changing target domains.

*Junwan Kim,Jiho Park,Seonghu Jeon,Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes learning condition-dependent source distributions for flow matching in text-to-image generation, showing it improves performance and convergence compared to standard Gaussian sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow matching typically uses standard Gaussian source distributions inherited from diffusion models, without optimizing the source distribution itself. The authors argue that principled design of source distributions can better exploit conditioning signals and improve performance in modern text-to-image systems.

Method: The paper proposes learning condition-dependent source distributions under flow matching objectives. It addresses failure modes like distributional collapse and instability through variance regularization and directional alignment between source and target. The authors also analyze how target representation space impacts flow matching with structured sources.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple text-to-image benchmarks show consistent improvements, including up to 3x faster convergence in FID (Fréchet Inception Distance). The approach demonstrates robust performance gains over standard Gaussian source distributions.

Conclusion: Principled design of source distributions is feasible and beneficial for conditional flow matching in text-to-image generation, offering practical advantages in convergence speed and overall performance.

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion-based generative models, particularly for text-to-image generation. Despite its flexibility in allowing arbitrary source distributions, most existing approaches rely on a standard Gaussian distribution, a choice inherited from diffusion models, and rarely consider the source distribution itself as an optimization target in such settings. In this work, we show that principled design of the source distribution is not only feasible but also beneficial at the scale of modern text-to-image systems. Specifically, we propose learning a condition-dependent source distribution under flow matching objective that better exploit rich conditioning signals. We identify key failure modes that arise when directly incorporating conditioning into the source, including distributional collapse and instability, and show that appropriate variance regularization and directional alignment between source and target are critical for stable and effective learning. We further analyze how the choice of target representation space impacts flow matching with structured sources, revealing regimes in which such designs are most effective. Extensive experiments across multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate consistent and robust improvements, including up to a 3x faster convergence in FID, highlighting the practical benefits of a principled source distribution design for conditional flow matching.

TL;DR: LSA (Localized Semantic Alignment) is a framework that fine-tunes pre-trained video generation models to enhance temporal consistency without needing control signals at inference time, using semantic feature alignment around dynamic objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing controllable video generation methods for autonomous driving require control signals at inference time to achieve temporal consistency, which limits their scalability and generalizability as data engines.

Method: LSA fine-tunes pre-trained video generation models by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips localized around dynamic objects. It uses an off-the-shelf feature extraction model to compute semantic feature consistency loss, which is combined with standard diffusion loss for fine-tuning.

Result: The model fine-tuned for just one epoch with LSA outperforms baselines in common video generation metrics. When tested with adapted object detection metrics (mAP and mIoU) on nuScenes and KITTI datasets, it shows improved temporal consistency without external control signals or computational overhead at inference.

Conclusion: LSA provides an effective framework for enhancing temporal consistency in video generation for autonomous driving without requiring control signals during inference, making it more scalable and generalizable as a data engine.

Abstract: Controllable video generation has emerged as a versatile tool for autonomous driving, enabling realistic synthesis of traffic scenarios. However, existing methods depend on control signals at inference time to guide the generative model towards temporally consistent generation of dynamic objects, limiting their utility as scalable and generalizable data engines. In this work, we propose Localized Semantic Alignment (LSA), a simple yet effective framework for fine-tuning pre-trained video generation models. LSA enhances temporal consistency by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips. Specifically, we compare the output of an off-the-shelf feature extraction model between the ground-truth and generated video clips localized around dynamic objects inducing a semantic feature consistency loss. We fine-tune the base model by combining this loss with the standard diffusion loss. The model fine-tuned for a single epoch with our novel loss outperforms the baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics. To further test the temporal consistency in generated videos we adapt two additional metrics from object detection task, namely mAP and mIoU. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing temporal consistency in video generation without the need for external control signals during inference and any computational overheads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative video models achieve high visual fidelity but lack the ability to internalize and reason over implicit world rules, creating a gap in evaluating deep cognitive reasoning capabilities.

Method: Created RISE-Video benchmark with 467 human-annotated samples across 8 reasoning categories, introduced 4 evaluation metrics (Reasoning Alignment, Temporal Consistency, Physical Rationality, Visual Quality), and developed an automated LMM-based pipeline for scalable assessment.

Result: Extensive experiments on 11 state-of-the-art TI2V models revealed pervasive deficiencies in simulating complex scenarios under implicit constraints, showing current models struggle with reasoning tasks despite good visual quality.

Conclusion: RISE-Video provides a structured testbed for evaluating reasoning capabilities in video generation, revealing critical gaps in current models' ability to simulate complex world scenarios, offering insights for advancing world-simulating generative models.

Abstract: While generative video models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, their capacity to internalize and reason over implicit world rules remains a critical yet under-explored frontier. To bridge this gap, we present RISE-Video, a pioneering reasoning-oriented benchmark for Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) synthesis that shifts the evaluative focus from surface-level aesthetics to deep cognitive reasoning. RISE-Video comprises 467 meticulously human-annotated samples spanning eight rigorous categories, providing a structured testbed for probing model intelligence across diverse dimensions, ranging from commonsense and spatial dynamics to specialized subject domains. Our framework introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol consisting of four metrics: \textit{Reasoning Alignment}, \textit{Temporal Consistency}, \textit{Physical Rationality}, and \textit{Visual Quality}. To further support scalable evaluation, we propose an automated pipeline leveraging Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to emulate human-centric assessment. Extensive experiments on 11 state-of-the-art TI2V models reveal pervasive deficiencies in simulating complex scenarios under implicit constraints, offering critical insights for the advancement of future world-simulating generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisRefiner: A training framework that improves screenshot-to-code generation by teaching models to learn from visual differences between rendered predictions and reference designs, enabling both better single-step generation and self-refinement capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal LLMs generate code directly from screenshots but lack the iterative refinement process that human developers use - they don't observe the visual outcomes of their generated code or learn from visual differences between implementation and design.

Method: 1) Construct difference-aligned supervision that associates visual discrepancies with corresponding code edits; 2) Introduce reinforcement learning for self-refinement where the model improves generated code by observing rendered output, target design, identifying visual differences, and updating code accordingly.

Result: VisRefiner substantially improves single-step generation quality and layout fidelity, while also endowing models with strong self-refinement ability.

Conclusion: Learning from visual differences is effective for advancing screenshot-to-code generation, mimicking the iterative refinement process used by human developers.

Abstract: Screenshot-to-code generation aims to translate user interface screenshots into executable frontend code that faithfully reproduces the target layout and style. Existing multimodal large language models perform this mapping directly from screenshots but are trained without observing the visual outcomes of their generated code. In contrast, human developers iteratively render their implementation, compare it with the design, and learn how visual differences relate to code changes. Inspired by this process, we propose VisRefiner, a training framework that enables models to learn from visual differences between rendered predictions and reference designs. We construct difference-aligned supervision that associates visual discrepancies with corresponding code edits, allowing the model to understand how appearance variations arise from implementation changes. Building on this, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage for self-refinement, where the model improves its generated code by observing both the rendered output and the target design, identifying their visual differences, and updating the code accordingly. Experiments show that VisRefiner substantially improves single-step generation quality and layout fidelity, while also endowing models with strong self-refinement ability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning from visual differences for advancing screenshot-to-code generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation methods for visual generation models are inadequate as they can't keep pace with rapid model advancements. Current absolute pointwise scoring standards suffer from stochastic inconsistency and poor alignment with human perception.

Method: GenArena uses a pairwise comparison paradigm instead of pointwise scoring. It leverages Vision-Language Models as surrogate judges to compare generated outputs in pairs, creating a more stable evaluation framework.

Result: Pairwise evaluation enables off-the-shelf open-source models to outperform top-tier proprietary models. The method boosts evaluation accuracy by over 20% and achieves Spearman correlation of 0.86 with authoritative benchmarks, compared to 0.36 for pointwise methods.

Conclusion: GenArena provides a rigorous, automated evaluation standard for visual generation models across diverse tasks, offering a more reliable alternative to traditional pointwise scoring methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of visual generation models has outpaced traditional evaluation approaches, necessitating the adoption of Vision-Language Models as surrogate judges. In this work, we systematically investigate the reliability of the prevailing absolute pointwise scoring standard, across a wide spectrum of visual generation tasks. Our analysis reveals that this paradigm is limited due to stochastic inconsistency and poor alignment with human perception. To resolve these limitations, we introduce GenArena, a unified evaluation framework that leverages a pairwise comparison paradigm to ensure stable and human-aligned evaluation. Crucially, our experiments uncover a transformative finding that simply adopting this pairwise protocol enables off-the-shelf open-source models to outperform top-tier proprietary models. Notably, our method boosts evaluation accuracy by over 20% and achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.86 with the authoritative LMArena leaderboard, drastically surpassing the 0.36 correlation of pointwise methods. Based on GenArena, we benchmark state-of-the-art visual generation models across diverse tasks, providing the community with a rigorous and automated evaluation standard for visual generation.

TL;DR: Context Forcing trains long-context video generation models using a long-context teacher to eliminate student-teacher mismatch, enabling 20+ second context lengths with superior temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing real-time long video generation methods suffer from student-teacher mismatch where short-context teachers can't guide students on long-term dependencies, limiting context length and temporal consistency.

Method: Proposes Context Forcing framework with long-context teacher aware of full generation history, plus Slow-Fast Memory architecture to manage computational complexity for extreme durations (e.g., 2 minutes).

Result: Achieves effective context lengths exceeding 20 seconds (2-10x longer than SOTA), preserves superior consistency across long durations, and outperforms baselines like LongLive and Infinite-RoPE on long video metrics.

Conclusion: Context Forcing resolves the fundamental student-teacher mismatch in long video generation, enabling robust training of models with extended context and superior long-term temporal consistency.

Abstract: Recent approaches to real-time long video generation typically employ streaming tuning strategies, attempting to train a long-context student using a short-context (memoryless) teacher. In these frameworks, the student performs long rollouts but receives supervision from a teacher limited to short 5-second windows. This structural discrepancy creates a critical \textbf{student-teacher mismatch}: the teacher's inability to access long-term history prevents it from guiding the student on global temporal dependencies, effectively capping the student's context length. To resolve this, we propose \textbf{Context Forcing}, a novel framework that trains a long-context student via a long-context teacher. By ensuring the teacher is aware of the full generation history, we eliminate the supervision mismatch, enabling the robust training of models capable of long-term consistency. To make this computationally feasible for extreme durations (e.g., 2 minutes), we introduce a context management system that transforms the linearly growing context into a \textbf{Slow-Fast Memory} architecture, significantly reducing visual redundancy. Extensive results demonstrate that our method enables effective context lengths exceeding 20 seconds -- 2 to 10 times longer than state-of-the-art methods like LongLive and Infinite-RoPE. By leveraging this extended context, Context Forcing preserves superior consistency across long durations, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on various long video evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: Splat and Distill framework enhances 2D Vision Foundation Models with 3D awareness through feed-forward 3D reconstruction and feature distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) excel at 2D tasks but lack 3D awareness, limiting their understanding of spatial relationships and geometry in visual data.

Method: The framework lifts 2D features from a teacher model into explicit 3D Gaussian representations, then splats these 3D features onto novel viewpoints to create supervision for distilling geometrically grounded knowledge into a student model.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior works on monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation, achieving substantial gains in 3D awareness while enhancing semantic richness of 2D features.

Conclusion: The Splat and Distill framework successfully instills robust 3D awareness into 2D VFMs through a feed-forward 3D reconstruction approach, creating a dynamic learning process that improves both teacher consistency and student performance across multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have achieved remarkable success when applied to various downstream 2D tasks. Despite their effectiveness, they often exhibit a critical lack of 3D awareness. To this end, we introduce Splat and Distill, a framework that instills robust 3D awareness into 2D VFMs by augmenting the teacher model with a fast, feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline. Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling" geometrically grounded knowledge. By replacing slow per-scene optimization of prior work with our feed-forward lifting approach, our framework avoids feature-averaging artifacts, creating a dynamic learning process where the teacher's consistency improves alongside that of the student. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on a suite of downstream tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation. Our method significantly outperforms prior works, not only achieving substantial gains in 3D awareness but also enhancing the underlying semantic richness of 2D features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal retrieval approaches are largely language-driven with static visual encodings, lacking active visual verification which leads to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases.

Method: Reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process where MLLMs selectively acquire visual evidence via external visual tools, using a multimodal interleaved reasoning process alternating between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification. Trained with curriculum-based learning combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with evidence-aligned objective.

Result: Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks show consistent improvements: 23.0% average improvement in retrieval accuracy, better perception-driven reasoning reliability, and improved generalization.

Conclusion: V-Retrver demonstrates that evidence-driven retrieval with active visual verification significantly outperforms existing language-driven approaches, providing more reliable and accurate multimodal retrieval through agentic reasoning grounded in visual inspection.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently been applied to universal multimodal retrieval, where Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves candidate reranking. However, existing approaches remain largely language-driven, relying on static visual encodings and lacking the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, which often leads to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases. We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoThinker is a framework that enables MLLMs to actively retrieve geometric evidence based on reasoning demands, rather than passively fusing global geometry streams, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM spatial reasoning approaches use passive fusion of geometric priors, leading to semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals due to indiscriminate feature mixing.

Method: GeoThinker uses Spatial-Grounded Fusion at selected VLM layers where semantic visual priors selectively query task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, calibrated by Importance Gating that biases attention toward relevant structures.

Result: Achieves new SOTA with 72.6 peak score on VSI-Bench, demonstrates robust generalization and improved spatial perception in complex downstream scenarios like embodied referring and autonomous driving.

Conclusion: Active integration of spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence, shifting from passive fusion to active perception paradigm.

Abstract: Recent progress in spatial reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly leverages geometric priors from 3D encoders. However, most existing integration strategies remain passive: geometry is exposed as a global stream and fused in an indiscriminate manner, which often induces semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals. We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving. Our results indicate that the ability to actively integrate spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence. Code can be found at https://github.com/Li-Hao-yuan/GeoThinker.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwimBird is a reasoning-switchable MLLM that dynamically chooses among text-only, vision-only, and interleaved vision-text reasoning modes based on input queries, overcoming limitations of fixed reasoning patterns in existing MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs primarily use textual Chain-of-Thought reasoning, which limits effectiveness on vision-intensive tasks. Recent approaches that inject fixed visual thoughts improve visual performance but degrade text-based logical reasoning. The core limitation is rigid, pre-defined reasoning patterns that cannot adaptively choose suitable thinking modalities for different queries.

Method: SwimBird uses a hybrid autoregressive formulation unifying next-token prediction for textual thoughts with next-embedding prediction for visual thoughts. It employs systematic reasoning-mode curation to construct SwimBird-SFT-92K, a diverse supervised fine-tuning dataset covering all three reasoning patterns (text-only, vision-only, interleaved vision-text).

Result: SwimBird achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks covering textual reasoning and challenging visual understanding. It preserves strong textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks, showing robust gains over prior fixed-pattern multimodal reasoning methods.

Conclusion: Dynamic, query-adaptive reasoning mode selection enables MLLMs to maintain strong textual reasoning capabilities while significantly enhancing visual understanding performance, representing an advancement over rigid reasoning patterns in multimodal models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in multimodal perception and reasoning by bridging vision and language. However, most existing MLLMs perform reasoning primarily with textual CoT, which limits their effectiveness on vision-intensive tasks. Recent approaches inject a fixed number of continuous hidden states as "visual thoughts" into the reasoning process and improve visual performance, but often at the cost of degraded text-based logical reasoning. We argue that the core limitation lies in a rigid, pre-defined reasoning pattern that cannot adaptively choose the most suitable thinking modality for different user queries. We introduce SwimBird, a reasoning-switchable MLLM that dynamically switches among three reasoning modes conditioned on the input: (1) text-only reasoning, (2) vision-only reasoning (continuous hidden states as visual thoughts), and (3) interleaved vision-text reasoning. To enable this capability, we adopt a hybrid autoregressive formulation that unifies next-token prediction for textual thoughts with next-embedding prediction for visual thoughts, and design a systematic reasoning-mode curation strategy to construct SwimBird-SFT-92K, a diverse supervised fine-tuning dataset covering all three reasoning patterns. By enabling flexible, query-adaptive mode selection, SwimBird preserves strong textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks. Experiments across diverse benchmarks covering textual reasoning and challenging visual understanding demonstrate that SwimBird achieves state-of-the-art results and robust gains over prior fixed-pattern multimodal reasoning methods.

*Xuejun Zhang,Aditi Tiwari,Zhenhailong Wang,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAMCUE is a pose-aware multi-image framework that uses camera pose as geometric anchor for cross-view fusion and novel-view reasoning, improving spatial reasoning accuracy by 9.06% while dramatically reducing inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models struggle with multi-image spatial reasoning, particularly perspective taking where models need to build coherent 3D understanding from multiple viewpoints and reason from new, language-specified viewpoints.

Method: CAMCUE injects per-view camera pose into visual tokens, grounds natural-language viewpoint descriptions to target camera poses, and synthesizes pose-conditioned imagined target views to support answering. The framework uses explicit geometric anchors for cross-view fusion.

Result: CAMCUE improves overall accuracy by 9.06%, predicts target poses from natural-language descriptions with over 90% rotation accuracy within 20° and translation accuracy within 0.5 error threshold, and reduces inference time from 256.6s to 1.45s per example.

Conclusion: CAMCUE demonstrates that explicit pose awareness enables efficient and accurate multi-view spatial reasoning, avoiding expensive test-time search-and-match while enabling fast, interactive use in real-world scenarios through direct grounding of language to geometry.

Abstract: Multi-image spatial reasoning remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While single-view perception is inherently 2D, reasoning over multiple views requires building a coherent scene understanding across viewpoints. In particular, we study perspective taking, where a model must build a coherent 3D understanding from multi-view observations and use it to reason from a new, language-specified viewpoint. We introduce CAMCUE, a pose-aware multi-image framework that uses camera pose as an explicit geometric anchor for cross-view fusion and novel-view reasoning. CAMCUE injects per-view pose into visual tokens, grounds natural-language viewpoint descriptions to a target camera pose, and synthesizes a pose-conditioned imagined target view to support answering. To support this setting, we curate CAMCUE-DATA with 27,668 training and 508 test instances pairing multi-view images and poses with diverse target-viewpoint descriptions and perspective-shift questions. We also include human-annotated viewpoint descriptions in the test split to evaluate generalization to human language. CAMCUE improves overall accuracy by 9.06% and predicts target poses from natural-language viewpoint descriptions with over 90% rotation accuracy within 20° and translation accuracy within a 0.5 error threshold. This direct grounding avoids expensive test-time search-and-match, reducing inference time from 256.6s to 1.45s per example and enabling fast, interactive use in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper presents a transfer learning framework using DenseNet201 and ResNet50 for classifying PCOS from ovarian ultrasound images, achieving 99.80% accuracy with data augmentation and explainable AI techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCOS is a common disorder affecting reproductive-age women with serious long-term complications like infertility and cardiovascular risks, making early detection crucial. Current diagnostic methods may benefit from automated, accurate systems.

Method: The authors designed a transfer learning framework using DenseNet201 and ResNet50 architectures. They used a dataset of 3856 ultrasound images (cyst-infected vs non-infected), resized to 224x224 pixels with pathological indicators. Employed MixUp and CutMix augmentation strategies with alpha values of 0.25 and 0.4. Used XAI approaches (SHAP, Grad-CAM, LIME) for model interpretability.

Result: Achieved peak validation accuracy of 99.80% using DenseNet201 with validation loss of 0.617. The model demonstrated high performance in classifying ovarian ultrasound images for PCOS detection.

Conclusion: The study proposes an effective automated system for medical image diagnosis that can be confidently used in clinical practice, with high accuracy and transparency through explainable AI techniques.

Abstract: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a widespread disorder in women of reproductive age, characterized by a hormonal imbalance, irregular periods, and multiple ovarian cysts. Infertility, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular risks are long-term complications that make early detection essential. In this paper, we design a powerful framework based on transfer learning utilizing DenseNet201 and ResNet50 for classifying ovarian ultrasound images. The model was trained on an online dataset containing 3856 ultrasound images of cyst-infected and non-infected patients. Each ultrasound frame was resized to 224x224 pixels and encoded with precise pathological indicators. The MixUp and CutMix augmentation strategies were used to improve generalization, yielding a peak validation accuracy of 99.80% by Densenet201 and a validation loss of 0.617 with alpha values of 0.25 and 0.4, respectively. We evaluated the model's interpretability using leading Explainable AI (XAI) approaches such as SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME, reasoning with and presenting explicit visual reasons for the model's behaviors, therefore increasing the model's transparency. This study proposes an automated system for medical picture diagnosis that may be used effectively and confidently in clinical practice.

TL;DR: AI model predicts temporal order of MR-Linac images to detect subtle radiation-induced changes over short intervals (average 2 days) during radiotherapy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether routinely acquired longitudinal MR-Linac images can be leveraged to characterize treatment-induced changes during radiotherapy, particularly subtle inter-fraction changes over short intervals.

Method: Retrospective study of 0.35T MR-Linac images from 761 patients. Deep learning model predicts temporal order of paired images, trained first with first/last fractions (F1-FL), then all pairs. Performance assessed via accuracy/AUC, compared to radiologist, with saliency map evaluation and input ablation experiments to identify affected anatomical regions.

Primary regions driving predictions: prostate, bladder, and pubic symphysis. Model detects radiation-induced changes over 1-2 days.

Conclusion: Model accurately predicts temporal order of MR-Linac fractions and detects radiation-induced changes over short intervals, including prostate and adjacent organ alterations. Underscores MR-Linac's potential for advanced image analysis beyond image guidance.

Abstract: Purpose: To investigate whether routinely acquired longitudinal MR-Linac images can be leveraged to characterize treatment-induced changes during radiotherapy, particularly subtle inter-fraction changes over short intervals (average of 2 days). Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included a series of 0.35T MR-Linac images from 761 patients. An artificial intelligence (deep learning) model was used to characterize treatment-induced changes by predicting the temporal order of paired images. The model was first trained with the images from the first and the last fractions (F1-FL), then with all pairs (All-pairs). Model performance was assessed using quantitative metrics (accuracy and AUC), compared to a radiologist's performance, and qualitative analyses - the saliency map evaluation to investigate affected anatomical regions. Input ablation experiments were performed to identify the anatomical regions altered by radiotherapy. The radiologist conducted an additional task on partial images reconstructed by saliency map regions, reporting observations as well. Quantitative image analysis was conducted to investigate the results from the model and the radiologist. Results: The F1-FL model yielded near-perfect performance (AUC of 0.99), significantly outperforming the radiologist. The All-pairs model yielded an AUC of 0.97. This performance reflects therapy-induced changes, supported by the performance correlation to fraction intervals, ablation tests and expert's interpretation. Primary regions driving the predictions were prostate, bladder, and pubic symphysis. Conclusion: The model accurately predicts temporal order of MR-Linac fractions and detects radiation-induced changes over one or a few days, including prostate and adjacent organ alterations confirmed by experts. This underscores MR-Linac's potential for advanced image analysis beyond image guidance.

TL;DR: Deep learning model improves pediatric white matter segmentation over TractSeg using modified 2D UNet with pediatric-specific bundle definitions and masked Dice loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current white matter segmentation methods lack pediatric-specific approaches, limiting understanding of neurodevelopment and individualized anatomy in pediatric white matter disorders.

Method: Modified TractSeg's 2D UNet architecture with pediatric-specific bundle definitions, k-fold cross validation, and masked Dice loss function. Evaluated on 56 manually labelled bundles with statistical comparison to TractSeg.

Result: Statistically significant improvements across all bundles for most metrics (Dice score, volume overlap, adjacency voxels) except one volume overlap case. Combined output creates smoother, continuous masks.

Conclusion: Pediatric-specific deep learning approach significantly improves white matter segmentation, enabling better neurodevelopmental studies and individualized anatomical estimates for pediatric white matter disorders.

Abstract: White matter segmentation methods from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging range from streamline clustering-based approaches to bundle mask delineation, but none have proposed a pediatric-specific approach. We hypothesize that a deep learning model with a similar approach to TractSeg will improve similarity between an algorithm-generated mask and an expert-labeled ground truth. Given a cohort of 56 manually labelled white matter bundles, we take inspiration from TractSeg's 2D UNet architecture, and we modify inputs to match bundle definitions as determined by pediatric experts, evaluation to use k fold cross validation, the loss function to masked Dice loss. We evaluate Dice score, volume overlap, and volume overreach of 16 major regions of interest compared to the expert labeled dataset. To test whether our approach offers statistically significant improvements over TractSeg, we compare Dice voxels, volume overlap, and adjacency voxels with a Wilcoxon signed rank test followed by false discovery rate correction. We find statistical significance across all bundles for all metrics with one exception in volume overlap. After we run TractSeg and our model, we combine their output masks into a 60 label atlas to evaluate if TractSeg and our model combined can generate a robust, individualized atlas, and observe smoothed, continuous masks in cases that TractSeg did not produce an anatomically plausible output. With the improvement of white matter pathway segmentation masks, we can further understand neurodevelopment on a population level scale, and we can produce reliable estimates of individualized anatomy in pediatric white matter diseases and disorders.

*Maojun Zhang,Haotian Wu,Richeng Jin,Deniz Gunduz,Krystian Mikolajczyk*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A video compression framework using generative diffusion models and semantic representations for extremely low bit-rate compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video codecs and learning-based approaches fail at semantic reconstruction at extremely low bit-rates because they rely on low-level spatiotemporal redundancies rather than high-level semantic understanding.

Method: Integrates generative priors by compressing high-level semantic representations and using conditional diffusion models for reconstruction. Motion is characterized with global camera trajectories and foreground segmentation - background motion represented by camera pose parameters, foreground dynamics by sparse segmentation masks.

Result: Significantly boosts compression efficiency, enabling decent video reconstruction at extremely low bit-rates.

Conclusion: Generative models, especially diffusion models, offer a new paradigm for video compression by leveraging high-level semantic understanding and powerful visual synthesis for extreme low bit-rate applications.

Abstract: Modern video codecs and learning-based approaches struggle for semantic reconstruction at extremely low bit-rates due to reliance on low-level spatiotemporal redundancies. Generative models, especially diffusion models, offer a new paradigm for video compression by leveraging high-level semantic understanding and powerful visual synthesis. This paper propose a video compression framework that integrates generative priors to drastically reduce bit-rate while maintaining reconstruction fidelity. Specifically, our method compresses high-level semantic representations of the video, then uses a conditional diffusion model to reconstruct frames from these semantics. To further improve compression, we characterize motion information with global camera trajectories and foreground segmentation: background motion is compactly represented by camera pose parameters while foreground dynamics by sparse segmentation masks. This allows for significantly boosts compression efficiency, enabling descent video reconstruction at extremely low bit-rates.

*Md. Mehedi Hassan,Taufiq Hasan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: CAA Ensemble model for ROP screening uses clinical context-aware asymmetric ensemble with structure and vascular specialists to achieve SOTA performance on imbalanced datasets while providing transparent visual explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ROP screening faces challenges due to limited data availability, complex conditions requiring both structural staging and microvascular analysis, and poor generalization of current deep learning models on small, imbalanced public datasets.

Method: Two-stream approach: 1) MS-AQNet as structure specialist using clinical contexts as dynamic query vectors to locate fibrovascular ridge, 2) VascuMIL encoding Vascular Topology Maps with gated MIL to identify vascular tortuosity, plus synergistic meta-learner to ensemble orthogonal signals.

Result: Achieved Macro F1-Score of 0.93 for Broad ROP staging and AUC of 0.996 for Plus Disease detection on imbalanced cohort of 188 infants (6,004 images), with transparent 'Glass Box' explanations via attention heatmaps and vascular threat maps.

Conclusion: Clinical metadata effectively guides visual search, architectural inductive bias bridges medical AI data gap, and transparent ensemble approach simulates clinical reasoning for robust ROP screening.

Abstract: Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is among the major causes of preventable childhood blindness. Automated screening remains challenging, primarily due to limited data availability and the complex condition involving both structural staging and microvascular abnormalities. Current deep learning models depend heavily on large private datasets and passive multimodal fusion, which commonly fail to generalize on small, imbalanced public cohorts. We thus propose the Context-Aware Asymmetric Ensemble Model (CAA Ensemble) that simulates clinical reasoning through two specialized streams. First, the Multi-Scale Active Query Network (MS-AQNet) serves as a structure specialist, utilizing clinical contexts as dynamic query vectors to spatially control visual feature extraction for localization of the fibrovascular ridge. Secondly, VascuMIL encodes Vascular Topology Maps (VMAP) within a gated Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) network to precisely identify vascular tortuosity. A synergistic meta-learner ensembles these orthogonal signals to resolve diagnostic discordance across multiple objectives. Tested on a highly imbalanced cohort of 188 infants (6,004 images), the framework attained State-of-the-Art performance on two distinct clinical tasks: achieving a Macro F1-Score of 0.93 for Broad ROP staging and an AUC of 0.996 for Plus Disease detection. Crucially, the system features `Glass Box' transparency through counterfactual attention heatmaps and vascular threat maps, proving that clinical metadata dictates the model's visual search. Additionally, this study demonstrates that architectural inductive bias can serve as an effective bridge for the medical AI data gap.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A hybrid registration-segmentation framework using cross-modality weak supervision for liver tumour detection, where tumours are visible in MRI but invisible in CT, showing limitations when pathology lacks corresponding visual features in target modality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver tumours are clearly visible on pre-operative MRI but often invisible on intra-operative CT due to minimal contrast between pathological and healthy tissue, creating a clinical challenge for tumour ablation procedures.

Method: A hybrid registration-segmentation framework combining MSCGUNet for inter-modal image registration with a UNet-based segmentation module, enabling registration-assisted pseudo-label generation for CT images using cross-modality weak supervision.

Result: On CHAOS dataset, the pipeline achieved Dice score of 0.72 for healthy liver anatomy registration and segmentation, but performance degraded to Dice score of 0.16 on clinical tumour data, revealing fundamental limitations when pathology lacks corresponding visual features in target modality.

Conclusion: Registration-based label transfer cannot compensate for absence of discriminative features in target modality; segmenting truly invisible pathology remains an open challenge, highlighting important insights for future cross-modality medical image analysis research.

Abstract: Liver tumour ablation presents a significant clinical challenge: whilst tumours are clearly visible on pre-operative MRI, they are often effectively invisible on intra-operative CT due to minimal contrast between pathological and healthy tissue. This work investigates the feasibility of cross-modality weak supervision for scenarios where pathology is visible in one modality (MRI) but absent in another (CT). We present a hybrid registration-segmentation framework that combines MSCGUNet for inter-modal image registration with a UNet-based segmentation module, enabling registration-assisted pseudo-label generation for CT images. Our evaluation on the CHAOS dataset demonstrates that the pipeline can successfully register and segment healthy liver anatomy, achieving a Dice score of 0.72. However, when applied to clinical data containing tumours, performance degrades substantially (Dice score of 0.16), revealing the fundamental limitations of current registration methods when the target pathology lacks corresponding visual features in the target modality. We analyse the "domain gap" and "feature absence" problems, demonstrating that whilst spatial propagation of labels via registration is feasible for visible structures, segmenting truly invisible pathology remains an open challenge. Our findings highlight that registration-based label transfer cannot compensate for the absence of discriminative features in the target modality, providing important insights for future research in cross-modality medical image analysis.

Abstract: This work examines a disc-centric approach for automated severity grading of lumbar spinal stenosis from sagittal T2-weighted MRI. The method combines contrastive pretraining with disc-level fine-tuning, using a single anatomically localized region of interest per intervertebral disc. Contrastive learning is employed to help the model focus on meaningful disc features and reduce sensitivity to irrelevant differences in image appearance. The framework includes an auxiliary regression task for disc localization and applies weighted focal loss to address class imbalance. Experiments demonstrate a 78.1% balanced accuracy and a reduced severe-to-normal misclassification rate of 2.13% compared with supervised training from scratch. Detecting discs with moderate severity can still be challenging, but focusing on disc-level features provides a practical way to assess the lumbar spinal stenosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While carrier phase positioning enables cm-level accuracy in wireless systems and phase-only measurements work well in distributed MIMO, the impact of phase synchronization errors remains insufficiently explored, creating a research gap.

Method: 1) Hyperbola intersection method for accurate positioning under phase synchronization errors when trained on appropriate data, 2) Deep learning-based distributed MIMO antenna point selection framework to ensure high-precision localization under synchronization errors.

Result: The proposed framework improves positioning accuracy compared to prior-art methods while reducing inference complexity by approximately 19.7%.

Conclusion: The DL-based antenna point selection framework effectively addresses phase synchronization error challenges in distributed MIMO carrier phase positioning, achieving both improved accuracy and reduced computational complexity.

Abstract: Carrier phase positioning (CPP) can enable cm-level accuracy in next-generation wireless systems, while recent literature shows that accuracy remains high using phase-only measurements in distributed MIMO (D-MIMO). However, the impact of phase synchronization errors on such systems remains insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we first show that the proposed hyperbola intersection method achieves highly accurate positioning even in the presence of phase synchronization errors, when trained on appropriate data reflecting such impairments. We then introduce a deep learning (DL)-based D-MIMO antenna point (AP) selection framework that ensures high-precision localization under phase synchronization errors. Simulation results show that the proposed framework improves positioning accuracy compared to prior-art methods, while reducing inference complexity by approximately 19.7%.

TL;DR: Proposes an integrated sensing, communication, and control (ISCC) framework for UAV target tracking using stochastic MPC and convex optimization to jointly ensure tracking accuracy, communication reliability, and control stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs in mission-critical applications like target tracking need to simultaneously handle sensing, communication, and control challenges. Current approaches lack a unified framework to jointly guarantee tracking accuracy, communication reliability, and control stability.

Method: 1) Models tracking as discrete-time linear control process; 2) Formulates stochastic MPC optimization for joint control and beamforming; 3) Uses EKF for target state estimation; 4) Derives closed-form optimal beamforming solution; 5) Convexifies non-convex constraints via relaxation-based approximation.

Result: The proposed ISCC framework achieves tracking accuracy comparable to non-causal benchmarks while maintaining stable communication, and significantly outperforms conventional control and tracking methods.

Conclusion: The ISCC framework successfully addresses the joint challenge of ensuring tracking accuracy, communication reliability, and control stability in UAV-assisted target tracking through an integrated optimization approach.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in mission-critical applications such as target tracking, where they must simultaneously sense dynamic environments, ensure reliable communication, and achieve precise control. A key challenge here is to jointly guarantee tracking accuracy, communication reliability, and control stability within a unified framework. To address this issue, we propose an integrated sensing, communication, and control (ISCC) framework for UAV-assisted target tracking, where the considered tracking system is modeled as a discrete-time linear control process, with the objective of driving the deviation between the UAV and target states toward zero. We formulate a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) optimization problem for joint control and beamforming design, which is highly non-convex and intractable in its original form. To overcome this difficulty, the target state is first estimated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Then, by deriving the closed-form optimal beamforming solution under a given control input, the original problem is equivalently reformulated into a tractable control-oriented form. Finally, we convexify the remaining non-convex constraints via a relaxation-based convex approximation, yielding a computationally tractable convex optimization problem that admits efficient global solution. Numerical results show that the proposed ISCC framework achieves tracking accuracy comparable to a non-causal benchmark while maintaining stable communication, and it significantly outperforms the conventional control and tracking method.

TL;DR: A migration-assisted deep learning scheme for reconstructing both shape and permittivity of defects in cylindrical structures using GPR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate reconstruction of both shape and permittivity of defects in cylindrical structures (columns, poles, tree trunks) is challenging due to complex wave scattering and limitations of existing signal processing and deep learning techniques.

Method: Three-stage processing: 1) Dual-permittivity estimation network extracts defect and structure permittivity, 2) Modified Kirchhoff migration maps defect signals using extracted permittivity, 3) Shape reconstruction network processes migrated image to recover defect shape.

Result: Superior performance over existing deep learning methods, validated on synthetic data, laboratory trunk model, and real tree trunk samples. Generalization tests on live trees confirm feasibility for in-field deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed migration-assisted deep learning scheme effectively reconstructs both shape and permittivity of defects in cylindrical structures, with potential application to other circumferential GPR imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has emerged as a prominent tool for imaging internal defects in cylindrical structures, such as columns, utility poles, and tree trunks. However, accurately reconstructing both the shape and permittivity of the defects inside cylindrical structures remains challenging due to complex wave scattering phenomena and the limited accuracy of the existing signal processing and deep learning techniques. To address these issues, this study proposes a migration-assisted deep learning scheme for reconstructing the shape and permittivity of defects within cylindrical structures. The proposed scheme involves three stages of GPR data processing. First, a dual-permittivity estimation network extracts the permittivity values of the defect and the cylindrical structure, the latter of which is estimated with the help of a novel structural similarity index measure-based autofocusing technique. Second, a modified Kirchhoff migration incorporating the extracted permittivity of the cylindrical structure maps the signals reflected from the defect to the imaging domain. Third, a shape reconstruction network processes the migrated image to recover the precise shape of the defect. The image of the interior defect is finally obtained by combining the reconstructed shape and extracted permittivity of the defect. The proposed scheme is validated using both synthetic and experimental data from a laboratory trunk model and real tree trunk samples. Comparative results show superior performance over existing deep learning methods, while generalization tests on live trees confirm its feasibility for in-field deployment. The underlying principle can further be applied to other circumferential GPR imaging scenarios. The code and database are available at: https://github.com/jwqian54/Migration-Assisted-DL.

TL;DR: Proposes UCSFL framework for CF-MIMO networks with two-level aggregation, introduces latency-to-accuracy ratio metric, and jointly optimizes power control, beamforming, model splitting, and AP clustering to minimize this ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support split federated learning in user-centric cell-free MIMO networks by addressing the trade-off between training latency and model accuracy, where AP-cluster size is identified as a key factor influencing convergence performance.

Method: UCSFL framework with local split sub-models at users and complete models at AP-side DPUs, two-level aggregation (DPU and CPU), theoretical convergence analysis, latency-to-accuracy ratio metric, and joint optimization decomposed into short-term (power control, beamforming) and long-term (model splitting, AP clustering) sub-problems.

Result: Convergence analysis reveals AP-cluster size as key factor; UCSFL reduces latency-to-accuracy ratio for VGG16 model compared to baselines; adaptively adjusts strategies based on resources; accelerates VGG16 convergence on MNIST classification.

Conclusion: UCSFL effectively balances latency and accuracy in CF-MIMO networks through joint optimization, demonstrating superior performance and adaptability compared to baseline schemes.

Abstract: This paper proposes a user-centric split federated learning (UCSFL) framework for user-centric cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (CF-MIMO) networks to support split federated learning (SFL). In the proposed UCSFL framework, users deploy split sub-models locally, while complete models are maintained and updated at access point (AP)-side distributed processing units (DPUs), followed by a two-level aggregation procedure across DPUs and the central processing unit (CPU). Under standard machine learning (ML) assumptions, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis for UCSFL, which reveals that the AP-cluster size is a key factor influencing model training accuracy. Motivated by this result, we introduce a new performance metric, termed the latency-to-accuracy ratio, defined as the ratio of a user's per-iteration training latency to the weighted size of its AP cluster. Based on this metric, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the maximum latency-to-accuracy ratio by jointly optimizing uplink power control, downlink beamforming, model splitting, and AP clustering. The resulting problem is decomposed into two sub-problems operating on different time scales, for which dedicated algorithms are developed to handle the short-term and long-term optimizations, respectively. Simulation results verify the convergence of the proposed algorithms and demonstrate that UCSFL effectively reduces the latency-to-accuracy ratio of the VGG16 model compared with baseline schemes. Moreover, the proposed framework adaptively adjusts splitting and clustering strategies in response to varying communication and computation resources. An MNIST-based handwritten digit classification example further shows that UCSFL significantly accelerates the convergence of the VGG16 model.

Result: Transformer-based estimator outperforms other methods and generalizes to new trajectories; iRRT* consistently provides shortest paths to targets in numerical experiments using ray tracing simulations at 28 GHz.

Conclusion: The proposed neural network architecture effectively combines trajectory estimation with optimal path finding for mmWave MIMO outdoor systems, enabling more efficient navigation through accurate localization and path planning.

Abstract: Radio transmissions in millimeter wave (mmWave) bands have gained significant interest for applications demanding precise device localization and trajectory estimation. This paper explores novel neural network (NN) architectures suitable for trajectory estimation and path determination in a mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) outdoor system based on localization data from beamformed fingerprint (BFF). The NN architecture captures sequences of BFF signals from different users, and through the application of learning mechanisms, subsequently estimate their trajectories. In turn, this information is employed to find the shortest path to the target, thereby enabling more efficient navigation. Specifically, we propose a two-stage procedure for trajectory estimation and optimal path finding. In the first stage, a transformer network (TN) based on attention mechanisms is developed to predict trajectories of wireless devices using BFF sequences captured in a mmWave MIMO outdoor system. In the second stage, a novel algorithm based on Informed Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (iRRT*) is employed to determine the optimal path to target locations using trajectory estimates derived in the first stage. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is validated through numerical experiments, using a comprehensive dataset of radio measurements, generated using ray tracing simulations to model outdoor propagation at 28 GHz. We show that our proposed TN-based trajectory estimator outperforms other methods from the recent literature and can successfully generalize to new trajectories outside the training set. Furthermore, our proposed iRRT* algorithm is able to consistently provide the shortest path to the target.

*Yangjin Xu,Wei Gao,Xiaolei Li,Qinghang Zeng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: OCMS-D method enables monoharmonic sound source depth estimation using vertical linear arrays without seabed parameter knowledge by leveraging modal orthogonality and sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth estimation of monoharmonic sound sources at fixed ranges is challenging without seabed environmental parameters, and existing research on this problem is limited.

Method: OCMS-D uses sparsity of propagating normal modes and orthogonality of mode depth functions to first estimate normal mode parameters, then uses both amplitude distribution and sign patterns of estimated mode depth functions at inferred source depth for precise depth estimation.

Result: Yellow Sea experiment: depth estimation errors <2.4m with 4-second time window. SWellEx-96 experiment: errors <5.4m for shallow source and <10.8m for deep source with 10-second time window.

Conclusion: OCMS-D effectively estimates monoharmonic source depth using VLAs without seabed parameter knowledge, validated through numerical simulations and real experiments with good accuracy.

Abstract: Estimating the depth of a monoharmonic sound source at a fixed range using a vertical linear array (VLA) is challenging in the absence of seabed environmental parameters, and relevant research remains scarce. The orthogonality constrained modal search based depth estimation (OCMS-D) method is proposed in this paper, which enables the estimation of the depth of a monoharmonic source at a fixed range using a VLA under unknown seabed parameters. Using the sparsity of propagating normal modes and the orthogonality of mode depth functions, OCMS-D estimates the normal mode parameters under a fixed source-array distance at first. The estimated normal mode parameters are then used to estimate the source depth. To ensure the precision of the source depth estimation, the method utilizes information on both the amplitude distribution and the sign (positive/negative) patterns of the estimated mode depth functions at the inferred source depth. Numerical simulations evaluate the performance of OCMS-D under different conditions. The effectiveness of OCMS-D is also verified by the Yellow Sea experiment and the SWellEx-96 experiment. In the Yellow Sea experiment, the depth estimation absolute errors by OCMS-D with a 4-second time window are less than 2.4 m. And the depth estimation absolute errors in the SWellEx-96 experiment with a 10-second time window are less than 5.4 m for the shallow source and less than 10.8 m for the deep source.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-based antennas and fluid antenna systems face prohibitive CSI acquisition overhead. Radio maps enable proactive mode selection but reconstructing high-fidelity maps from sparse measurements is challenging, as existing methods fail to recover fine-grained shadowing details under extreme sparsity.

Method: Propose Physics-Regularized Low-Rank Tensor Completion (PR-LRTC) framework that models signal field as three-way tensor, integrating environmental low-rankness with deterministic antenna physics. Uses Effective Aerial Degrees-of-Freedom (EADoF) theory to derive differential gain topology map as physical prior for regularization, solved via ADMM-based algorithm.

Conclusion: The proposed PR-LRTC framework successfully addresses radio map reconstruction challenges by integrating physical priors with tensor completion, enabling practical deployment of pixel-based and fluid antenna systems with reduced overhead.

Abstract: The deployment of pixel-based antennas and fluid antenna systems (FAS) is hindered by prohibitive channel state information (CSI) acquisition overhead. While radio maps enable proactive mode selection, reconstructing high-fidelity maps from sparse measurements is challenging. Existing physics-agnostic or data-driven methods often fail to recover fine-grained shadowing details under extreme sparsity. We propose a Physics-Regularized Low-Rank Tensor Completion (PR-LRTC) framework for radio map reconstruction. By modeling the signal field as a three-way tensor, we integrate environmental low-rankness with deterministic antenna physics. Specifically, we leverage Effective Aerial Degrees-of-Freedom (EADoF) theory to derive a differential gain topology map as a physical prior for regularization. The resulting optimization problem is solved via an efficient Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm. Simulations show that PR-LRTC achieves a 4 dB gain over baselines at a 10% sampling ratio. It effectively preserves sharp shadowing edges, providing a robust, physics-compliant solution for low-overhead beam management.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes algorithms for collaborative shape sensing of remote targets in mmWave ISAC systems using both reflection and scattering signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Future wireless systems need integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Millimeter-wave systems offer high sensing accuracy due to large bandwidth, enabling collaborative sensing of remote target shapes using multiple base stations.

Method: 1) Characterize mmWave scattering/reflection using Lambertian model. 2) Use periodogram for rough scattering point detection. 3) Apply subspace method for precise scattering/reflection detection. 4) Design reconstruction algorithm using Hough Transform and PCA for convex polygon targets. 5) Fuse scattering and reflection points to improve accuracy.

Result: Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for remote target shape sensing in mmWave ISAC systems.

Conclusion: The proposed collaborative sensing approach successfully reconstructs target shapes by fusing scattering and reflection signals, demonstrating practical feasibility for mmWave ISAC systems.

Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) is an essential function of future wireless systems. Due to its large available bandwidth, millimeter-wave (mmWave) ISAC systems are able to achieve high sensing accuracy. In this paper, we consider the multiple base-station (BS) collaborative sensing problem in a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) mmWave communication system. Our aim is to sense a remote target shape with the collected signals which consist of both the reflection and scattering signals. We first characterize the mmWave's scattering and reflection effects based on the Lambertian scattering model. Then we apply the periodogram technique to obtain rough scattering point detection, and further incorporate the subspace method to achieve more precise scattering and reflection point detection. Based on these, a reconstruction algorithm based on Hough Transform and principal component analysis (PCA) is designed for a single convex polygon target scenario. To improve the accuracy and completeness of the reconstruction results, we propose a method to further fuse the scattering and reflection points. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

### [123] [Sound Field Estimation Using Optimal Transport Barycenters in the Presence of Phase Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05715)
*Yuyang Liu,Johan Karlsson,Filip Elvander*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes optimal transport framework for sound field reconstruction with phase perturbations, using lifted measures and barycenter estimation to handle sensor calibration errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in sound field reconstruction caused by systematic phase perturbations from sensor mis-calibration (position/response uncertainties), which traditional methods handle poorly with biased estimates or non-convex solutions.

Method: Uses optimal transport framework operating on lifted non-negative measures representing observation-dependent shifted coefficients. Transports measure supports toward barycenter in phase space, adds constant to ground cost for sparsity, and maintains convex consistency.

Result: Simulation results show more accurate coefficient estimations compared to baseline approaches in scenarios with both additive noise and phase perturbations.

Conclusion: The optimal transport framework effectively handles phase perturbation challenges in sound field reconstruction, providing robust and accurate plane-wave coefficient estimation despite sensor calibration errors.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach for estimating plane-wave coefficients in sound field reconstruction, specifically addressing challenges posed by error-in-variable phase perturbations. Such systematic errors typically arise from sensor mis-calibration, including uncertainties in sensor positions and response characteristics, leading to measurement-induced phase shifts in plane wave coefficients. Traditional methods often result in biased estimates or non-convex solutions. To overcome these issues, we propose an optimal transport (OT) framework. This framework operates on a set of lifted non-negative measures that correspond to observation-dependent shifted coefficients relative to the unperturbed ones. By applying OT, the supports of the measures are transported toward an optimal average in the phase space, effectively morphing them into an indistinguishable state. This optimal average, known as barycenter, is linked to the estimated plane-wave coefficients using the same lifting rule. The framework addresses the ill-posed nature of the problem, due to the large number of plane waves, by adding a constant to the ground cost, ensuring the sparsity of the transport matrix. Convex consistency of the solution is maintained. Simulation results confirm that our proposed method provides more accurate coefficient estimations compared to baseline approaches in scenarios with both additive noise and phase perturbations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for consistent uplink/downlink channel reciprocity in repeater-assisted MIMO systems, requiring accurate calibration methods that balance computational complexity with estimation accuracy.

Method: Bayesian MMSE framework incorporating statistical knowledge of signal model, noise, and prior distributions. Uses von Mises denoiser to exploit circular nature of phase parameters for enhanced phase alignment accuracy.

Result: Substantially improved estimation accuracy compared to conventional deterministic NLS methods, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. Exhibits remarkably fast convergence suitable for practical implementation.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian reciprocity calibration method effectively addresses the reciprocity calibration problem in MIMO repeaters, achieving superior accuracy with practical computational requirements and fast convergence.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Bayesian reciprocity calibration method that consistently ensures uplink and downlink channel reciprocity in repeater-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed algorithm is formulated under the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion. Its Bayesian framework incorporates complete statistical knowledge of the signal model, noise, and prior distributions, enabling a coherent design that achieves both low computational complexity and high calibration accuracy. To further enhance phase alignment accuracy, which is critical for calibration tasks, we develop a von Mises denoiser that exploits the fact that the target parameters lie on the circle in the complex plane. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MMSE algorithm achieves substantially improved estimation accuracy compared with conventional deterministic non-linear least-squares (NLS) methods, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits remarkably fast convergence, making it well suited for practical implementation.

TL;DR: A novel low-rank tensor completion method that incorporates discrete alphabet constraints via ℓ₀-norm regularization approximated through fractional programming, outperforming conventional approaches in NMSE and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world tensor completion problems involve discrete-valued entries (e.g., RGB values in images), but conventional low-rank tensor completion methods don't account for this discreteness, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Extends nuclear norm minimization-based tensor completion by adding a discrete-aware ℓ₀-norm regularizer, approximated via a continuous differentiable function using fractional programming, solved under a proximal gradient framework.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in both normalized mean square error (NMSE) and convergence compared to state-of-the-art techniques including NN minimization and matrix factorization approaches.

Conclusion: Incorporating discrete alphabet constraints through ℓ₀-norm regularization significantly improves tensor completion performance for problems with discrete-valued entries, offering a promising approach for applications like image processing.

Abstract: We consider a novel algorithm, for the completion of partially observed low-rank tensors, where each entry of the tensor can be chosen from a discrete finite alphabet set, such as in common image processing problems, where the entries represent the RGB values. The proposed low-rank tensor completion (TC) method builds on the conventional nuclear norm (NN) minimization-based low-rank TC paradigm, through the addition of a discrete-aware regularizer, which enforces discreteness in the objective of the problem, by an $\ell_0$-norm regularizer that is approximated by a continuous and differentiable function normalized via fractional programming (FP) under a proximal gradient (PG) framework, in order to solve the proposed problem. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the new method both in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and convergence, compared to the conventional state of-the-art (SotA) techniques, including NN minimization approaches, as well as a mixture of the latter with a matrix factorization approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR point clouds captured in rain or snow are corrupted by weather-induced returns that degrade perception and safety-critical scene understanding, requiring effective filtering methods.

Method: Intensity- and Distance-Aware Statistical Outlier Removal (IDSOR) jointly exploits intensity cues and neighborhood sparsity with range-dependent distribution of weather returns in threshold design. A variant uses estimated weather return distribution from data.

Result: IDSOR achieves favorable precision-recall trade-off, maintaining both precision and recall above 90% on the Winter Adverse Driving dataset (WADS), and performs well on simulation-augmented level-crossing measurements.

Conclusion: IDSOR effectively suppresses weather-induced LiDAR points while preserving fine structural details without cumbersome manual parameter tuning, demonstrating robust performance in adverse weather conditions.

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds captured in rain or snow are often corrupted by weather-induced returns, which can degrade perception and safety-critical scene understanding. This paper proposes Intensity- and Distance-Aware Statistical Outlier Removal (IDSOR), a range-adaptive filtering method that jointly exploits intensity cues and neighborhood sparsity. By incorporating an empirical, range-dependent distribution of weather returns into the threshold design, IDSOR suppresses weather-induced points while preserving fine structural details without cumbersome manual parameter tuning. We also propose a variant that uses a previously proposed method to estimate the weather return distribution from data, and integrates it into IDSOR. Experiments on simulation-augmented level-crossing measurements and on the Winter Adverse Driving dataset (WADS) demonstrate that IDSOR achieves a favorable precision-recall trade-off, maintaining both precision and recall above 90% on WADS.

### [127] [Correcting Contextual Deletions in DNA Nanopore Readouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05072)
*Yuan-Pon Chen,Olgica Milenkovic,João Ribeiro,Jin Sima*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Study of contextual deletion errors in DNA storage with nanopore sequencers, focusing on deterministic deletions after runlengths ≥ k. Two regimes: k = C log n (construct efficient codes) and constant k (extremal channel analysis).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nanopore sequencing errors in DNA storage are contextual, not independent. Existing models assume independent deletions, which doesn't match practical nanopore error patterns where deletions occur in specific sequence contexts.

Method: Model contextual deletions as deterministic single deletions following runlengths of length ≥ k. Analyze two regimes: 1) k = C log n: study error-correcting codes for constant t deletions, derive redundancy bounds, construct efficient codes; 2) constant k: analyze extremal contextual deletion channel where deletions occur after every run ≥ k.

Result: For k = C log n: redundancy bounds between (1-C)t log n and 2(1-C)t log n; construct efficient codes for constant t, with t=1 and C>1/2 achieving near-optimal redundancy. For constant k: obtain sharp bounds on maximum achievable rate under extremal contextual deletion channel.

Conclusion: Contextual deletion models better capture nanopore error patterns. The work provides theoretical foundations and practical code constructions for DNA storage systems, showing contextual deletions require less redundancy than arbitrary deletions.

Abstract: The problem of designing codes for deletion-correction and synchronization has received renewed interest due to applications in DNA-based data storage systems that use nanopore sequencers as readout platforms. In almost all instances, deletions are assumed to be imposed independently of each other and of the sequence context. These assumptions are not valid in practice, since nanopore errors tend to occur within specific contexts. We study contextual nanopore deletion-errors through the example setting of deterministic single deletions following (complete) runlengths of length at least $k$. The model critically depends on the runlength threshold $k$, and we examine two regimes for $k$: a) $k=C\log n$ for a constant $C\in(0,1)$; in this case, we study error-correcting codes that can protect from a constant number $t$ of contextual deletions, and show that the minimum redundancy (ignoring lower-order terms) is between $(1-C)t\log n$ and $2(1-C)t\log n$, meaning that it is a ($1-C$)-fraction of that of arbitrary $t$-deletion-correcting codes. To complement our non-constructive redundancy upper bound, we design efficiently and encodable and decodable codes for any constant $t$. In particular, for $t=1$ and $C>1/2$ we construct efficient codes with redundancy that essentially matches our non-constructive upper bound; b) $k$ equal a constant; in this case we consider the extremal problem where the number of deletions is not bounded and a deletion is imposed after every run of length at least $k$, which we call the extremal contextual deletion channel. This combinatorial setting arises naturally by considering a probabilistic channel that introduces contextual deletions after each run of length at least $k$ with probability $p$ and taking the limit $p\to 1$. We obtain sharp bounds on the maximum achievable rate under the extremal contextual deletion channel for arbitrary constant $k$.

Conclusion: The approach significantly expands the range of constructible QC/GQC codes by moving beyond elliptic curves to Kummer extensions, providing explicit parameter formulas and flexible co-index options.

Abstract: We present new constructions of quasi-cyclic (QC) and generalized quasi-cyclic (GQC) codes from algebraic curves.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G requires massive real-world channel datasets for AI and ISAC, but traditional frequency-domain channel sounding is inefficient due to the need for many frequency points to avoid delay ambiguity.

Method: Proposes Parabolic Frequency Sampling (PFS) strategy for nonuniform frequency distribution to eliminate delay ambiguity with reduced sampling, and LR-SAGE algorithm to extract multipath components while rectifying likelihood distortion from nonuniform sampling and molecular absorption.

Result: Achieves 50× faster measurement, 98% reduction in data volume, and 99.96% reduction in post-processing computational complexity while capturing MPCs and channel characteristics consistent with traditional exhaustive measurements at 280-300 GHz.

Conclusion: The framework enables acquisition of massive channel datasets needed for AI scaling laws in 6G, serving as a fundamental enabler for constructing AI-native 6G ISAC datasets.

Abstract: Realizing the 6G vision of artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) critically requires large-scale real-world channel datasets for channel modeling and data-driven AI models. However, traditional frequency-domain channel sounding methods suffer from low efficiency due to a prohibitive number of frequency points to avoid delay ambiguity. This paper proposes a novel channel sounding framework involving sparse nonuniform sampling along with a likelihood-rectified space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (LR-SAGE) algorithm for multipath component extraction. This framework enables the acquisition of channel datasets that are tens or even hundreds of times larger within the same channel measurement duration, thereby providing the massive data required to harness the full potential of AI scaling laws. Specifically, we propose a Parabolic Frequency Sampling (PFS) strategy that non-uniformly distributes frequency points, effectively eliminating delay ambiguity while reducing sampling overhead by orders of magnitude. To efficiently extract multipath components (MPCs) from the channel data measured by PFS, we develop a LR-SAGE algorithm, rectifying the likelihood distortion caused by nonuniform sampling and molecular absorption effect. Simulation results and experimental validation at 280--300~GHz confirm that the proposed PFS and LR-SAGE algorithm not only achieve 50$\times$ faster measurement, a 98\% reduction in data volume and a 99.96\% reduction in post-processing computational complexity, but also successfully captures MPCs and channel characteristics consistent with traditional exhaustive measurements, demonstrating its potential as a fundamental enabler for constructing the massive ISAC datasets required by AI-native 6G systems.

TL;DR: Constructs explicit family of F_h-linear sum-rank metric codes with efficient list decoding up to fraction ρ of errors with rate 1-ρ-ε, and extends to folded Linearized Reed-Solomon codes for first positive-rate list decodable codes beyond unique-decoding radius.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sum-rank metric has applications in network coding, locally repairable codes, space-time coding, and quantum-resistant cryptography. Need for efficient list decodable codes in sum-rank metric beyond unique-decoding radius.

Method: Construct subcodes of Linearized Reed-Solomon (LRS) codes by restricting message polynomials to F_h-subspace derived from subspace designs. Extend to folded LRS codes using linear-algebraic decoding framework with interpolation conditions and structured affine subspace analysis.

Result: Achieves list decoding up to fraction ρ of errors with rate 1-ρ-ε for any ρ∈(0,1) and ε>0. Decoding list size bounded by h^poly(1/ε). First explicit positive-rate FLRS subcodes efficiently list decodable beyond unique-decoding radius.

Conclusion: Provides new general framework for constructing efficiently decodable codes under sum-rank metric, with first explicit construction of positive-rate sum-rank metric codes admitting efficient list decoding beyond unique decoding radius.

Abstract: The sum-rank metric is the mixture of the Hamming and rank metrics. The sum-rank metric found its application in network coding, locally repairable codes, space-time coding, and quantum-resistant cryptography. Linearized Reed-Solomon (LRS) codes are the sum-rank analogue of Reed-Solomon codes and strictly generalize both Reed-Solomon and Gabidulin codes.
  In this work, we construct an explicit family of $\mathbb{F}_h$-linear sum-rank metric codes over arbitrary fields $\mathbb{F}_h$. Our construction enables efficient list decoding up to a fraction $ρ$ of errors in the sum-rank metric with rate $1-ρ-\varepsilon$, for any desired $ρ\in (0,1)$ and $\varepsilon>0$. Our codes are subcodes of LRS codes, obtained by restricting message polynomials to an $\mathbb{F}_h$-subspace derived from subspace designs, and the decoding list size is bounded by $h^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}$.
  Beyond the standard LRS setting, we further extend our linear-algebraic decoding framework to folded Linearized Reed-Solomon (FLRS) codes. We show that folded evaluations satisfy appropriate interpolation conditions and that the corresponding solution space forms a low-dimensional, structured affine subspace. This structure enables effective control of the list size and yields the first explicit positive-rate FLRS subcodes that are efficiently list decodable beyond the unique-decoding radius. To the best of our knowledge, this also constitutes the first explicit construction of positive-rate sum-rank metric codes that admit efficient list decoding beyond the unique decoding radius, thereby providing a new general framework for constructing efficiently decodable codes under the sum-rank metric.

*Chao Zhou,Changsheng You,Cong Zhou,Li Chen,Yi Gong,Chengwen Xing*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes low-complexity FT-based beam coverage design for multi-antenna systems in both far-field and near-field scenarios, achieving comparable performance to sampling-based methods with significantly reduced complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling-based optimization methods for beam coverage design have high computational complexity. Need efficient low-complexity alternatives for practical multi-antenna systems in both far-field and near-field cases.

Method: Formulates beam coverage as spatial-frequency filtering problem. For far-field: uses inverse FT with weight-shaping in antenna domain, proposes roll-off-aware design with protective zoom to address finite-antenna truncation effects. For near-field: applies first-order Taylor approximation to CSV, transforms 2D coverage design into 2D inverse FT.

Result: Proposed FT-based approach achieves comparable worst-case beamforming performance to conventional sampling-based optimization methods while significantly reducing computational complexity. Near-field analysis reveals inherent range defocusing effect where wide angular coverage leads to range-insensitive beam steering.

Conclusion: The FT-based beam coverage design provides an efficient low-complexity alternative to sampling-based methods for both far-field and near-field multi-antenna systems, with practical solutions to address finite-antenna limitations and near-field effects.

Abstract: In this paper, we study efficient beam coverage design for multi-antenna systems in both far-field and near-field cases. To reduce the computational complexity of existing sampling-based optimization methods, we propose a new low-complexity yet efficient beam coverage design. To this end, we first formulate a general beam coverage optimization problem to maximize the worst-case beamforming gain over a target region. For the far-field case, we show that the beam coverage design can be viewed as a spatial-frequency filtering problem, where angular coverage can be achieved by weight-shaping in the antenna domain via an inverse FT, yielding an infinite-length weighting sequence. Under the constraint of a finite number of antennas, a surrogate scheme is proposed by directly truncating this sequence, which inevitably introduces a roll-off effect at the angular boundaries, yielding degraded worst-case beamforming gain. To address this issue, we characterize the finite-antenna-induced roll-off effect, based on which a roll-off-aware design with a protective zoom is developed to ensure a flat beamforming-gain profile within the target angular region. Next, we extend the proposed method to the near-field case. Specifically, by applying a first-order Taylor approximation to the near-field channel steering vector (CSV), the two-dimensional (2D) beam coverage design (in both angle and inverse-range) can be transformed into a 2D inverse FT, leading to a low-complexity beamforming design. Furthermore, an inherent near-field range defocusing effect is observed, indicating that sufficiently wide angular coverage results in range-insensitive beam steering. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FT-based approach achieves a comparable worst-case beamforming performance with that of conventional sampling-based optimization methods while significantly reducing the computational complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by applications to probabilistic prediction with Tsallis losses and online learning, where controlling divergences is important but needs to be converted to L1-norm control for practical applications.

Method: The authors prove a generalized Pinsker inequality for Bregman divergences Dα generated by negative α-Tsallis entropies. They establish sharp bounds and determine the optimal constant Cα,K explicitly for every choice of (α,K) for probability distributions p,q in the relative interior of the probability simplex Δ^K.

Result: Proved the sharp inequality Dα(p∥q) ≥ (Cα,K/2)·∥p-q∥₁² for all p,q in the relative interior of Δ^K, and determined the optimal constant Cα,K explicitly for every (α,K) combination.

Conclusion: The paper provides a complete generalization of the classical Pinsker inequality to Bregman divergences from Tsallis entropies, with explicit optimal constants that enable practical conversion of divergence control to L1-norm control for applications in probabilistic prediction and online learning.

Abstract: The Pinsker inequality lower bounds the Kullback--Leibler divergence $D_{\textrm{KL}}$ in terms of total variation and provides a canonical way to convert $D_{\textrm{KL}}$ control into $\lVert \cdot \rVert_1$-control. Motivated by applications to probabilistic prediction with Tsallis losses and online learning, we establish a generalized Pinsker inequality for the Bregman divergences $D_α$ generated by the negative $α$-Tsallis entropies -- also known as $β$-divergences. Specifically, for any $p$, $q$ in the relative interior of the probability simplex $Δ^K$, we prove the sharp bound \[
  D_α(p\Vert q) \ge \frac{C_{α,K}}{2}\cdot \|p-q\|_1^2, \] and we determine the optimal constant $C_{α,K}$ explicitly for every choice of $(α,K)$.

*Ravi Sharan Bhagavathula,Pavan Koteshwar Srinath,Alvaro Valcarce Rial,Baltasar-Beferull Lozano*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes a weighted proportional fair-based heuristic algorithm for uplink MU-MIMO scheduling in XR applications that maximizes timely throughput while satisfying user PAoI constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extended reality (XR) applications require timely data delivery with strict latency requirements. Existing scheduling approaches don't adequately address the cross-layer timely throughput maximization problem while considering user satisfaction through PAoI constraints in uplink MU-MIMO systems.

Method: Develops a signaling-free, weighted proportional fair-based iterative heuristic algorithm where weights are derived from the PAoI metric. The approach addresses the NP-hard cross-layer optimization problem by incorporating PAoI constraints into the scheduling framework.

Result: The proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of XR capacity without sacrificing overall system throughput, as demonstrated through extensive numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The weighted proportional fair-based heuristic with PAoI-derived weights provides an effective solution for timely throughput maximization in XR applications over uplink MU-MIMO systems, balancing user satisfaction with system performance.

Abstract: In this work, we study the cross-layer timely throughput maximization for extended reality (XR) applications through uplink multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) scheduling. Timely scheduling opportunities are characterized by the peak age of information (PAoI)-metric and are incorporated into a network-side optimization problem as constraints modeling user satisfaction. The problem being NP-hard, we resort to a signaling-free, weighted proportional fair-based iterative heuristic algorithm, where the weights are derived with respect to the PAoI metric. Extensive numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of XR capacity without sacrificing the overall system throughput.

### [134] [Price of universality in vector quantization is at most 0.11 bit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05790)
*Alina Harbuzova,Or Ordentlich,Yury Polyanskiy*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proves existence of a universal codebook for weight-only quantization that is simultaneously near-optimal for all possible input statistics, requiring only 0.11 extra bits per dimension compared to optimal statistics-adapted codebooks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weight-only quantization (using low-precision approximations of weight matrices) is crucial for efficient LLM deployment, but optimal quantization depends on input statistics, which is impractical to adapt to in real-world scenarios.

Method: Theoretical proof establishing existence of a universal codebook that works well for all possible input statistics, showing it can match the performance of optimal statistics-adapted codebooks with only 0.11 extra bits per dimension.

Result: Existence proof of a universal codebook that is simultaneously near-optimal for all possible statistics of X, equivalent to finding a net in ℝⁿ that provides nearly-optimal covering of a sphere for all Hilbert norms.

Conclusion: While the existence proof is non-constructive, it demonstrates the theoretical possibility of a universal low-precision storage format that would be ideal for practical LLM deployment, though finding explicit constructions remains an open problem.

Abstract: Fast computation of a matrix product $W^\top X$ is a workhorse of modern LLMs. To make their deployment more efficient, a popular approach is that of using a low-precision approximation $\widehat W$ in place of true $W$ ("weight-only quantization''). Information theory demonstrates that an optimal algorithm for reducing precision of $W$ depends on the (second order) statistics of $X$ and requires a careful alignment of vector quantization codebook with PCA directions of $X$ (a process known as "waterfilling allocation''). Dependence of the codebook on statistics of $X$, however, is highly impractical. This paper proves that there exist a universal codebook that is simultaneously near-optimal for all possible statistics of $X$, in the sense of being at least as good as an $X$-adapted waterfilling codebook with rate reduced by 0.11 bit per dimension. Such universal codebook would be an ideal candidate for the low-precision storage format, a topic of active modern research, but alas the existence proof is non-constructive.
  Equivalently, our result shows existence of a net in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is a nearly-optimal covering of a sphere simultaneously with respect to all Hilbert norms.

### [135] [Signal or 'Noise': Human Reactions to Robot Errors in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05010)
*Maia Stiber,Sameer Khan,Russell Taylor,Chien-Ming Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Social signals from people in response to robot errors are rich but noisy in real-world settings, particularly during group interactions with error propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Little is known about people's social responses to robot errors outside lab settings, especially with non-social robots in repeated group interactions where errors can propagate.

Method: Built a coffee robot and conducted a public field deployment with 49 participants to observe social responses to errors in real-world HRI.

Result: Participants consistently expressed varied social signals in response to errors, particularly during group interactions. Social signals were rich (people volunteered interaction information) but "noisy."

Conclusion: Social signals in real-world HRI are valuable for error management but present challenges due to their noisy nature, especially in group settings with error propagation.

Abstract: In the real world, robots frequently make errors, yet little is known about people's social responses to errors outside of lab settings. Prior work has shown that social signals are reliable and useful for error management in constrained interactions, but it is unclear if this holds in the real world - especially with a non-social robot in repeated and group interactions with successive or propagated errors. To explore this, we built a coffee robot and conducted a public field deployment ($N = 49$). We found that participants consistently expressed varied social signals in response to errors and other stimuli, particularly during group interactions. Our findings suggest that social signals in the wild are rich (with participants volunteering information about the interaction), but "noisy." We discuss lessons, benefits, and challenges for using social signals in real-world HRI.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A differentiable neuro-graphics model combines neural foundation models with physics-based differentiable rendering for zero-shot scene reconstruction and robot grasping from single RGBD images without additional 3D data or test-time samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need to operate in novel environments with unseen objects, but current methods require large training datasets and test-time sampling. The authors aim to create a more data-efficient, interpretable, and generalizable approach for robot autonomy in new environments.

Method: The model combines neural foundation models with physics-based differentiable rendering to solve constrained optimization problems. It estimates physically consistent scene parameters (meshes, lighting, material properties, 6D poses) from a single RGBD image and bounding boxes without additional 3D data.

Result: The approach outperforms existing algorithms on standard model-free few-shot pose estimation benchmarks. It also successfully enables zero-shot grasping tasks, validating the accuracy of scene reconstructions.

Conclusion: The differentiable neuro-graphics model enables zero-shot, physically-consistent scene reconstruction and grasping without extensive datasets or test-time sampling, offering a pathway toward more data-efficient, interpretable, and generalizable robot autonomy in novel environments.

Abstract: Operating effectively in novel real-world environments requires robotic systems to estimate and interact with previously unseen objects. Current state-of-the-art models address this challenge by using large amounts of training data and test-time samples to build black-box scene representations. In this work, we introduce a differentiable neuro-graphics model that combines neural foundation models with physics-based differentiable rendering to perform zero-shot scene reconstruction and robot grasping without relying on any additional 3D data or test-time samples. Our model solves a series of constrained optimization problems to estimate physically consistent scene parameters, such as meshes, lighting conditions, material properties, and 6D poses of previously unseen objects from a single RGBD image and bounding boxes. We evaluated our approach on standard model-free few-shot benchmarks and demonstrated that it outperforms existing algorithms for model-free few-shot pose estimation. Furthermore, we validated the accuracy of our scene reconstructions by applying our algorithm to a zero-shot grasping task. By enabling zero-shot, physically-consistent scene reconstruction and grasping without reliance on extensive datasets or test-time sampling, our approach offers a pathway towards more data efficient, interpretable and generalizable robot autonomy in novel environments.

*Vinal Asodia,Iman Sharifi,Saber Fallah*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Neuro-symbolic RL pipeline for autonomous driving combining semantic/spatial scene context with soft logic-based reward functions improves safety and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera-based RL approaches lack high-level scene context integration and rely on rigid, fixed reward functions, limiting their ability to make context-aware and value-aligned decisions in autonomous driving.

Method: Proposes neuro-symbolic feature representation combining semantic, spatial, and shape information with spatially boosted dynamic entity features, plus Soft First-Order Logic (SFOL) reward function that uses symbolic reasoning to balance human values via linguistic rules applied to segmentation map predicates.

Result: Quantitative experiments in CARLA simulation show improved policy robustness and safety metrics compared to baselines across varying traffic densities and occlusion levels.

Conclusion: Integrating holistic neuro-symbolic representations and soft reasoning into RL enables more context-aware and value-aligned decision-making for autonomous driving.

Abstract: The problem with existing camera-based Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches is twofold: they rarely integrate high-level scene context into the feature representation, and they rely on rigid, fixed reward functions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel pipeline that produces a neuro-symbolic feature representation that encompasses semantic, spatial, and shape information, as well as spatially boosted features of dynamic entities in the scene, with an emphasis on safety-critical road users. It also proposes a Soft First-Order Logic (SFOL) reward function that balances human values via a symbolic reasoning module. Here, semantic and spatial predicates are extracted from segmentation maps and applied to linguistic rules to obtain reward weights. Quantitative experiments in the CARLA simulation environment show that the proposed neuro-symbolic representation and SFOL reward function improved policy robustness and safety-related performance metrics compared to baseline representations and reward formulations across varying traffic densities and occlusion levels. The findings demonstrate that integrating holistic representations and soft reasoning into Reinforcement Learning can support more context-aware and value-aligned decision-making for autonomous driving.

*Thomas Cohn,Lihan Tang,Alexandre Amice,Russ Tedrake*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: New IK formulation using analytic solution as change of variables makes optimization easier, achieving higher success rates across challenging IK problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IK methods have complementary strengths: analytic methods are fast but limited, optimization methods handle constraints but struggle with nonlinear relationships. Need unified approach leveraging both.

Method: Propose new optimization IK formulation using analytic IK solution as change of variables, simplifying the optimization problem. Tested on three popular solvers representing different constrained nonlinear optimization paradigms.

Result: Extensive experiments show new formulation achieves higher success rates than old formulation and baseline methods across various challenging IK problems including collision avoidance, grasp selection, and humanoid stability.

Conclusion: The analytic-solution-as-change-of-variables approach successfully unifies analytic and optimization IK methods, making optimization fundamentally easier to solve while maintaining constraint-handling capabilities.

Abstract: Analytic and optimization methods for solving inverse kinematics (IK) problems have been deeply studied throughout the history of robotics. The two strategies have complementary strengths and weaknesses, but developing a unified approach to take advantage of both methods has proved challenging. A key challenge faced by optimization approaches is the complicated nonlinear relationship between the joint angles and the end-effector pose. When this must be handled concurrently with additional nonconvex constraints like collision avoidance, optimization IK algorithms may suffer high failure rates. We present a new formulation for optimization IK that uses an analytic IK solution as a change of variables, and is fundamentally easier for optimizers to solve. We test our methodology on three popular solvers, representing three different paradigms for constrained nonlinear optimization. Extensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that our new formulation achieves higher success rates than the old formulation and baseline methods across various challenging IK problems, including collision avoidance, grasp selection, and humanoid stability.

### [140] [Informative Path Planning with Guaranteed Estimation Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05198)
*Kalvik Jakkala,Saurav Agarwal,Jason O'Kane,Srinivas Akella*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Bridging lawnmower surveys and informative path planning by computing shortest paths that guarantee Gaussian-process posterior variance falls below specified thresholds for environmental monitoring robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Environmental monitoring robots need to reconstruct spatial fields under tight constraints. Classical lawnmower surveys waste effort oversampling predictable regions, while informative path planning lacks guarantees on reconstruction quality. There's a need for approaches that combine efficiency with quality guarantees.

Method: Three-stage approach: (1) learn GP model from prior information, (2) transform learned GP kernel into binary coverage maps indicating which locations' uncertainty can be reduced below target, (3) plan near-shortest route whose combined coverage satisfies global uncertainty constraint. Incorporates nonstationary kernels for heterogeneous phenomena and handles non-convex environments with obstacles.

Result: Experiments on real-world topographic data show planners meet uncertainty targets using fewer sensing locations and shorter travel distances than baseline. Field experiments with bathymetry-mapping autonomous surface and underwater vehicles demonstrate real-world feasibility.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges lawnmower surveys and informative path planning by providing guaranteed estimation uncertainty while maintaining efficiency, with provable approximation guarantees and demonstrated real-world applicability.

Abstract: Environmental monitoring robots often need to reconstruct spatial fields (e.g., salinity, temperature, bathymetry) under tight distance and energy constraints. Classical boustrophedon lawnmower surveys provide geometric coverage guarantees but can waste effort by oversampling predictable regions. In contrast, informative path planning (IPP) methods leverage spatial correlations to reduce oversampling, yet typically offer no guarantees on reconstruction quality. This paper bridges these approaches by addressing informative path planning with guaranteed estimation uncertainty: computing the shortest path whose measurements ensure that the Gaussian-process (GP) posterior variance -- an intrinsic uncertainty measure that lower-bounds the mean-squared prediction error under the GP model -- falls below a user-specified threshold over the monitoring region.
  We propose a three-stage approach: (i) learn a GP model from available prior information; (ii) transform the learned GP kernel into binary coverage maps for each candidate sensing location, indicating which locations' uncertainty can be reduced below a specified target; and (iii) plan a near-shortest route whose combined coverage satisfies the global uncertainty constraint. To address heterogeneous phenomena, we incorporate a nonstationary kernel that captures spatially varying correlation structure, and we accommodate non-convex environments with obstacles. Algorithmically, we present methods with provable approximation guarantees for sensing-location selection and for the joint selection-and-routing problem under a travel budget. Experiments on real-world topographic data show that our planners meet the uncertainty target using fewer sensing locations and shorter travel distances than a recent baseline, and field experiments with bathymetry-mapping autonomous surface and underwater vehicles demonstrate real-world feasibility.

TL;DR: A minimal-sensing approach for autonomous underwater robots to navigate submerged pipelines using only IMU, pressure sensor, and two sonars, achieving stable centering and traversal without complex sensor arrays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous underwater inspection of submerged pipelines is difficult due to confined spaces, poor visibility (turbidity), and lack of reliable localization cues. Existing solutions often require expensive/complex sensor arrays.

Method: Uses IMU, pressure sensor, downward-facing single-beam sonar, and rotating 360° sonar. Develops efficient method to extract range estimates from sonar intensity data. Uses geometric model with two sonar ranges to estimate pipe center. Implements adaptive confidence-weighted PD controller for alignment.

Result: Successfully demonstrated stable centering and full-pipe traversal in submerged 46 cm-diameter pipe using BlueROV2, despite ambient flow and structural deformations. No DVL, external tracking, or complex arrays needed.

Conclusion: Reliable in-pipe navigation can be achieved with lightweight, computationally efficient sensing architecture, advancing practicality of autonomous underwater inspection in confined environments.

Abstract: Autonomous underwater inspection of submerged pipelines is challenging due to confined geometries, turbidity, and the scarcity of reliable localization cues. This paper presents a minimal-sensing strategy that enables a free-swimming underwater robot to center itself and traverse a flooded pipe of known radius using only an IMU, a pressure sensor, and two sonars: a downward-facing single-beam sonar and a rotating 360 degree sonar. We introduce a computationally efficient method for extracting range estimates from single-beam sonar intensity data, enabling reliable wall detection in noisy and reverberant conditions. A closed-form geometric model leverages the two sonar ranges to estimate the pipe center, and an adaptive, confidence-weighted proportional-derivative (PD) controller maintains alignment during traversal. The system requires no Doppler velocity log, external tracking, or complex multi-sensor arrays. Experiments in a submerged 46 cm-diameter pipe using a Blue Robotics BlueROV2 heavy remotely operated vehicle demonstrate stable centering and successful full-pipe traversal despite ambient flow and structural deformations. These results show that reliable in-pipe navigation and inspection can be achieved with a lightweight, computationally efficient sensing and processing architecture, advancing the practicality of autonomous underwater inspection in confined environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM-based methods struggle with ambiguous human instructions in unfamiliar environments due to inefficient reasoning and lack of environmental interaction, hindering real-time task planning and execution.

Method: AIDE uses a dual-stream framework: Multi-Stage Inference (MSI) for decision-making and Accelerated Decision-Making (ADM) for execution, enabling zero-shot affordance analysis and interpretation of ambiguous instructions through interactive exploration with vision-language reasoning.

Result: AIDE achieves over 80% task planning success rate and more than 95% accuracy in closed-loop continuous execution at 10 Hz, outperforming existing VLM-based methods in diverse open-world scenarios.

Conclusion: AIDE effectively addresses the challenge of ambiguous human instructions in robotics by combining interactive exploration with vision-language reasoning, enabling robust real-time task execution in unfamiliar environments.

Abstract: Enabling robots to explore and act in unfamiliar environments under ambiguous human instructions by interactively identifying task-relevant objects (e.g., identifying cups or beverages for "I'm thirsty") remains challenging for existing vision-language model (VLM)-based methods. This challenge stems from inefficient reasoning and the lack of environmental interaction, which hinder real-time task planning and execution. To address this, We propose Affordance-Aware Interactive Decision-Making and Execution for Ambiguous Instructions (AIDE), a dual-stream framework that integrates interactive exploration with vision-language reasoning, where Multi-Stage Inference (MSI) serves as the decision-making stream and Accelerated Decision-Making (ADM) as the execution stream, enabling zero-shot affordance analysis and interpretation of ambiguous instructions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments show that AIDE achieves the task planning success rate of over 80\% and more than 95\% accuracy in closed-loop continuous execution at 10 Hz, outperforming existing VLM-based methods in diverse open-world scenarios.

Abstract: Soccer presents a significant challenge for humanoid robots, demanding tightly integrated perception-action capabilities for tasks like perception-guided kicking and whole-body balance control. Existing approaches suffer from inter-module instability in modular pipelines or conflicting training objectives in end-to-end frameworks. We propose Perception-Action integrated Decision-making (PAiD), a progressive architecture that decomposes soccer skill acquisition into three stages: motion-skill acquisition via human motion tracking, lightweight perception-action integration for positional generalization, and physics-aware sim-to-real transfer. This staged decomposition establishes stable foundational skills, avoids reward conflicts during perception integration, and minimizes sim-to-real gaps. Experiments on the Unitree G1 demonstrate high-fidelity human-like kicking with robust performance under diverse conditions-including static or rolling balls, various positions, and disturbances-while maintaining consistent execution across indoor and outdoor scenarios. Our divide-and-conquer strategy advances robust humanoid soccer capabilities and offers a scalable framework for complex embodied skill acquisition.

Abstract: Acquiring large-scale, high-fidelity robot demonstration data remains a critical bottleneck for scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in dexterous manipulation. We propose a Real-Sim-Real data collection and data editing pipeline that transforms human demonstrations into robot-executable, environment-specific training data without direct robot teleoperation. Standardized data collection rooms are built to capture multimodal human demonstrations (synchronized 3 RGB-D videos, 11 RGB videos, 29-DoF glove joint angles, and 14-channel tactile signals). Based on these human demonstrations, we introduce a tactile-aware retargeting method that maps human hand states to robot dex-hand states via geometry and force-guided optimization. Then the retargeted robot trajectories are rendered in a photorealistic Isaac Sim environment to build robot training data. Real world experiments have demonstrated: (1) The retargeted dex-hand trajectories achieve an 84\% success rate across 10 diverse object manipulation tasks. (2) VLA policies (Pi0.5) trained exclusively on our generated data achieve 80\% average success rate on three representative tasks, i.e., pick-and-place, pushing and pouring.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BusyBox is a physical benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language-Action models' affordance generalization using 6 interchangeable modules (switches, sliders, wires, buttons, display, dial) that can be rearranged to create variations with same affordances but different appearances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLA models show promise for generalization, they need affordance generalization - the ability to manipulate new objects with familiar physical features. Current evaluation lacks systematic physical benchmarks for testing this capability.

Method: Created BusyBox with 6 modular components that can be swapped and rotated to create visual variations while maintaining same affordances. Collected language-annotated demonstrations using bimanual Mobile Aloha robot on canonical configuration.

Result: Generalization across BusyBox variants is highly challenging even for strong open-weights VLAs like π₀.₅ and GR00T-N1.6, demonstrating the difficulty of affordance generalization.

Conclusion: BusyBox provides a systematic physical benchmark for evaluating VLA affordance generalization, with released CAD files, bill of materials, and demonstration dataset to enable community evaluation and research.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have been attracting the attention of researchers and practitioners thanks to their promise of generalization. Although single-task policies still offer competitive performance, VLAs are increasingly able to handle commands and environments unseen in their training set. While generalization in vision and language space is undoubtedly important for robust versatile behaviors, a key meta-skill VLAs need to possess is affordance generalization -- the ability to manipulate new objects with familiar physical features.
  In this work, we present BusyBox, a physical benchmark for systematic semi-automatic evaluation of VLAs' affordance generalization. BusyBox consists of 6 modules with switches, sliders, wires, buttons, a display, and a dial. The modules can be swapped and rotated to create a multitude of BusyBox variations with different visual appearances but the same set of affordances. We empirically demonstrate that generalization across BusyBox variants is highly challenging even for strong open-weights VLAs such as $π_{0.5}$ and GR00T-N1.6. To encourage the research community to evaluate their own VLAs on BusyBox and to propose new affordance generalization experiments, we have designed BusyBox to be easy to build in most robotics labs. We release the full set of CAD files for 3D-printing its parts as well as a bill of materials for (optionally) assembling its electronics. We also publish a dataset of language-annotated demonstrations that we collected using the common bimanual Mobile Aloha robot on the canonical BusyBox configuration. All of the released materials are available at https://microsoft.github.io/BusyBox.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a gap between high-level mission objectives and formal executable specifications for safety- and mission-critical robotic systems, especially for complex multi-robot systems like NASA's CADRE mission that require decentralized, resource-aware, and adaptive autonomy.

### [148] [TaSA: Two-Phased Deep Predictive Learning of Tactile Sensory Attenuation for Improving In-Grasp Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05468)
*Pranav Ponnivalavan,Satoshi Funabashi,Alexander Schmitz,Tetsuya Ogata,Shigeki Sugano*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TaSA is a deep learning framework that enables robotic hands to distinguish self-touch from object contact using sensory attenuation principles, improving dexterous manipulation tasks like pencil lead insertion and coin slotting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic hands struggle with dexterous manipulation involving multiple finger contacts because they can't differentiate between self-touch (fingers touching each other) and object contact, leading to potential damage. Humans solve this through sensory attenuation, but most robotic approaches avoid self-contact entirely, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Two-phase deep predictive learning framework: Phase 1 learns self-touch dynamics (how robot actions generate tactile feedback), Phase 2 incorporates this learned model into motion learning to emphasize object contact signals during manipulation.

Result: TaSA achieves significantly higher success rates than baseline methods on insertion tasks requiring fine tactile discrimination: inserting pencil lead into mechanical pencil, inserting coins into slot, and fixing paper clip onto paper with various orientations, positions, and sizes.

Conclusion: Structured tactile perception with self-touch modeling based on sensory attenuation principles is critical for dexterous robotic manipulation, enabling robots to handle complex tasks involving simultaneous multiple contacts.

Abstract: Humans can achieve diverse in-hand manipulations, such as object pinching and tool use, which often involve simultaneous contact between the object and multiple fingers. This is still an open issue for robotic hands because such dexterous manipulation requires distinguishing between tactile sensations generated by their self-contact and those arising from external contact. Otherwise, object/robot breakage happens due to contacts/collisions. Indeed, most approaches ignore self-contact altogether, by constraining motion to avoid/ignore self-tactile information during contact. While this reduces complexity, it also limits generalization to real-world scenarios where self-contact is inevitable. Humans overcome this challenge through self-touch perception, using predictive mechanisms that anticipate the tactile consequences of their own motion, through a principle called sensory attenuation, where the nervous system differentiates predictable self-touch signals, allowing novel object stimuli to stand out as relevant. Deriving from this, we introduce TaSA, a two-phased deep predictive learning framework. In the first phase, TaSA explicitly learns self-touch dynamics, modeling how a robot's own actions generate tactile feedback. In the second phase, this learned model is incorporated into the motion learning phase, to emphasize object contact signals during manipulation. We evaluate TaSA on a set of insertion tasks, which demand fine tactile discrimination: inserting a pencil lead into a mechanical pencil, inserting coins into a slot, and fixing a paper clip onto a sheet of paper, with various orientations, positions, and sizes. Across all tasks, policies trained with TaSA achieve significantly higher success rates than baseline methods, demonstrating that structured tactile perception with self-touch based on sensory attenuation is critical for dexterous robotic manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional drone navigation relies on rule-based or geometric path-planning approaches that require extensive task-specific engineering. There's a need for more flexible, human-friendly control systems that can understand natural language instructions and adapt to dynamic indoor environments for applications like inspection, search-and-rescue, and facility monitoring.

Method: VLN-Pilot leverages a large Vision-and-Language Model (VLLM) as a human pilot replacement.

This includes long-horizon navigation with multiple semantic targets. Results demonstrate the potential for replacing remote human pilots with language-guided autonomous agents.

Conclusion: VLLM-based pilots can dramatically reduce operator workload while improving safety and mission flexibility in constrained indoor environments. The approach opens avenues for scalable, human-friendly control of indoor UAVs, moving beyond traditional navigation methods to enable more natural human-drone interaction.

Abstract: This paper introduces VLN-Pilot, a novel framework in which a large Vision-and-Language Model (VLLM) assumes the role of a human pilot for indoor drone navigation. By leveraging the multimodal reasoning abilities of VLLMs, VLN-Pilot interprets free-form natural language instructions and grounds them in visual observations to plan and execute drone trajectories in GPS-denied indoor environments. Unlike traditional rule-based or geometric path-planning approaches, our framework integrates language-driven semantic understanding with visual perception, enabling context-aware, high-level flight behaviors with minimal task-specific engineering. VLN-Pilot supports fully autonomous instruction-following for drones by reasoning about spatial relationships, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic reactivity to unforeseen events. We validate our framework on a custom photorealistic indoor simulation benchmark and demonstrate the ability of the VLLM-driven agent to achieve high success rates on complex instruction-following tasks, including long-horizon navigation with multiple semantic targets. Experimental results highlight the promise of replacing remote drone pilots with a language-guided autonomous agent, opening avenues for scalable, human-friendly control of indoor UAVs in tasks such as inspection, search-and-rescue, and facility monitoring.

*Hokyun Lee,Woo-Jeong Baek,Junhyeok Cha,Jaeheung Park*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TOLEBI is a fault-tolerant learning framework for bipedal locomotion that handles joint locking, power loss, and external disturbances through simulation training and real-world adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While reinforcement learning for bipedal locomotion has advanced, existing methods don't adequately address hardware faults and environmental disturbances that can occur during real-world operation, potentially causing severe consequences.

Method: TOLEBI uses simulation training with injected faults (joint locking, power loss, external disturbances), transfers policies via sim-to-real, and incorporates an online joint status module that classifies joint conditions using real-time observations.

Result: Validation experiments on the TOCABI humanoid robot in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the framework's applicability and effectiveness in handling faults during locomotion.

Conclusion: This is the first learning-based fault-tolerant framework for bipedal locomotion, advancing the development of robust learning methods for real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: With the growing employment of learning algorithms in robotic applications, research on reinforcement learning for bipedal locomotion has become a central topic for humanoid robotics. While recently published contributions achieve high success rates in locomotion tasks, scarce attention has been devoted to the development of methods that enable to handle hardware faults that may occur during the locomotion process. However, in real-world settings, environmental disturbances or sudden occurrences of hardware faults might yield severe consequences. To address these issues, this paper presents TOLEBI (A faulT-tOlerant Learning framEwork for Bipedal locomotIon) that handles faults on the robot during operation. Specifically, joint locking, power loss and external disturbances are injected in simulation to learn fault-tolerant locomotion strategies. In addition to transferring the learned policy to the real robot via sim-to-real transfer, an online joint status module incorporated. This module enables to classify joint conditions by referring to the actual observations at runtime under real-world conditions. The validation experiments conducted both in real-world and simulation with the humanoid robot TOCABI highlight the applicability of the proposed approach. To our knowledge, this manuscript provides the first learning-based fault-tolerant framework for bipedal locomotion, thereby fostering the development of efficient learning methods in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the freezing robot problem in dense human crowds where robots struggle to find safe motions and become stuck, by leveraging human motion as guidance rather than treating pedestrians solely as obstacles.

Method: Hierarchical framework with high-level RL policy generating follow points to align robot with compatible pedestrian groups, and low-level MPC for safe short-horizon tracking of this guidance.

Result: Outperforms reactive and learning-based baselines in both offline (recorded trajectories) and online (reactive simulation) settings on real-world and synthetic datasets, showing improved navigation efficiency, safety, and reduced freezing behaviors.

Conclusion: Leveraging human motion as guidance rather than treating humans solely as dynamic obstacles provides a powerful principle for safe and efficient robot navigation in crowds.

Abstract: Navigating through dense human crowds remains a significant challenge for mobile robots. A key issue is the freezing robot problem, where the robot struggles to find safe motions and becomes stuck within the crowd. To address this, we propose HiCrowd, a hierarchical framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with model predictive control (MPC). HiCrowd leverages surrounding pedestrian motion as guidance, enabling the robot to align with compatible crowd flows. A high-level RL policy generates a follow point to align the robot with a suitable pedestrian group, while a low-level MPC safely tracks this guidance with short horizon planning. The method combines long-term crowd aware decision making with safe short-term execution. We evaluate HiCrowd against reactive and learning-based baselines in offline setting (replaying recorded human trajectories) and online setting (human trajectories are updated to react to the robot in simulation). Experiments on a real-world dataset and a synthetic crowd dataset show that our method outperforms in navigation efficiency and safety, while reducing freezing behaviors. Our results suggest that leveraging human motion as guidance, rather than treating humans solely as dynamic obstacles, provides a powerful principle for safe and efficient robot navigation in crowds.

TL;DR: A neuromorphic control framework for vision-guided robotic navigation that resolves indecision through dynamic bifurcation without intensive planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic navigation struggles to combine reactive sensor-based control with model-based planning, especially when facing indecision due to symmetrical goal options. Current approaches either lack decisiveness or require computationally intensive planners.

Method: Uses dynamic neuronal populations to directly transform visual target excitation into motion commands. Implements a dynamic bifurcation mechanism that delays commitment until environmental geometry induces a critical point, inspired by animal cognition and opinion dynamics models.

Result: Validated in simulation environments and on an experimental quadrotor platform. Provides real-time autonomy with minimal computational burden, few interpretable parameters, and seamless integration with image processing pipelines.

Conclusion: The parsimonious neuromorphic framework successfully bridges reactive control and decisive planning for vision-guided navigation, resolving indecision through biologically-inspired mechanisms while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Robotic navigation has historically struggled to reconcile reactive, sensor-based control with the decisive capabilities of model-based planners. This duality becomes critical when the absence of a predominant option among goals leads to indecision, challenging reactive systems to break symmetries without computationally-intense planners. We propose a parsimonious neuromorphic control framework that bridges this gap for vision-guided navigation and tracking. Image pixels from an onboard camera are encoded as inputs to dynamic neuronal populations that directly transform visual target excitation into egocentric motion commands. A dynamic bifurcation mechanism resolves indecision by delaying commitment until a critical point induced by the environmental geometry. Inspired by recently proposed mechanistic models of animal cognition and opinion dynamics, the neuromorphic controller provides real-time autonomy with a minimal computational burden, a small number of interpretable parameters, and can be seamlessly integrated with application-specific image processing pipelines. We validate our approach in simulation environments as well as on an experimental quadrotor platform.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AFT-Handover is a zero-shot generalizable framework for task-oriented handovers that uses LLM-driven affordance reasoning and texture-based affordance transfer to handle novel object-task pairs without prior training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing task-oriented handover approaches rely on object- or task-specific affordances, which limits their generalization to novel scenarios. There's a need for a more flexible system that can handle diverse object-task combinations without extensive training.

Method: The framework integrates LLM-driven affordance reasoning with texture-based affordance transfer. For novel object-task pairs, it retrieves a proxy exemplar from a database, establishes part-level correspondences using LLM reasoning, and transfers affordances through texturization and feature-based point cloud transfer.

Result: AFT-Handover shows improved handover success rates and stronger generalization across diverse task-object pairs compared to baselines. A user study indicates significant preference over state-of-the-art methods, effectively reducing human regrasping before tool use. The framework also demonstrates successful deployment on legged manipulators.

Conclusion: The proposed AFT-Handover framework successfully addresses the generalization limitations of existing task-oriented handover methods through LLM-driven affordance reasoning and texture-based transfer, enabling zero-shot adaptation to novel scenarios and showing practical potential for real-world human-robot collaboration.

Abstract: Task-oriented handovers (TOH) are fundamental to effective human-robot collaboration, requiring robots to present objects in a way that supports the human's intended post-handover use. Existing approaches are typically based on object- or task-specific affordances, but their ability to generalize to novel scenarios is limited. To address this gap, we present AFT-Handover, a framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven affordance reasoning with efficient texture-based affordance transfer to achieve zero-shot, generalizable TOH. Given a novel object-task pair, the method retrieves a proxy exemplar from a database, establishes part-level correspondences via LLM reasoning, and texturizes affordances for feature-based point cloud transfer. We evaluate AFT-Handover across diverse task-object pairs, showing improved handover success rates and stronger generalization compared to baselines. In a comparative user study, our framework is significantly preferred over the current state-of-the-art, effectively reducing human regrasping before tool use. Finally, we demonstrate TOH on legged manipulators, highlighting the potential of our framework for real-world robot-human handovers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based whole-body controllers require robot-specific training, limiting their applicability across different humanoid designs. The paper aims to develop a universal controller that can generalize across various humanoid embodiments with one-time training.

Method: XHugWBC framework uses: (1) physics-consistent morphological randomization during training, (2) semantically aligned observation and action spaces across different robots, and (3) policy architectures that model morphological and dynamical properties.

Result: The universal controller demonstrates strong generalization and robustness across twelve simulated humanoids and seven real-world robots, achieving zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot designs.

Conclusion: XHugWBC successfully enables cross-embodiment humanoid control through a single policy, overcoming the robot-specific training limitation of existing approaches and demonstrating practical universal humanoid control.

Abstract: Learning-based whole-body controllers have become a key driver for humanoid robots, yet most existing approaches require robot-specific training. In this paper, we study the problem of cross-embodiment humanoid control and show that a single policy can robustly generalize across a wide range of humanoid robot designs with one-time training. We introduce XHugWBC, a novel cross-embodiment training framework that enables generalist humanoid control through: (1) physics-consistent morphological randomization, (2) semantically aligned observation and action spaces across diverse humanoid robots, and (3) effective policy architectures modeling morphological and dynamical properties. XHugWBC is not tied to any specific robot. Instead, it internalizes a broad distribution of morphological and dynamical characteristics during training. By learning motion priors from diverse randomized embodiments, the policy acquires a strong structural bias that supports zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robots. Experiments on twelve simulated humanoids and seven real-world robots demonstrate the strong generalization and robustness of the resulting universal controller.

Conclusion: The learning-based multimodal framework provides more reliable terrain perception for humanoid robots in unstructured environments compared to traditional single-sensor approaches.

Abstract: Reliable terrain perception is a critical prerequisite for the deployment of humanoid robots in unstructured, human-centric environments. While traditional systems often rely on manually engineered, single-sensor pipelines, this paper presents a learning-based framework that uses an intermediate, robot-centric heightmap representation. A hybrid Encoder-Decoder Structure (EDS) is introduced, utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for spatial feature extraction fused with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) core for temporal consistency. The architecture integrates multimodal data from an Intel RealSense depth camera, a LIVOX MID-360 LiDAR processed via efficient spherical projection, and an onboard IMU. Quantitative results demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves reconstruction accuracy by 7.2% over depth-only and 9.9% over LiDAR-only configurations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Waste-container recycling tasks require precise lifting with tight geometric tolerances between hooks and container rings, making precise trajectory tracking and swing suppression essential for successful operation.

Method: Residual reinforcement learning combines nominal admittance controller for trajectory tracking and swing damping with PPO-trained residual policy to compensate for unmodeled dynamics. Uses damped least-squares inverse kinematics with nullspace posture term, plus domain randomization for generalization.

Result: Simulation results show improved tracking accuracy, reduced oscillations, and higher lifting success rates compared to using nominal controller alone.

Conclusion: The RRL approach effectively enhances precision and robustness for container lifting tasks without requiring end-to-end learning from scratch, demonstrating practical value for industrial applications.

Abstract: This paper studies the container lifting phase of a waste-container recycling task in urban environments, performed by a hydraulic loader crane equipped with an underactuated discharge unit, and proposes a residual reinforcement learning (RRL) approach that combines a nominal Cartesian controller with a learned residual policy. All experiments are conducted in simulation, where the task is characterized by tight geometric tolerances between the discharge-unit hooks and the container rings relative to the overall crane scale, making precise trajectory tracking and swing suppression essential. The nominal controller uses admittance control for trajectory tracking and pendulum-aware swing damping, followed by damped least-squares inverse kinematics with a nullspace posture term to generate joint velocity commands. A PPO-trained residual policy in Isaac Lab compensates for unmodeled dynamics and parameter variations, improving precision and robustness without requiring end-to-end learning from scratch. We further employ randomized episode initialization and domain randomization over payload properties, actuator gains, and passive joint parameters to enhance generalization. Simulation results demonstrate improved tracking accuracy, reduced oscillations, and higher lifting success rates compared to the nominal controller alone.

Abstract: Indoor micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) are increasingly used for tasks that require close proximity to people, yet practitioners lack practical methods to tune motion limits based on measured impact risk. We present an end-to-end, open toolchain that converts benchtop impact tests into deployable safety governors for drones. First, we describe a compact and replicable impact rig and protocol for capturing force-time profiles across drone classes and contact surfaces. Second, we provide data-driven models that map pre-impact speed to impulse and contact duration, enabling direct computation of speed bounds for a target force limit. Third, we release scripts and a ROS2 node that enforce these bounds online and log compliance, with support for facility-specific policies. We validate the workflow on multiple commercial off-the-shelf quadrotors and representative indoor assets, demonstrating that the derived governors preserve task throughput while meeting force constraints specified by safety stakeholders. Our contribution is a practical bridge from measured impacts to runtime limits, with shareable datasets, code, and a repeatable process that teams can adopt to certify indoor MAV operations near humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-only models often fail in contact-rich manipulation tasks due to occlusion and ambiguous contact states, leading to unrealistic physics violations like object disappearance or teleportation. The paper aims to address these limitations by incorporating tactile sensing to better understand robot-object interactions.

Method: The authors develop multi-task Visuo-Tactile World Models (VT-WM) that capture contact physics through touch reasoning. The model is trained across various contact-rich manipulation tasks, combining visual and tactile inputs to improve physical fidelity in imagination and planning.

Result: VT-WM achieves 33% better object permanence and 29% better compliance with laws of motion in autoregressive rollouts. In zero-shot real-robot experiments, it achieves up to 35% higher success rates, particularly in multi-step, contact-rich tasks. The model also demonstrates versatility by adapting to novel tasks with limited demonstrations.

Conclusion: Integrating tactile sensing with vision significantly improves physical reasoning in manipulation tasks, enabling more realistic world models that better handle occlusion and contact ambiguities. VT-WM's grounding in contact dynamics enhances both imagination quality and planning performance, showing promise for real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: We introduce multi-task Visuo-Tactile World Models (VT-WM), which capture the physics of contact through touch reasoning. By complementing vision with tactile sensing, VT-WM better understands robot-object interactions in contact-rich tasks, avoiding common failure modes of vision-only models under occlusion or ambiguous contact states, such as objects disappearing, teleporting, or moving in ways that violate basic physics. Trained across a set of contact-rich manipulation tasks, VT-WM improves physical fidelity in imagination, achieving 33% better performance at maintaining object permanence and 29% better compliance with the laws of motion in autoregressive rollouts. Moreover, experiments show that grounding in contact dynamics also translates to planning. In zero-shot real-robot experiments, VT-WM achieves up to 35% higher success rates, with the largest gains in multi-step, contact-rich tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world robot deployments require multiple heterogeneous robots with different capabilities to handle assignments cooperatively. Effective information gathering and communication are crucial for coordinating efforts without redundancy in multi-agent settings.

Method: Proposes CommCP, a novel LLM-based decentralized communication framework for Multi-agent Multi-task Embodied Question Answering (MM-EQA). The framework uses conformal prediction to calibrate generated messages, minimizing receiver distractions and enhancing communication reliability.

Result: Experimental results on a new MM-EQA benchmark with photo-realistic household scenarios show that CommCP significantly enhances task success rate and exploration efficiency over baselines.

Conclusion: CommCP effectively addresses the communication challenges in multi-agent embodied question answering through calibrated message generation, demonstrating improved coordination and task performance in realistic household scenarios.

Abstract: To complete assignments provided by humans in natural language, robots must interpret commands, generate and answer relevant questions for scene understanding, and manipulate target objects. Real-world deployments often require multiple heterogeneous robots with different manipulation capabilities to handle different assignments cooperatively. Beyond the need for specialized manipulation skills, effective information gathering is important in completing these assignments. To address this component of the problem, we formalize the information-gathering process in a fully cooperative setting as an underexplored multi-agent multi-task Embodied Question Answering (MM-EQA) problem, which is a novel extension of canonical Embodied Question Answering (EQA), where effective communication is crucial for coordinating efforts without redundancy. To address this problem, we propose CommCP, a novel LLM-based decentralized communication framework designed for MM-EQA. Our framework employs conformal prediction to calibrate the generated messages, thereby minimizing receiver distractions and enhancing communication reliability. To evaluate our framework, we introduce an MM-EQA benchmark featuring diverse, photo-realistic household scenarios with embodied questions. Experimental results demonstrate that CommCP significantly enhances the task success rate and exploration efficiency over baselines. The experiment videos, code, and dataset are available on our project website: https://comm-cp.github.io.

*Luke Whitbread,Lyle J. Palmer,Mark Jenkinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DDPMs as unified conditional density estimators for tabular neuroimaging data, enabling calibrated multivariate normative modeling while maintaining compatibility with standard univariate pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional normative modeling fits one model per imaging-derived phenotype (IDP), which scales well but discards multivariate dependence that may encode coordinated patterns in neuroimaging data.

Method: Propose denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) as unified conditional density estimators for tabular IDPs. Use two denoiser backbones: (1) FiLM-conditioned MLP, and (2) SAINT tabular transformer with feature self-attention and intersample attention. Derive univariate centiles and deviation scores through sampling.

Result: For low dimensions, diffusion models deliver well-calibrated per-IDP outputs comparable to traditional baselines while jointly modeling realistic dependence structure. At higher dimensions (up to 200), transformer backbone remains substantially better calibrated than MLP and better preserves higher-order dependence.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based normative modeling provides a practical route to calibrated multivariate deviation profiles in neuroimaging that remain compatible with standard per-IDP pipelines, enabling scalable joint normative models.

Abstract: Normative modeling estimates reference distributions of biological measures conditional on covariates, enabling centiles and clinically interpretable deviation scores to be derived. Most neuroimaging pipelines fit one model per imaging-derived phenotype (IDP), which scales well but discards multivariate dependence that may encode coordinated patterns. We propose denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) as a unified conditional density estimator for tabular IDPs, from which univariate centiles and deviation scores are derived by sampling. We utilise two denoiser backbones: (i) a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) conditioned multilayer perceptron (MLP) and (ii) a tabular transformer with feature self-attention and intersample attention (SAINT), conditioning covariates through learned embeddings. We evaluate on a synthetic benchmark with heteroscedastic and multimodal age effects and on UK Biobank FreeSurfer phenotypes, scaling from dimension of 2 to 200. Our evaluation suite includes centile calibration (absolute centile error, empirical coverage, and the probability integral transform), distributional fidelity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests), multivariate dependence diagnostics, and nearest-neighbour memorisation analysis. For low dimensions, diffusion models deliver well-calibrated per-IDP outputs comparable to traditional baselines while jointly modeling realistic dependence structure. At higher dimensions, the transformer backbone remains substantially better calibrated than the MLP and better preserves higher-order dependence, enabling scalable joint normative models that remain compatible with standard per-IDP pipelines. These results support diffusion-based normative modeling as a practical route to calibrated multivariate deviation profiles in neuroimaging.

### [163] [A Causal Perspective for Enhancing Jailbreak Attack and Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04893)
*Licheng Pan,Yunsheng Lu,Jiexi Liu,Jialing Tao,Haozhe Feng,Hui Xue,Zhixuan Chu,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Causal Analyst framework uses LLMs and causal discovery to identify direct causes of jailbreaks, revealing specific prompt features as causal drivers and applying insights for both attack enhancement and defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak studies focus on latent representations but overlook causal relationships between interpretable prompt features and jailbreak occurrences, leaving mechanisms poorly understood.

Method: Proposes Causal Analyst framework integrating LLMs into data-driven causal discovery; creates comprehensive dataset of 35k jailbreak attempts across 7 LLMs; jointly trains LLM-based prompt encoding and GNN-based causal graph learning to reconstruct causal pathways.

Result: Identifies specific features like "Positive Character" and "Number of Task Steps" as direct causal drivers of jailbreaks; demonstrates practical utility through Jailbreaking Enhancer (boosts attack success rates) and Guardrail Advisor (extracts malicious intent from obfuscated queries).

Conclusion: Analyzing jailbreak features from a causal perspective is effective and interpretable for improving LLM reliability, with causal analysis showing superiority over non-causal approaches.

Abstract: Uncovering the mechanisms behind "jailbreaks" in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their safety and reliability, yet these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Existing studies predominantly analyze jailbreak prompts by probing latent representations, often overlooking the causal relationships between interpretable prompt features and jailbreak occurrences. In this work, we propose Causal Analyst, a framework that integrates LLMs into data-driven causal discovery to identify the direct causes of jailbreaks and leverage them for both attack and defense. We introduce a comprehensive dataset comprising 35k jailbreak attempts across seven LLMs, systematically constructed from 100 attack templates and 50 harmful queries, annotated with 37 meticulously designed human-readable prompt features. By jointly training LLM-based prompt encoding and GNN-based causal graph learning, we reconstruct causal pathways linking prompt features to jailbreak responses. Our analysis reveals that specific features, such as "Positive Character" and "Number of Task Steps", act as direct causal drivers of jailbreaks. We demonstrate the practical utility of these insights through two applications: (1) a Jailbreaking Enhancer that targets identified causal features to significantly boost attack success rates on public benchmarks, and (2) a Guardrail Advisor that utilizes the learned causal graph to extract true malicious intent from obfuscated queries. Extensive experiments, including baseline comparisons and causal structure validation, confirm the robustness of our causal analysis and its superiority over non-causal approaches. Our results suggest that analyzing jailbreak features from a causal perspective is an effective and interpretable approach for improving LLM reliability.

### [164] [Momentum Attention: The Physics of In-Context Learning and Spectral Forensics for Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04902)
*Kingsuk Maitra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Momentum Attention, a symplectic augmentation to Transformers that embeds physical priors via kinematic momentum, enabling single-layer induction heads and revealing a fundamental symplectic-filter duality between physical shear and high-pass filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the mechanistic interpretability program by viewing Transformers as physical circuits with conservation laws and time-varying dynamics, connecting generative AI with Hamiltonian physics and signal processing.

Method: Introduces Momentum Attention with symplectic shear transformation using kinematic momentum operator p_t = q_t - q_{t-1}, implementing symplectic shear on queries and keys. Formalizes symplectic-filter duality and orthogonality theorem for DC/AC signal segregation.

Result: 125M Momentum model exceeds expectations on induction-heavy tasks while tracking 350M baseline within ~2.9% validation loss. Establishes momentum-depth fungibility scaling law γ* = 4.17 × N^{-0.74} and enables single-layer induction heads, bypassing topological depth constraint.

Conclusion: The framework provides a complementary analytical toolkit connecting generative AI, Hamiltonian physics, and signal processing, demonstrating that injecting kinematic momentum enables direct access to velocity information and overcomes architectural limitations.

Abstract: The Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) program has mapped the Transformer as a precise computational graph. We extend this graph with a conservation law and time-varying AC dynamics, viewing it as a physical circuit. We introduce Momentum Attention, a symplectic augmentation embedding physical priors via the kinematic difference operator $p_t = q_t - q_{t-1}$, implementing the symplectic shear $\hat{q}_t = q_t + γp_t$ on queries and keys. We identify a fundamental Symplectic-Filter Duality: the physical shear is mathematically equivalent to a High-Pass Filter. This duality is our cornerstone contribution -- by injecting kinematic momentum, we sidestep the topological depth constraint ($L \geq 2$) for induction head formation. While standard architectures require two layers for induction from static positions, our extension grants direct access to velocity, enabling Single-Layer Induction and Spectral Forensics via Bode Plots. We formalize an Orthogonality Theorem proving that DC (semantic) and AC (mechanistic) signals segregate into orthogonal frequency bands when Low-Pass RoPE interacts with High-Pass Momentum. Validated through 5,100+ controlled experiments (documented in Supplementary Appendices A--R and 27 Jupyter notebooks), our 125M Momentum model exceeds expectations on induction-heavy tasks while tracking a 350M baseline within $\sim$2.9% validation loss. Dedicated associative recall experiments reveal a scaling law $γ^* = 4.17 \times N^{-0.74}$ establishing momentum-depth fungibility. We offer this framework as a complementary analytical toolkit connecting Generative AI, Hamiltonian Physics, and Signal Processing.

*Eitan Sprejer,Oscar Agustín Stanchi,María Victoria Carro,Denise Alejandra Mester,Iván Arcuschin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Feature steering methods successfully control LLM behaviors but cause dramatic performance degradation on accuracy and coherence, making simple prompting a better overall approach for practical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the practical effectiveness of feature steering methods in real-world applications and understand potential trade-offs with output quality, as current understanding of these trade-offs remains poor despite feature steering's promise for controlling LLM behavior.

Method: Evaluated Goodfire's Auto Steer against prompt engineering baselines across 14 steering queries covering innocuous and safety-relevant behaviors on 171 MMLU questions using Llama-8B and Llama-70B models, measuring accuracy, coherence, and behavioral control.

Result: Auto Steer successfully modifies target behaviors (3.33 vs. 2.98 for prompting on Llama-8B; 3.57 vs. 3.10 on Llama-70B) but causes dramatic performance degradation: accuracy drops from 66% to 46% on Llama-8B and 87% to 73% on Llama-70B, with coherence falling from 4.62 to 2.24 and 4.94 to 3.89 respectively.

Conclusion: Simple prompting achieves the best overall balance, highlighting limitations of current feature steering methods for practical deployment where task performance cannot be sacrificed, and demonstrating that mechanistic control methods face fundamental capability-behavior trade-offs that must be empirically characterized before deployment.

Abstract: Feature steering has emerged as a promising approach for controlling LLM behavior through direct manipulation of internal representations, offering advantages over prompt engineering. However, its practical effectiveness in real-world applications remains poorly understood, particularly regarding potential trade-offs with output quality. We show that feature steering methods substantially degrade model performance even when successfully controlling target behaviors, a critical trade-off. Specifically, we evaluate Goodfire's Auto Steer against prompt engineering baselines across 14 steering queries (covering innocuous and safety-relevant behaviors) on 171 Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) questions using Llama-8B and Llama-70B, measuring accuracy, coherence, and behavioral control. Our findings show that Auto Steer successfully modifies target behaviors (achieving scores of 3.33 vs. 2.98 for prompting on Llama-8B and 3.57 vs. 3.10 on Llama-70B), but causes dramatic performance degradation: accuracy on the MMLU questions drops from 66% to 46% on Llama-8B and 87% to 73% on Llama-70B, with coherence falling from 4.62 to 2.24 and 4.94 to 3.89 respectively. Simple prompting achieves the best overall balance. These findings highlight limitations of current feature steering methods for practical deployment where task performance cannot be sacrificed. More broadly, our work demonstrates that mechanistic control methods face fundamental capability-behavior trade-offs that must be empirically characterized before deployment.

### [166] [DCER: Dual-Stage Compression and Energy-Based Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04904)
*Yiwen Wang,Jiahao Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DCER is a unified multimodal fusion framework that addresses noisy inputs and missing modalities through dual-stage compression and energy-based reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal fusion faces two key robustness challenges: 1) noisy inputs degrade representation quality, and 2) missing modalities cause prediction failures. Existing methods often don't handle both problems effectively.

Method: DCER uses dual-stage compression: within-modality frequency transforms (wavelet for audio, DCT for video) remove noise while preserving task-relevant patterns, and cross-modality bottleneck tokens force genuine integration. For missing modalities, energy-based reconstruction recovers representations via gradient descent on a learned energy function.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS benchmarks. Shows U-shaped robustness pattern favoring multimodal fusion at both complete and high-missing conditions. Energy function provides intrinsic uncertainty quantification with ρ > 0.72 correlation with prediction error.

Conclusion: DCER provides a unified solution for multimodal robustness challenges, effectively handling both noisy inputs and missing modalities while offering uncertainty quantification, making it suitable for real-world applications where data quality varies.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion faces two robustness challenges: noisy inputs degrade representation quality, and missing modalities cause prediction failures. We propose DCER, a
  unified framework addressing both challenges through dual-stage compression and energy-based reconstruction. The compression stage operates at two levels:
  within-modality frequency transforms (wavelet for audio, DCT for video) remove noise while preserving task-relevant patterns, and cross-modality bottleneck tokens
  force genuine integration rather than modality-specific shortcuts. For missing modalities, energy-based reconstruction recovers representations via gradient descent
  on a learned energy function, with the final energy providing intrinsic uncertainty quantification (\r{ho} > 0.72 correlation with prediction error). Experiments on
  CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks, with a U-shaped robustness pattern favoring multimodal fusion at
  both complete and high-missing conditions. The code will be available on Github.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an entropy-based lifelong ensemble learning method called "logifold" that uses conservation laws and entropy decrease principles to defend against adversarial attacks, showing improved accuracy over naive ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop more robust defense mechanisms against transfer-based adversarial attacks by applying fundamental learning dynamics principles (conservation law and entropy decrease) to create better ensemble learning approaches.

Method: Formulates learning dynamics laws (conservation law and total entropy decrease), then introduces an entropy-based lifelong ensemble learning method called "logifold" that constructs an immunization mechanism against adversarial attacks.

Result: The logifold method achieves higher accuracy than naive ensembles (simple averaging of clean and adversarial-specialized models) on CIFAR-10, with particularly large gains under strong perturbations.

Conclusion: Entropy-based lifelong ensemble learning using fundamental learning dynamics principles provides an effective defense against adversarial attacks, outperforming simpler ensemble approaches especially under strong perturbations.

Abstract: We formulate the fundamental laws governing learning dynamics, namely the conservation law and the decrease of total entropy. Within this framework, we introduce an entropy-based lifelong ensemble learning method. We evaluate its effectiveness by constructing an immunization mechanism to defend against transfer-based adversarial attacks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Compared with a naive ensemble formed by simply averaging models specialized on clean and adversarial samples, the resulting logifold achieves higher accuracy in most test cases, with particularly large gains under strong perturbations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of adapting time-series models to changing dynamics at inference time without retraining, leveraging in-context learning principles for dynamical systems.

Method: LISA combines delay-coordinate embeddings with Laplacian spectral learning to create diffusion-coordinate state representations, then uses lightweight latent-space residual adapters (Gaussian-process regression or attention-like Markov operators) over context windows for inference-time adaptation.

Result: LISA improves over frozen baselines in forecasting and autoregressive rollout experiments, showing particular benefits under changing dynamics conditions.

Conclusion: The work successfully links in-context adaptation to nonparametric spectral methods for dynamical systems, providing a practical approach for inference-time model adaptation using only observed data prefixes.

Abstract: We propose Laplacian In-context Spectral Analysis (LISA), a method for inference-time adaptation of Laplacian-based time-series models using only an observed prefix. LISA combines delay-coordinate embeddings and Laplacian spectral learning to produce diffusion-coordinate state representations, together with a frozen nonlinear decoder for one-step prediction. We introduce lightweight latent-space residual adapters based on either Gaussian-process regression or an attention-like Markov operator over context windows. Across forecasting and autoregressive rollout experiments, LISA improves over the frozen baseline and is often most beneficial under changing dynamics. This work links in-context adaptation to nonparametric spectral methods for dynamical systems.

### [169] [Physics as the Inductive Bias for Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04907)
*Jianhong Chen,Naichen Shi,Xubo Yue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Integrates physical knowledge (ODEs) with data-driven causal discovery for dynamical systems using SDEs with physics-informed drift and data-driven diffusion terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real dynamical systems often have feedback, cycles, and non-stationarity, while many causal discovery methods assume acyclicity or equilibrium. Integrating physics-based models with data-driven causal discovery can improve identifiability, stability, and robustness.

Method: Models system evolution as stochastic differential equations (SDEs) where drift encodes known ODE dynamics and diffusion represents unknown causal couplings. Develops scalable sparsity-inducing MLE algorithm exploiting causal graph structure for efficient parameter estimation.

Result: Establishes theoretical guarantees for causal graph recovery under mild conditions. Experiments show improved causal graph recovery and more stable, physically consistent estimates compared to purely data-driven baselines.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates physical knowledge as inductive bias for causal discovery in dynamical systems, addressing challenges of feedback, cycles, and non-stationarity while improving recovery and consistency.

Abstract: Causal discovery is often a data-driven paradigm to analyze complex real-world systems. In parallel, physics-based models such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide mechanistic structure for many dynamical processes. Integrating these paradigms potentially allows physical knowledge to act as an inductive bias, improving identifiability, stability, and robustness of causal discovery in dynamical systems. However, such integration remains challenging: real dynamical systems often exhibit feedback, cyclic interactions, and non-stationary data trend, while many widely used causal discovery methods are formulated under acyclicity or equilibrium-based assumptions. In this work, we propose an integrative causal discovery framework for dynamical systems that leverages partial physical knowledge as an inductive bias. Specifically, we model system evolution as a stochastic differential equation (SDE), where the drift term encodes known ODE dynamics and the diffusion term corresponds to unknown causal couplings beyond the prescribed physics. We develop a scalable sparsity-inducing MLE algorithm that exploits causal graph structure for efficient parameter estimation. Under mild conditions, we establish guarantees to recover the causal graph. Experiments on dynamical systems with diverse causal structures show that our approach improves causal graph recovery and produces more stable, physically consistent estimates than purely data-driven state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for analyzing theoretical limits of pool-based active learning by reformulating it as a noisy lossy compression problem, enabling unified analysis of data selection and learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish theoretical limits for pool-based active learning by providing a unified information-theoretic framework that can analyze both data selection and learning processes together, which hasn't been done before using information-theoretic bounds and stability theory.

Method: Reformulates pool-based active learning as a noisy lossy compression problem: pool observations → noisy symbol observations, data selection → compression, learning → decoding. Applies finite blocklength analysis of noisy lossy compression to derive information-theoretic lower bounds.

Result: Derives information-theoretic lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error that serve as theoretical limits for learning algorithms under optimal data selection strategies. The bounds include terms reflecting overfitting and discrepancy between inductive bias and target task.

Conclusion: Provides a new theoretical perspective on pool-based active learning by connecting it to information theory and stability theory, enabling unified analysis of data selection and learning with theoretical limits that account for algorithm-specific characteristics.

Abstract: This paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the theoretical limits of pool-based active learning (AL), in which a subset of instances is selectively labeled. The proposed framework reformulates pool-based AL as a noisy lossy compression problem by mapping pool observations to noisy symbol observations, data selection to compression, and learning to decoding. This correspondence enables a unified information-theoretic analysis of data selection and learning in pool-based AL. Applying finite blocklength analysis of noisy lossy compression, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error that serve as theoretical limits for a given learning algorithm under its associated optimal data selection strategy. Specifically, our bounds include terms that reflect overfitting induced by the learning algorithm and the discrepancy between its inductive bias and the target task, and are closely related to established information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, which have not been previously applied to the analysis of pool-based AL. These properties yield a new theoretical perspective on pool-based AL.

### [171] [Temporal Pair Consistency for Variance-Reduced Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04908)
*Chika Maduabuchi,Jindong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TPC reduces variance in continuous-time generative models by coupling velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, improving sampling efficiency without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous-time generative models (diffusion, flow matching, rectified flow) suffer from high estimator variance and inefficient sampling due to independent timestep training objectives. Existing solutions require explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths/solvers.

Method: Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC) - a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path. Operates at estimator level without modifying model architecture, probability path, or solver. Provides theoretical analysis showing TPC induces quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization.

Result: TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods. Extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.

Conclusion: TPC offers an effective, lightweight approach to variance reduction in continuous-time generative models that preserves the underlying flow-matching objective while improving sampling efficiency and quality across various architectures and training paradigms.

Abstract: Continuous-time generative models, such as diffusion models, flow matching, and rectified flow, learn time-dependent vector fields but are typically trained with objectives that treat timesteps independently, leading to high estimator variance and inefficient sampling. Prior approaches mitigate this via explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths and solvers. We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that TPC induces a quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization that provably reduces gradient variance while preserving the underlying flow-matching objective. Instantiated within flow matching, TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods, and extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.

### [172] [Thermodynamic Limits of Physical Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05463)
*Koichi Takahashi,Yusuke Hayashi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two bits-per-joule metrics (Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule and Empowerment per Joule) to measure physical intelligence efficiency, establishes thermodynamic foundations, and provides a unified framework for consistent energy efficiency comparisons in AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern AI systems achieve remarkable capabilities but consume substantial energy. There's a need to connect intelligence to physical efficiency through standardized metrics that account for energy consumption in information processing and control tasks.

Method: Proposes two complementary metrics: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule (bits of structural information encoded per unit energy) for recognition/model-building, and (2) Empowerment per Joule (sensorimotor channel capacity per expected energetic cost) for control/action influence. Uses stochastic thermodynamics to establish theoretical foundations and provides practical measurement approaches including MDL-epiplexity surrogates for empirical settings.

Result: Establishes thermodynamic foundations showing Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmarks for epiplexity acquisition, clarifies boundary assumptions, and demonstrates that without explicit accounting conventions, information gain and dissipation need not be tightly linked. Provides a unified framework with reporting conventions to reduce ambiguity in bits-per-joule comparisons.

Conclusion: The proposed bits-per-joule metrics and unified framework enable consistent measurement and comparison of physical intelligence efficiency across AI systems, connecting information processing capabilities to energy consumption with proper accounting conventions.

Abstract: Modern AI systems achieve remarkable capabilities at the cost of substantial energy consumption. To connect intelligence to physical efficiency, we propose two complementary bits-per-joule metrics under explicit accounting conventions: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule -- bits of structural information about a theoretical environment-instance variable newly encoded in an agent's internal state per unit measured energy within a stated boundary -- and (2) Empowerment per Joule -- the embodied sensorimotor channel capacity (control information) per expected energetic cost over a fixed horizon. These provide two axes of physical intelligence: recognition (model-building) vs.control (action influence). Drawing on stochastic thermodynamics, we show how a Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmark for epiplexity acquisition follows as a corollary of a standard thermodynamic-learning inequality under explicit subsystem assumptions, and we clarify how Landauer-scaled costs act as closed-cycle benchmarks under explicit reset/reuse and boundary-closure assumptions; conversely, we give a simple decoupling construction showing that without such assumptions -- and without charging for externally prepared low-entropy resources (e.g.fresh memory) crossing the boundary -- information gain and in-boundary dissipation need not be tightly linked. For empirical settings where the latent structure variable is unavailable, we align the operational notion of epiplexity with compute-bounded MDL epiplexity and recommend reporting MDL-epiplexity / compression-gain surrogates as companions. Finally, we propose a unified efficiency framework that reports both metrics together with a minimal checklist of boundary/energy accounting, coarse-graining/noise, horizon/reset, and cost conventions to reduce ambiguity and support consistent bits-per-joule comparisons, and we sketch connections to energy-adjusted scaling analyses.

### [173] [Comparing Euclidean and Hyperbolic K-Means for Generalized Category Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04932)
*Mohamad Dalal,Thomas B. Moeslund,Joakim Bruslund Haurum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HC-GCD introduces hyperbolic clustering for Generalized Category Discovery by performing K-Means directly in hyperbolic space instead of transforming back to Euclidean space, achieving comparable performance to previous hyperbolic GCD methods with more consistent clustering across label granularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous hyperbolic GCD methods only use hyperbolic geometry for representation learning but transform back to Euclidean space for clustering, which is hypothesized to be suboptimal since it doesn't fully leverage the geometric properties of hyperbolic space for the clustering task.

Method: HC-GCD learns embeddings in the Lorentz Hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry and clusters these embeddings directly in hyperbolic space using a hyperbolic K-Means algorithm, maintaining the hyperbolic geometry throughout the entire process.

Result: HC-GCD achieves performance on par with previous state-of-the-art hyperbolic GCD methods on Semantic Shift Benchmark datasets. Hyperbolic K-Means outperforms Euclidean K-Means, and hyperbolic clustering leads to more consistent clusters when varying label granularity.

Conclusion: Direct hyperbolic clustering is effective for GCD, with hyperbolic K-Means providing better accuracy than Euclidean K-Means and more consistent clustering across different label granularities, though the impact of norm clipping on accuracy is dataset-dependent.

Abstract: Hyperbolic representation learning has been widely used to extract implicit hierarchies within data, and recently it has found its way to the open-world classification task of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). However, prior hyperbolic GCD methods only use hyperbolic geometry for representation learning and transform back to Euclidean geometry when clustering. We hypothesize this is suboptimal. Therefore, we present Hyperbolic Clustered GCD (HC-GCD), which learns embeddings in the Lorentz Hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry, and clusters these embeddings directly in hyperbolic space using a hyperbolic K-Means algorithm. We test our model on the Semantic Shift Benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that HC-GCD is on par with the previous state-of-the-art hyperbolic GCD method. Furthermore, we show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to better accuracy than Euclidean K-Means. We carry out ablation studies showing that clipping the norm of the Euclidean embeddings leads to decreased accuracy in clustering unseen classes, and increased accuracy for seen classes, while the overall accuracy is dataset dependent. We also show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to more consistent clusters when varying the label granularity.

*Youngjae Cho,Jongsuk Kim,Ji-Hoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAPO replaces DPO's fixed reference policy with a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor (adversarial perturbation of current policy) to improve robustness against noisy preferences and distributional mismatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO's static reference becomes miscalibrated as policy drifts, causing distributional mismatch and amplifying noise. Reference-free variants suffer from unconstrained reward drift. Need for adaptive, robust alignment method.

Method: GAPO uses dynamic anchor: adversarial local perturbation of current policy within small radius as pessimistic baseline. Introduces Anchor Gap (reward discrepancy between policy and anchor) to approximate worst-case local margin degradation. Optimizes logistic objective weighted by this gap to downweight brittle instances.

Result: GAPO consistently improves robustness across diverse noise settings while matching or improving performance on standard LLM alignment and reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Geometry-aware dynamic anchors provide adaptive reweighting mechanism that enhances robustness to noisy supervision while maintaining strong alignment performance.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and related methods align large language models from pairwise preferences by regularizing updates against a fixed reference policy. As the policy drifts, a static reference, however, can become increasingly miscalibrated, leading to distributional mismatch and amplifying spurious preference signals under noisy supervision. Conversely, reference-free variants avoid mismatch but often suffer from unconstrained reward drift. We propose Geometric Anchor Preference Optimization (GAPO), which replaces the fixed reference with a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor: an adversarial local perturbation of the current policy within a small radius that serves as a pessimistic baseline. This anchor enables an adaptive reweighting mechanism, modulating the importance of each preference pair based on its local sensitivity. We further introduce the Anchor Gap, the reward discrepancy between the policy and its anchor, and show under smoothness conditions that it approximates worst-case local margin degradation. Optimizing a logistic objective weighted by this gap downweights geometrically brittle instances while emphasizing robust preference signals. Across diverse noise settings, GAPO consistently improves robustness while matching or improving performance on standard LLM alignment and reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering items with unknown number of clusters using noisy pairwise comparisons is challenging. Existing methods lack theoretical guarantees on query complexity and optimality for active clustering with bandit feedback.

Method: Uses change-of-measure technique to derive lower bounds on expected queries needed for desired clustering confidence. Designs algorithm with GLR-based stopping criterion, and develops computationally feasible variant of GLR statistic.

Result: Establishes fundamental lower bound formulated as sup-inf optimization problem. Algorithm is asymptotically optimal, with performance gap to lower bound empirically estimable and within constant multiple of the bound.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical foundation and practical algorithm for active clustering with noisy pairwise comparisons, achieving near-optimal query complexity with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We propose a new analysis framework for clustering $M$ items into an unknown number of $K$ distinct groups using noisy and actively collected responses. At each time step, an agent is allowed to query pairs of items and observe bandit binary feedback. If the pair of items belongs to the same (resp.\ different) cluster, the observed feedback is $1$ with probability $p>1/2$ (resp.\ $q<1/2$). Leveraging the ubiquitous change-of-measure technique, we establish a fundamental lower bound on the expected number of queries needed to achieve a desired confidence in the clustering accuracy, formulated as a sup-inf optimization problem. Building on this theoretical foundation, we design an asymptotically optimal algorithm in which the stopping criterion involves an empirical version of the inner infimum -- the Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) statistic -- being compared to a threshold. We develop a computationally feasible variant of the GLR statistic and show that its performance gap to the lower bound can be accurately empirically estimated and remains within a constant multiple of the lower bound.

*E Bowen,R Granger,A Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel graph-based system using low-precision arithmetic and graph-Hamiltonian operators to intrinsically represent relations, enabling both ANN processing and symbolic computation with linear computational scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a system that directly represents relations (like part-whole) using fundamentally different architecture and learning rules from standard ANNs, where relational encoding is intrinsic rather than an add-on, enabling both neural processing and symbolic computation.

Method: Encodes arbitrary data as graphs with edges representing primitive pairwise relations. Uses a graph-Hamiltonian operator to calculate energies among encodings, with ground states indicating satisfaction of all relation constraints. Employs radically low-precision arithmetic for efficiency, with linear scaling relative to edge count.

Result: The system can process standard ANN examples while producing representations exhibiting symbolic computation characteristics. It identifies logical relational structures (part-of, next-to), builds hierarchical representations enabling abductive inference, and generates relational position-based encodings. An equivalent set of ANN operations is derived, suggesting embedded vector encodings for higher-level semantic representation.

Conclusion: The unconventional architecture bridges neural and symbolic computation, offering a simple, efficient approach to relational representation. The current implementation is basic but promising, inviting further development of tools and improvements for enhanced capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce a simple initial working system in which relations (such as part-whole) are directly represented via an architecture with operating and learning rules fundamentally distinct from standard artificial neural network methods. Arbitrary data are straightforwardly encoded as graphs whose edges correspond to codes from a small fixed primitive set of elemental pairwise relations, such that simple relational encoding is not an add-on, but occurs intrinsically within the most basic components of the system. A novel graph-Hamiltonian operator calculates energies among these encodings, with ground states denoting simultaneous satisfaction of all relation constraints among graph vertices. The method solely uses radically low-precision arithmetic; computational cost is correspondingly low, and scales linearly with the number of edges in the data. The resulting unconventional architecture can process standard ANN examples, but also produces representations that exhibit characteristics of symbolic computation. Specifically, the method identifies simple logical relational structures in these data (part-of; next-to), building hierarchical representations that enable abductive inferential steps generating relational position-based encodings, rather than solely statistical representations. Notably, an equivalent set of ANN operations are derived, identifying a special case of embedded vector encodings that may constitute a useful approach to current work in higher-level semantic representation. The very simple current state of the implemented system invites additional tools and improvements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A^2-LLM is an end-to-end conversational audio avatar LLM that jointly generates language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion in a unified framework, achieving superior emotional expressiveness with real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational digital human systems use cascaded architectures that suffer from accumulated errors, high latency, poor real-time performance, and prioritize rigid lip-sync over emotional depth due to lack of access to conversational context.

Method: Proposed A^2-LLM, an end-to-end conversational audio avatar large language model that jointly reasons about language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion within a unified framework. Also introduced FLAME-QA, a high-quality multimodal dataset aligning semantic intent with expressive facial dynamics in QA format.

Result: The system achieves superior emotional expressiveness while maintaining real-time efficiency with 500 ms latency and 0.7 RTF (real-time factor), generating emotionally rich facial movements beyond simple lip-synchronization.

Conclusion: A^2-LLM addresses limitations of cascaded architectures by providing unified end-to-end generation of conversational avatars with deep semantic understanding, enabling emotionally expressive facial movements and real-time performance.

Abstract: Developing expressive and responsive conversational digital humans is a cornerstone of next-generation human-computer interaction. While large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced dialogue capabilities, most current systems still rely on cascaded architectures that connect independent modules. These pipelines are often plagued by accumulated errors, high latency, and poor real-time performance. Lacking access to the underlying conversational context, these pipelines inherently prioritize rigid lip-sync over emotional depth. To address these challenges, we propose A$^2$-LLM, an end-to-end conversational audio avatar large language model that jointly reasons about language, audio prosody, and 3D facial motion within a unified framework. To facilitate training, we introduce FLAME-QA, a high-quality multimodal dataset designed to align semantic intent with expressive facial dynamics within a QA format. By leveraging deep semantic understanding, A$^2$-LLM generates emotionally rich facial movements beyond simple lip-synchronization. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves superior emotional expressiveness while maintaining real-time efficiency (500 ms latency, 0.7 RTF).

*Lixuan Guo,Yifei Wang,Tiansheng Wen,Yifan Wang,Aosong Feng,Bo Chen,Stefanie Jegelka,Chenyu You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CSRv2 enables ultra-sparse embeddings (only 2 active features) to match performance of dense embeddings while achieving 300x compute/memory efficiency gains and 7x speedup over compact dense methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse embedding methods (CSR) suffer severe performance degradation in ultra-sparse regimes where over 80% of neurons remain inactive, leaving much efficiency potential unrealized. There's a need for practical ultra-sparse embeddings that maintain quality while achieving extreme efficiency for real-time and edge-deployable AI systems.

Method: CSRv2 introduces three key innovations: 1) progressive k-annealing to stabilize sparsity learning, 2) supervised contrastive objectives to enhance representational quality, and 3) full backbone finetuning for end-to-end adaptability. This approach reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20%.

Result: CSRv2 achieves 14% accuracy gain at k=2 (only 2 active features), making ultra-sparse embeddings perform on par with CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions. It delivers 7x speedup over MRL and up to 300x improvements in compute/memory efficiency relative to dense embeddings, with 7%/4% improvement over CSR at k=4 and 14%/6% at k=2 in text/vision tasks.

Conclusion: CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance, enabling extreme sparsity that broadens the design space for real-time and edge-deployable AI systems where both embedding quality and efficiency are critical.

Abstract: In the era of large foundation models, the quality of embeddings has become a central determinant of downstream task performance and overall system capability. Yet widely used dense embeddings are often extremely high-dimensional, incurring substantial costs in storage, memory, and inference latency. To address these, Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) is recently proposed as a promising direction, mapping dense embeddings into high-dimensional but k-sparse vectors, in contrast to compact dense embeddings such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). Despite its promise, CSR suffers severe degradation in the ultra-sparse regime, where over 80% of neurons remain inactive, leaving much of its efficiency potential unrealized. In this paper, we introduce CSRv2, a principled training approach designed to make ultra-sparse embeddings viable. CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning through progressive k-annealing, enhances representational quality via supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures end-to-end adaptability with full backbone finetuning. CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20% and delivers a 14% accuracy gain at k=2, bringing ultra-sparse embeddings on par with CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions, all with only two active features. While maintaining comparable performance, CSRv2 delivers a 7x speedup over MRL, and yields up to 300x improvements in compute and memory efficiency relative to dense embeddings in text representation. Extensive experiments across text and vision demonstrate that CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance, where CSRv2 achieves 7%/4% improvement over CSR when k=4 and further increases this gap to 14%/6% when k=2 in text/vision representation. By making extreme sparsity viable, CSRv2 broadens the design space for real-time and edge-deployable AI systems where both embedding quality and efficiency are critical.

*Jose Miguel Luna,Taha Bouhsine,Krzysztof Choromanski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SLAY is a new linear-time attention mechanism using spherical Yat-kernels that achieves near-identical performance to standard softmax attention while maintaining O(L) time/memory complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a linear-time attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention without performance trade-offs, addressing the computational limitations of standard attention in Transformers.

Method: Constrains queries and keys to unit sphere for angular-only attention, uses Bernstein's theorem to express spherical Yat-kernel as nonnegative mixture of polynomial-exponential kernels, and derives positive random-feature approximation for linear-time computation.

Result: SLAY achieves performance nearly indistinguishable from standard softmax attention, consistently outperforms prior linear-time methods (Performers, Cosformers), and represents the closest linear-time approximation to softmax attention reported.

Conclusion: SLAY enables scalable Transformers without typical performance trade-offs of attention linearization, offering geometry-aware, linear-time attention with theoretical guarantees of positive definiteness and boundedness.

Abstract: We propose a new class of linear-time attention mechanisms based on a relaxed and computationally efficient formulation of the recently introduced E-Product, often referred to as the Yat-kernel (Bouhsine, 2025). The resulting interactions are geometry-aware and inspired by inverse-square interactions in physics. Our method, Spherical Linearized Attention with Yat Kernels (SLAY), constrains queries and keys to the unit sphere so that attention depends only on angular alignment. Using Bernstein's theorem, we express the spherical Yat-kernel as a nonnegative mixture of polynomial-exponential product kernels and derive a strictly positive random-feature approximation enabling linear-time O(L) attention. We establish positive definiteness and boundedness on the sphere and show that the estimator yields well-defined, nonnegative attention scores. Empirically, SLAY achieves performance that is nearly indistinguishable from standard softmax attention while retaining linear time and memory scaling, and consistently outperforms prior linear-time attention mechanisms such as Performers and Cosformers. To the best of our knowledge, SLAY represents the closest linear-time approximation to softmax attention reported to date, enabling scalable Transformers without the typical performance trade-offs of attention linearization.

### [180] [How Controlling the Variance can Improve Training Stability of Sparsely Activated DNNs and CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05779)
*Emily Dent,Jared Tanner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Larger Gaussian process variance in Edge-of-Chaos initialization improves expressivity with 90% activation sparsity in DNNs/CNNs using shifted clipped ReLU, enabling energy-efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce energy consumption in machine learning models by enabling high activation sparsity (up to 90%) while maintaining accuracy, through better initialization strategies that leverage Gaussian process characterization of deep networks.

Method: Uses Edge-of-Chaos initialization strategy with Gaussian process characterization, focusing on the under-utilized variance parameter. Applies shifted and clipped ReLU activation (CReLU) to induce sparsity. Analyzes how larger fixed Gaussian process variances affect training stability and expressivity.

Result: Initializations with larger Gaussian process variances enable improved expressivity with activation sparsity as high as 90% in both DNNs and CNNs, while maintaining full or near-full accuracy. This improves training stability and provides a mechanism for energy reduction.

Conclusion: Properly tuning the Gaussian process variance in Edge-of-Chaos initialization is crucial for achieving high activation sparsity without sacrificing accuracy, offering a promising approach to reduce energy consumption in models with fully connected layers.

Abstract: The intermediate layers of deep networks can be characterised as a Gaussian process, in particular the Edge-of-Chaos (EoC) initialisation strategy prescribes the limiting covariance matrix of the Gaussian process. Here we show that the under-utilised chosen variance of the Gaussian process is important in the training of deep networks with sparsity inducing activation, such as a shifted and clipped ReLU, $\text{CReLU}_{τ,m}(x)=\min(\max(x-τ,0),m)$. Specifically, initialisations leading to larger fixed Gaussian process variances, allow for improved expressivity with activation sparsity as large as 90% in DNNs and CNNs, and generally improve the stability of the training process. Enabling full, or near full, accuracy at such high levels of sparsity in the hidden layers suggests a promising mechanism to reduce the energy consumption of machine learning models involving fully connected layers.

*Soshi Kakio,Yasuko Matsubara,Ren Fujiwara,Yasushi Sakurai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HeteroComp: A method for summarizing heterogeneous tensor streams and detecting group anomalies by modeling continuous attributes with Gaussian processes and capturing temporal dynamics without discretization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor decomposition and anomaly detection methods cannot handle heterogeneous streams (mix of categorical and continuous attributes) and fail to track temporal dynamics due to timestamp discretization, making them ineffective for detecting group anomalies like DoS attacks.

Method: Proposes HeteroComp which uses Gaussian process priors to model unknown distributions of continuous attributes and temporal dynamics, directly estimating probability densities from data. It continuously summarizes heterogeneous tensor streams into components representing latent groups in each attribute and their temporal dynamics.

Result: Extensive experiments on real datasets show HeteroComp outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for group anomaly detection accuracy, and its computational time does not depend on data stream length.

Conclusion: HeteroComp effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by handling heterogeneous attributes without distortion and capturing temporal dynamics for accurate group anomaly detection in event tensor streams.

Abstract: Analysis and anomaly detection in event tensor streams consisting of timestamps and multiple attributes - such as communication logs(time, IP address, packet length)- are essential tasks in data mining. While existing tensor decomposition and anomaly detection methods provide useful insights, they face the following two limitations. (i) They cannot handle heterogeneous tensor streams, which comprises both categorical attributes(e.g., IP address) and continuous attributes(e.g., packet length). They typically require either discretizing continuous attributes or treating categorical attributes as continuous, both of which distort the underlying statistical properties of the data.Furthermore, incorrect assumptions about the distribution family of continuous attributes often degrade the model's performance. (ii) They discretize timestamps, failing to track the temporal dynamics of streams(e.g., trends, abnormal events), which makes them ineffective for detecting anomalies at the group level, referred to as 'group anomalies' (e.g, DoS attacks). To address these challenges, we propose HeteroComp, a method for continuously summarizing heterogeneous tensor streams into 'components' representing latent groups in each attribute and their temporal dynamics, and detecting group anomalies. Our method employs Gaussian process priors to model unknown distributions of continuous attributes, and temporal dynamics, which directly estimate probability densities from data. Extracted components give concise but effective summarization, enabling accurate group anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that HeteroComp outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for group anomaly detection accuracy, and its computational time does not depend on the data stream length.

### [182] [Simulated Adoption: Decoupling Magnitude and Direction in LLM In-Context Conflict Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04918)
*Long Zhang,Fangwei Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs prioritize conflicting in-context information over parametric memory (sycophancy/compliance), but the mechanism was unclear. Analysis shows it's not "Manifold Dilution" but "Orthogonal Interference" - conflicting contexts inject quasi-orthogonal steering vectors that rotate hidden states, bypassing correct unembedding while preserving original magnitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanistic basis of how LLMs resolve knowledge conflicts through compliance/sycophancy - specifically whether this suppression arises from signal magnitude dilution or directional geometric alteration within the residual stream.

Method: Conducted layer-wise geometric analysis across Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B, decomposing residual stream updates induced by counter-factual contexts into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components.

Result: Rejected the "Manifold Dilution" hypothesis (only 1/3 architectures showed norm changes). Found compliance is consistently characterized by "Orthogonal Interference" - conflicting contexts inject quasi-orthogonal steering vectors that rotate hidden state representations, effectively bypassing correct unembedding vectors while preserving original structural magnitude.

Conclusion: Models don't "unlearn" or suppress internal truth magnitude but use geometric displacement to bypass correct unembedding. This challenges scalar confidence metrics for hallucination detection and underscores the need for vectorial monitoring to distinguish genuine knowledge integration from superficial in-context mimicry.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently prioritize conflicting in-context information over pre-existing parametric memory, a phenomenon often termed sycophancy or compliance. However, the mechanistic realization of this behavior remains obscure, specifically how the model resolves these knowledge conflicts through compliance, and whether this suppression arises from signal magnitude dilution or directional geometric alteration within the residual stream. To resolve this, we conducted a layer-wise geometric analysis across Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B, decomposing the residual stream updates induced by counter-factual contexts into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components. Our empirical results reject the universality of the "Manifold Dilution" hypothesis, as two of the three architectures maintained stable residual norms despite exhibiting significant performance degradation on factual queries. Instead, we observed that compliance is consistently characterized by "Orthogonal Interference," where the conflicting context injects a steering vector that is quasi-orthogonal to the ground-truth direction, effectively rotating the hidden state representation. This suggests that models do not "unlearn" or suppress the magnitude of internal truths but rather employ a mechanism of geometric displacement to bypass the correct unembedding vector, effectively simulating adoption while preserving the original structural magnitude. These findings challenge scalar confidence metrics for detecting hallucinations and underscore the necessity of vectorial monitoring to distinguish between genuine knowledge integration and superficial in-context mimicry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies exact community recovery in networks with node attributes, introduces Chernoff-TV divergence to characterize sharp recovery thresholds, and provides efficient algorithms achieving these thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While classical stochastic block models focus on graph connectivity alone, real-world networks often contain additional node attributes/labels. The authors aim to understand how such side information affects exact community recovery thresholds and develop theoretical foundations for the Data Block Model.

Method: The authors study the Data Block Model (DBM), an SBM augmented with node-associated data. They introduce the Chernoff-TV divergence as a key theoretical tool to characterize exact recovery thresholds. They develop an efficient algorithm that achieves the threshold and provide matching converse results showing impossibility below the threshold.

Result: The paper establishes a sharp exact recovery threshold for the DBM using Chernoff-TV divergence. They prove their algorithm achieves this threshold, and simulations validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating benefits of incorporating vertex data in community detection.

Conclusion: Node attributes provide valuable side information that improves community detection performance. The Chernoff-TV divergence offers a principled way to characterize exact recovery thresholds in models with additional data, with practical implications for analyzing real-world networks.

Abstract: Community detection in networks is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistical inference, with applications in social networks, biological systems, and communication networks. The stochastic block model (SBM) serves as a canonical framework for studying community structure, and exact recovery, identifying the true communities with high probability, is a central theoretical question. While classical results characterize the phase transition for exact recovery based solely on graph connectivity, many real-world networks contain additional data, such as node attributes or labels. In this work, we study exact recovery in the Data Block Model (DBM), an SBM augmented with node-associated data, as formalized by Asadi, Abbe, and Verdú (2017). We introduce the Chernoff--TV divergence and use it to characterize a sharp exact recovery threshold for the DBM. We further provide an efficient algorithm that achieves this threshold, along with a matching converse result showing impossibility below the threshold. Finally, simulations validate our findings and demonstrate the benefits of incorporating vertex data as side information in community detection.

TL;DR: PTL (Prune-Tune Loop) is a gradual compression method that iteratively prunes and fine-tunes LLMs to reduce size by ~50% while maintaining reasoning performance with minimal post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require significant computational resources, but conventional pruning methods cause dramatic performance drops in reasoning tasks and need extensive retraining. There's a need for efficient compression that preserves reasoning capabilities.

Method: Gradual compacting method using Prune-Tune Loop (PTL): multiple fine-grained iterations where each stage applies pruning followed by tuning. This iterative approach prevents abrupt performance loss by incrementally reducing model size while restoring performance with fine-tuning.

Result: PTL can compress LLMs to nearly half their original size with only lightweight post-training, maintaining performance comparable to original models on reasoning tasks. Works with various pruning strategies (neuron/layer pruning) and post-training methods (continual pre-training, RL). Effective beyond math reasoning to tasks like code generation.

Conclusion: PTL provides a flexible, effective approach for LLM compression that preserves reasoning capabilities with minimal retraining, offering broad applicability across different pruning strategies and task domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, but their substantial size often demands significant computational resources. To reduce resource consumption and accelerate inference, it is essential to eliminate redundant parameters without compromising performance. However, conventional pruning methods that directly remove such parameters often lead to a dramatic drop in model performance in reasoning tasks, and require extensive post-training to recover the lost capabilities. In this work, we propose a gradual compacting method that divides the compression process into multiple fine-grained iterations, applying a Prune-Tune Loop (PTL) at each stage to incrementally reduce model size while restoring performance with finetuning. This iterative approach-reminiscent of the "boiling frog" effect-enables the model to be progressively compressed without abrupt performance loss. Experimental results show that PTL can compress LLMs to nearly half their original size with only lightweight post-training, while maintaining performance comparable to the original model on reasoning tasks. Moreover, PTL is flexible and can be applied to various pruning strategies, such as neuron pruning and layer pruning, as well as different post-training methods, including continual pre-training and reinforcement learning. Additionally, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of PTL on a variety of tasks beyond mathematical reasoning, such as code generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.

TL;DR: CyIN framework bridges complete and incomplete multimodal learning using cyclic information bottleneck and cross-modal translation to handle dynamic missing modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multimodal deployments face unpredictable modality availability, causing pre-trained models to suffer performance drops when modalities are missing, unlike the perfectly paired data they were trained on.

Method: Cyclic INformative Learning (CyIN) uses token- and label-level Information Bottleneck cyclically to build informative latent space, plus cross-modal cyclic translation to reconstruct missing modalities through forward/reverse propagation.

Result: Extensive experiments on 4 multimodal datasets show superior performance in both complete and diverse incomplete scenarios compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: CyIN successfully bridges the gap between complete and incomplete multimodal learning, enabling robust performance with dynamic missing modalities in a unified model.

Abstract: Multimodal machine learning, mimicking the human brain's ability to integrate various modalities has seen rapid growth. Most previous multimodal models are trained on perfectly paired multimodal input to reach optimal performance. In real-world deployments, however, the presence of modality is highly variable and unpredictable, causing the pre-trained models in suffering significant performance drops and fail to remain robust with dynamic missing modalities circumstances. In this paper, we present a novel Cyclic INformative Learning framework (CyIN) to bridge the gap between complete and incomplete multimodal learning. Specifically, we firstly build an informative latent space by adopting token- and label-level Information Bottleneck (IB) cyclically among various modalities. Capturing task-related features with variational approximation, the informative bottleneck latents are purified for more efficient cross-modal interaction and multimodal fusion. Moreover, to supplement the missing information caused by incomplete multimodal input, we propose cross-modal cyclic translation by reconstruct the missing modalities with the remained ones through forward and reverse propagation process. With the help of the extracted and reconstructed informative latents, CyIN succeeds in jointly optimizing complete and incomplete multimodal learning in one unified model. Extensive experiments on 4 multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both complete and diverse incomplete scenarios.

TL;DR: Neural operators struggle with complex boundary conditions; this paper proposes a framework using function extensions to map boundary data to latent pseudo-extensions, enabling standard architectures to handle diverse BCs effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators have limitations in handling general, highly variable boundary conditions, especially when solution operators are sensitive to boundary forcings. Existing approaches often fail in these challenging scenarios.

Method: Proposes a general framework that maps boundary data to latent pseudo-extensions defined over the entire spatial domain. This allows any standard neural operator architecture to consume boundary information alongside domain functions, learning rich dependencies on complex BCs simultaneously.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on 18 challenging datasets spanning Poisson, linear elasticity, and hyperelasticity problems with highly variable, mixed-type, component-wise, and multi-segment BCs on diverse geometries. Outperforms baselines by large margins without requiring hyperparameter tuning across datasets.

Conclusion: Learning boundary-to-domain extensions is an effective and practical strategy for imposing complex BCs in existing neural operator frameworks, enabling accurate and robust scientific machine learning models for a broader range of PDE-governed problems.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as powerful surrogates for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), yet their ability to handle general, highly variable boundary conditions (BCs) remains limited. Existing approaches often fail when the solution operator exhibits strong sensitivity to boundary forcings. We propose a general framework for conditioning neural operators on complex non-homogeneous BCs through function extensions. Our key idea is to map boundary data to latent pseudo-extensions defined over the entire spatial domain, enabling any standard operator learning architecture to consume boundary information. The resulting operator, coupled with an arbitrary domain-to-domain neural operator, can learn rich dependencies on complex BCs and input domain functions at the same time. To benchmark this setting, we construct 18 challenging datasets spanning Poisson, linear elasticity, and hyperelasticity problems, with highly variable, mixed-type, component-wise, and multi-segment BCs on diverse geometries. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming baselines by large margins, while requiring no hyperparameter tuning across datasets. Overall, our results demonstrate that learning boundary-to-domain extensions is an effective and practical strategy for imposing complex BCs in existing neural operator frameworks, enabling accurate and robust scientific machine learning models for a broader range of PDE-governed problems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reliable AVQA (R-AVQA), focusing on abstention over incorrect answers, and proposes Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR) to improve confidence calibration in multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AVQA models achieve high accuracy but lack reliable mechanisms to identify when they're likely wrong and abstain from answering incorrectly. There's a research gap in making AVQA models more reliable through proper confidence calibration and abstention strategies.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR), a lightweight method that maintains Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) as primary confidence signal but adds two learned heads: 1) Residual Risk Head that predicts low-magnitude correctness residuals, and 2) Confidence Gating Head to determine MSP trustworthiness, applying input-adaptive residual corrections when MSP is unreliable.

Result: ACR consistently outperforms existing methods on in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and data bias settings across three different AVQA architectures, establishing a solid foundation for the R-AVQA task.

Conclusion: The paper presents a formal problem formulation for reliable AVQA and demonstrates that ACR effectively enhances model reliability by improving confidence calibration without replacing MSP, offering a practical solution for abstention-based reliable multimodal question answering.

Abstract: We present a formal problem formulation for \textit{Reliable} Audio-Visual Question Answering ($\mathcal{R}$-AVQA), where we prefer abstention over answering incorrectly. While recent AVQA models have high accuracy, their ability to identify when they are likely wrong and their consequent abstention from answering remain underexplored areas of research. To fill this gap, we explore several approaches and then propose Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR), a lightweight method to further enhance the performance of $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA. Our key insight is that the Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) is Bayes-optimal only under strong calibration, a condition usually not met in deep neural networks, particularly in multimodal models. Instead of replacing MSP, our ACR maintains it as a primary confidence signal and applies input-adaptive residual corrections when MSP is deemed unreliable. ACR introduces two learned heads: i) a Residual Risk Head that predicts low-magnitude correctness residuals that MSP does not capture, and ii) a Confidence Gating Head to determine MSP trustworthiness. Our experiments and theoretical analysis show that ACR consistently outperforms existing methods on in- and out-of-disrtibution, and data bias settings across three different AVQA architectures, establishing a solid foundation for $\mathcal{R}$-AVQA task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STIR is a framework that internalizes chain-of-thought reasoning into dynamic latent trajectory control, improving accuracy while reducing token consumption compared to vanilla decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing activation steering methods use static control vectors that can't adapt to the non-stationary evolution of complex reasoning tasks, limiting their effectiveness for internalizing reasoning processes.

Method: STIR uses a three-stage pipeline: (1) differential intrinsic action induction to harvest latent reasoning successes, (2) sparse control basis construction to create a compact tool library, and (3) value-modulated trajectory intervention with anchor-based gating for dynamic control.

Result: On six arithmetic and logical benchmarks across four models, STIR improves average accuracy by 1.9% to 7.5% while reducing average token consumption by up to 35% compared to vanilla decoding.

Conclusion: The benefits of explicit chain-of-thought can be realized through dynamic latent trajectory control, internalizing reasoning processes to bypass explicit generation while achieving superior fidelity.

Abstract: The internalization of chain-of-thought processes into hidden states has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm for scaling test-time compute. However, existing activation steering methods rely on static control vectors that fail to adapt to the non-stationary evolution of complex reasoning tasks. To address this limitation, we propose STIR (Self-Distilled Tools for Internal Reasoning), a framework that reformulates reasoning enhancement as a dynamic latent trajectory control problem. STIR introduces a synergistic three-stage pipeline: (1) differential intrinsic action induction harvests latent reasoning successes to crystallize steering primitives; (2) sparse control basis construction curates a compact, geometrically diverse tool library; and (3) value-modulated trajectory intervention dynamically injects context-specific impulses via anchor-based gating. Extensive experiments on six arithmetic and logical benchmarks across four representative models demonstrate that STIR improves average accuracy by 1.9% to 7.5% while reducing average token consumption by up to 35% compared to vanilla decoding. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of explicit chain-of-thought can be realized through dynamic latent trajectory control, internalizing the reasoning process to bypass the explicit generation while achieving superior fidelity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Euphonium is a new RL framework for aligning flow matching models with human preferences that uses process reward gradient guidance to steer generation, overcoming inefficient exploration in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current online RL approaches for aligning flow matching models suffer from inefficient exploration during training rollouts, relying on undirected stochasticity and sparse outcome rewards, which leads to poor discovery of high-reward samples and slow optimization.

Method: Formulates sampling as a Stochastic Differential Equation incorporating Process Reward Model gradients into flow drift; uses Dual-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization combining latent process rewards for credit assignment with pixel-level outcome rewards for visual fidelity; includes distillation to internalize guidance into flow network.

Result: Achieves better alignment than existing methods in text-to-video generation while accelerating training convergence by 1.66x.

Conclusion: Euphonium provides a principled framework for efficient exploration in RL-based alignment of flow matching models, theoretically encompassing existing methods as special cases while enabling dense, step-by-step steering toward high-reward regions.

Abstract: While online Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning flow matching models with human preferences, current approaches are hindered by inefficient exploration during training rollouts. Relying on undirected stochasticity and sparse outcome rewards, these methods struggle to discover high-reward samples, resulting in data-inefficient and slow optimization. To address these limitations, we propose Euphonium, a novel framework that steers generation via process reward gradient guided dynamics. Our key insight is to formulate the sampling process as a theoretically principled Stochastic Differential Equation that explicitly incorporates the gradient of a Process Reward Model into the flow drift. This design enables dense, step-by-step steering toward high-reward regions, advancing beyond the unguided exploration in prior works, and theoretically encompasses existing sampling methods (e.g., Flow-GRPO, DanceGRPO) as special cases. We further derive a distillation objective that internalizes the guidance signal into the flow network, eliminating inference-time dependency on the reward model. We instantiate this framework with a Dual-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, combining latent process rewards for efficient credit assignment with pixel-level outcome rewards for final visual fidelity. Experiments on text-to-video generation show that Euphonium achieves better alignment compared to existing methods while accelerating training convergence by 1.66x.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TurboBoA is a fast backpropagation-free PTQ method that accelerates BoA by 3x+ while improving accuracy through joint channel quantization, error correction, and adaptive refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PTQ methods have trade-offs: GPTQ is efficient but inaccurate at low bits due to layer independence assumption; BoA improves accuracy by considering inter-layer dependencies but is inefficient due to sequential quantization across all out-channels.

Method: TurboBoA introduces three innovations: 1) joint quantization of multiple out-channels with closed-form error compensation for speedup, 2) correction mechanism for errors from preceding quantized layers, and 3) adaptive grid computation with coordinate descent refinement for alignment during iterative updates.

Result: TurboBoA achieves more than 3x speedup over BoA while consistently improving accuracy. When combined with outlier suppression, it achieves SOTA results in both weight-only and weight-activation quantization.

Conclusion: TurboBoA successfully addresses the efficiency-accuracy trade-off in PTQ by preserving BoA's accuracy benefits while significantly accelerating the quantization process through novel joint quantization and error correction techniques.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the importance of post-training quantization (PTQ) for reducing memory and computation costs. Among PTQ methods, GPTQ has gained significant attention for its efficiency, enabling billion-scale LLMs to be quantized within a few GPU hours. However, GPTQ's assumption of layer-wise independence leads to severe accuracy drops in low-bit regimes. Recently, BoA improved upon GPTQ by incorporating inter-layer dependencies within attention modules, but its reliance on sequential quantization across all out-channels makes it substantially less efficient. In this paper, we propose TurboBoA, a new backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that preserves the accuracy benefits of BoA while significantly accelerating the process. The proposed TurboBoA introduces three key innovations: (i) joint quantization of multiple out-channels with a closed-form error compensation rule, which reduces sequential bottlenecks and yields more than a three-fold speedup; (ii) a correction mechanism for errors propagated from preceding quantized layers; and (iii) adaptive grid computation with coordinate descent refinement to maintain alignment during iterative updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TurboBoA delivers substantial acceleration over BoA while consistently improving accuracy. When combined with outlier suppression techniques, it achieves state-of-the-art results in both weight-only and weight-activation quantization.

TL;DR: Decoder-only LLMs transition from context processing to prediction forming across layers, with late layers implementing a structured geometric code that enables selective causal control over token predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how decoder-only large language models transform contextual information into token predictions, specifically examining the computational phases and representational geometry changes across model depth.

Method: A unified framework combining geometric analysis with mechanistic intervention to study representation geometry and causal control in decoder-only LLMs across different layers.

Result: Late-layer representations implement a structured geometric code: angular organization parametrizes prediction distributional similarity, while representation norms encode context-specific information that doesn't determine prediction. Models show depth-wise transition from context-processing to prediction-forming phases.

Conclusion: The study provides a mechanistic-geometric account of how LLMs transform context into predictions, revealing that angular geometry controls prediction similarity while norms carry contextual information, enabling selective causal control over token generation.

Abstract: We show that decoder-only large language models exhibit a depth-wise transition from context-processing to prediction-forming phases of computation accompanied by a reorganization of representational geometry. Using a unified framework combining geometric analysis with mechanistic intervention, we demonstrate that late-layer representations implement a structured geometric code that enables selective causal control over token prediction. Specifically, angular organization of the representation geometry parametrizes prediction distributional similarity, while representation norms encode context-specific information that does not determine prediction. Together, these results provide a mechanistic-geometric account of the dynamics of transforming context into predictions in LLMs.

*Davide Berasi,Matteo Farina,Massimiliano Mancini,Elisa Ricci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Model merging of domain-specific multimodal experts serves as an efficient proxy for evaluating data mixture performance, enabling optimal mixture selection without expensive training runs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data mixture optimization for multimodal LLMs is computationally expensive due to combinatorial search space and high training costs, while model merging offers efficiency but often yields suboptimal results.

Method: Train domain-specific multimodal experts, then evaluate weighted parameter-space combinations of these experts to estimate performance of corresponding data mixtures.

Result: Merged proxy models show high rank correlation with models trained on actual data mixtures across 14 multimodal benchmarks, enabling efficient mixture optimization.

Conclusion: Model merging provides a scalable, efficient strategy for data mixture optimization by decoupling mixture search from resource-intensive training processes.

Abstract: Selecting the best data mixture is critical for successful Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, determining the optimal mixture weights across multiple domain-specific datasets remains a significant bottleneck due to the combinatorial search space and the high cost associated with even a single training run. This is the so-called Data Mixture Optimization (DMO) problem. On the other hand, model merging unifies domain-specific experts through parameter interpolation. This strategy is efficient, as it only requires a single training run per domain, yet oftentimes leads to suboptimal models. In this work, we take the best of both worlds, studying model merging as an efficient strategy for estimating the performance of different data mixtures. We train domain-specific multimodal experts and evaluate their weighted parameter-space combinations to estimate the efficacy of corresponding data mixtures. We conduct extensive experiments on 14 multimodal benchmarks, and empirically demonstrate that the merged proxy models exhibit a high rank correlation with models trained on actual data mixtures. This decouples the search for optimal mixtures from the resource-intensive training process, thereby providing a scalable and efficient strategy for navigating the complex landscape of mixture weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural PDE solvers struggle with industrial-scale geometries (over 10^8 cells) due to prohibitive memory complexity when processing high-resolution meshes, creating a gap between GPU capacity and engineering resolution requirements.

Method: Introduces two key architectural optimizations: 1) faster slice and deslice using matrix multiplication associative property, and 2) geometry slice tiling to partition physical state computation. Also uses amortized training on random mesh subsets and physical state caching during inference.

Result: Transolver-3 successfully handles meshes with over 160 million cells and demonstrates impressive performance across three challenging simulation benchmarks including aircraft and automotive design tasks.

Conclusion: Transolver-3 bridges the scalability gap for neural PDE solvers, enabling high-fidelity physics simulations on industrial-scale geometries that were previously infeasible due to memory constraints.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a transformative tool for the neural surrogate modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. However, scaling these solvers to industrial-scale geometries with over $10^8$ cells remains a fundamental challenge due to the prohibitive memory complexity of processing high-resolution meshes. We present Transolver-3, a new member of the Transolver family as a highly scalable framework designed for high-fidelity physics simulations. To bridge the gap between limited GPU capacity and the resolution requirements of complex engineering tasks, we introduce two key architectural optimizations: faster slice and deslice by exploiting matrix multiplication associative property and geometry slice tiling to partition the computation of physical states. Combined with an amortized training strategy by learning on random subsets of original high-resolution meshes and a physical state caching technique during inference, Transolver-3 enables high-fidelity field prediction on industrial-scale meshes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Transolver-3 is capable of handling meshes with over 160 million cells, achieving impressive performance across three challenging simulation benchmarks, including aircraft and automotive design tasks.

*Tomas Tokar,Scott Sanner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Neuralized Kolmogorov Mean (NKM) and quasi-arithmetic neural networks (QUANNs) as learnable aggregation functions for sets, outperforming fixed pooling methods like sum/max and improving transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed, non-learnable pooling operations (sum, max) in set models like DeepSets and PointNet hinder transferability of learned embeddings and limit model expressivity. Need more expressive, learnable aggregation functions.

Method: Introduces Neuralized Kolmogorov Mean (NKM) - a trainable framework for learning generalized central tendency via invertible neural function. Proposes quasi-arithmetic neural networks (QUANNs) incorporating NKM as learnable aggregation function.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows QUANNs are universal approximators for broad class of set-function decompositions. Empirically, QUANNs outperform state-of-the-art baselines across diverse benchmarks and learn embeddings that transfer effectively even to non-set tasks.

Conclusion: NKM and QUANNs provide superior learnable aggregation for set-structured data, offering better expressivity, theoretical guarantees, and improved transfer learning compared to fixed pooling methods.

Abstract: Sets represent a fundamental abstraction across many types of data. To handle the unordered nature of set-structured data, models such as DeepSets and PointNet rely on fixed, non-learnable pooling operations (e.g., sum or max) -- a design choice that can hinder the transferability of learned embeddings and limits model expressivity. More recently, learnable aggregation functions have been proposed as more expressive alternatives. In this work, we advance this line of research by introducing the Neuralized Kolmogorov Mean (NKM) -- a novel, trainable framework for learning a generalized measure of central tendency through an invertible neural function. We further propose quasi-arithmetic neural networks (QUANNs), which incorporate the NKM as a learnable aggregation function. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that, QUANNs are universal approximators for a broad class of common set-function decompositions and, thanks to their invertible neural components, learn more structured latent representations. Empirically, QUANNs outperform state-of-the-art baselines across diverse benchmarks, while learning embeddings that transfer effectively even to tasks that do not involve sets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: π-Distill and OPSD methods effectively distill frontier agents using only action trajectories as privileged information, outperforming standard supervised finetuning + RL approaches that require full Chain-of-Thought supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transferring capabilities learned with privileged information (PI) to policies that must act without it at inference time is challenging, especially when distilling frontier models where only action trajectories are observable but internal reasoning is hidden.

Method: Two approaches: 1) π-Distill - joint teacher-student objective training PI-conditioned teacher and unconditioned student simultaneously; 2) On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD) - RL with reverse KL-penalty between student and PI-conditioned teacher.

Result: Both algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. π-Distill and sometimes OPSD outperform industry standard practices (supervised finetuning + RL) across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI.

Conclusion: π-Distill and OPSD enable effective knowledge transfer from privileged information to inference-time policies, providing practical solutions for distilling frontier agents when only action trajectories are available.

Abstract: Training-time privileged information (PI) can enable language models to succeed on tasks they would otherwise fail, making it a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in hard, long-horizon settings. However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce π-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that π-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on π-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.

*José Afonso,Vasco Guerra,Pedro Viegas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A stochastic hierarchical optimization framework using reduced Hessian approximation for efficient calibration of physical models, validated on plasma-surface interaction problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical model calibration is computationally expensive due to high-dimensional parameter spaces and anisotropic landscapes. Traditional methods require exhaustive sampling, which is impractical for complex systems like plasma-surface interactions where uncertainties in surface reactivity parameters and high computational costs of kinetic simulations limit accurate modeling.

Method: The framework uses a reduced Hessian approximation inspired by Sloppy Model theory to identify and target the stiff parameter subspace with minimal simulation queries. It integrates a probabilistic formulation that derives a principled objective loss function directly from observed data, enabling efficient navigation of highly anisotropic landscapes.

Result: The method consistently outperforms baseline optimization techniques in sample efficiency when applied to plasma-surface interaction problems. It provides a general and scalable tool for optimizing complex reaction system models.

Conclusion: The stochastic hierarchical optimization framework offers an efficient approach for calibrating physical models by focusing computational resources on the most sensitive parameter directions, making it applicable to diverse complex systems from plasma chemistry to biochemical networks.

Abstract: This work introduces a stochastic hierarchical optimization framework inspired by Sloppy Model theory for the efficient calibration of physical models. Central to this method is the use of a reduced Hessian approximation, which identifies and targets the stiff parameter subspace using minimal simulation queries. This strategy enables efficient navigation of highly anisotropic landscapes, avoiding the computational burden of exhaustive sampling. To ensure rigorous inference, we integrate this approach with a probabilistic formulation that derives a principled objective loss function directly from observed data. We validate the framework by applying it to the problem of plasma-surface interactions, where accurate modelling is strictly limited by uncertainties in surface reactivity parameters and the computational cost of kinetic simulations. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms baseline optimization techniques in sample efficiency. This approach offers a general and scalable tool for optimizing models of complex reaction systems, ranging from plasma chemistry to biochemical networks.

### [197] [ReFORM: Reflected Flows for On-support Offline RL via Noise Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05051)
*Songyuan Zhang,Oswin So,H. M. Sabbir Ahmad,Eric Yang Yu,Matthew Cleaveland,Mitchell Black,Chuchu Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReFORM is an offline RL method using flow policies with bounded source distributions to enforce support constraints, preventing OOD errors while maintaining policy expressiveness for multimodal distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL faces two key challenges: 1) OOD errors when policies leave training distribution, and existing methods using statistical distance penalties constrain policy improvement and may not fully prevent OOD actions; 2) Difficulty representing multimodal optimal policy distributions, where diffusion/flow policies help but don't address OOD avoidance.

Method: ReFORM learns a behavior cloning flow policy with bounded source distribution to capture action distribution support, then optimizes a reflected flow that generates bounded noise for the BC flow while maintaining support constraints to maximize performance.

Result: Across 40 challenging OGBench tasks with varying dataset quality and using constant hyperparameters for all tasks, ReFORM dominates all baselines with hand-tuned hyperparameters on performance profile curves.

Conclusion: ReFORM effectively addresses OOD errors in offline RL by enforcing support constraints through flow policies with bounded source distributions, achieving superior performance while maintaining policy expressiveness for multimodal distributions.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn the optimal policy from a fixed dataset generated by behavior policies without additional environment interactions. One common challenge that arises in this setting is the out-of-distribution (OOD) error, which occurs when the policy leaves the training distribution. Prior methods penalize a statistical distance term to keep the policy close to the behavior policy, but this constrains policy improvement and may not completely prevent OOD actions. Another challenge is that the optimal policy distribution can be multimodal and difficult to represent. Recent works apply diffusion or flow policies to address this problem, but it is unclear how to avoid OOD errors while retaining policy expressiveness. We propose ReFORM, an offline RL method based on flow policies that enforces the less restrictive support constraint by construction. ReFORM learns a behavior cloning (BC) flow policy with a bounded source distribution to capture the support of the action distribution, then optimizes a reflected flow that generates bounded noise for the BC flow while keeping the support, to maximize the performance. Across 40 challenging tasks from the OGBench benchmark with datasets of varying quality and using a constant set of hyperparameters for all tasks, ReFORM dominates all baselines with hand-tuned hyperparameters on the performance profile curves.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical online matching algorithms in domains like Internet advertising and organ allocation often lack strong theoretical guarantees, creating a gap between data-driven heuristics and theoretical bounds.

Method: Develop new online matching algorithms based on coarsening approach that aggregates offline nodes into capacitated clusters, then apply methodology to heart transplant allocation using structural properties of historical data.

Result: The coarsening approach yields near-optimal theoretical guarantees; in realistic simulations for heart transplant allocation, the policy closely matches the performance of the omniscient benchmark.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap between data-driven heuristics and pessimistic theoretical lower bounds, providing rigorous justification for prior clustering-based approaches in organ allocation.

Abstract: Online matching has been a mainstay in domains such as Internet advertising and organ allocation, but practical algorithms often lack strong theoretical guarantees. We take an important step toward addressing this by developing new online matching algorithms based on a coarsening approach. Although coarsening typically implies a loss of granularity, we show that, to the contrary, aggregating offline nodes into capacitated clusters can yield near-optimal theoretical guarantees. We apply our methodology to heart transplant allocation to develop theoretically grounded policies based on structural properties of historical data. In realistic simulations, our policy closely matches the performance of the omniscient benchmark. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven heuristics and pessimistic theoretical lower bounds, and provides rigorous justification for prior clustering-based approaches in organ allocation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that current organ allocation systems overlook incentive problems, treating allocation as a static optimization rather than a complex game involving strategic actors, and calls for incentive-aware policies using mechanism design and related tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current organ allocation approaches are transitioning from rule-based systems to ML/data-driven optimization, but they overlook fundamental incentive barriers. Organ allocation is not just a static optimization problem but a complex game involving transplant centers, clinicians, and regulators with misaligned incentives that cause adverse consequences.

Method: Position paper analyzing US adult heart transplant allocation, identifying critical incentive misalignments across the decision-making pipeline using data analysis. Proposes a research agenda integrating mechanism design, strategic classification, causal inference, and social choice theory.

Result: The paper presents data showing that incentive misalignments are having adverse consequences in current organ allocation systems, particularly in US adult heart transplant allocation.

Conclusion: The next generation of organ allocation policies should be incentive-aware. The machine learning community should integrate tools from mechanism design, strategic classification, causal inference, and social choice to ensure robustness, efficiency, and fairness in allocation systems that account for strategic behavior.

Abstract: The allocation of scarce donor organs constitutes one of the most consequential algorithmic challenges in healthcare. While the field is rapidly transitioning from rigid, rule-based systems to machine learning and data-driven optimization, we argue that current approaches often overlook a fundamental barrier: incentives. In this position paper, we highlight that organ allocation is not merely a static optimization problem, but rather a complex game involving transplant centers, clinicians, and regulators. Focusing on US adult heart transplant allocation, we identify critical incentive misalignments across the decision-making pipeline, and present data showing that they are having adverse consequences today. Our main position is that the next generation of allocation policies should be incentive aware. We outline a research agenda for the machine learning community, calling for the integration of mechanism design, strategic classification, causal inference, and social choice to ensure robustness, efficiency, and fairness in the face of strategic behavior from the various constituent groups.

*Yu-Ang Lee,Ching-Yun Ko,Pin-Yu Chen,Mi-Yen Yeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Vanilla LoRA remains competitive with newer variants when learning rates are properly tuned; reported improvements often stem from suboptimal hyperparameter comparisons rather than consistent methodological advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies propose various LoRA variants claiming substantial improvements over vanilla LoRA, but these gains are often demonstrated under fixed or narrowly tuned hyperparameter settings, despite known neural network sensitivity to training configurations.

Method: Systematically re-evaluated four representative LoRA variants alongside vanilla LoRA through extensive hyperparameter searches across mathematical and code generation tasks on diverse model scales, with second-order analysis of Hessian eigenvalues.

Result: Different LoRA methods favor distinct learning rate ranges; once learning rates are properly tuned, all methods achieve similar peak performance (within 1-2%), with only subtle rank-dependent behaviors. Vanilla LoRA remains competitive.

Conclusion: Vanilla LoRA remains a competitive baseline, and improvements reported under single training configuration may not reflect consistent methodological advantages. Second-order analysis attributes differing optimal learning rate ranges to variations in the largest Hessian eigenvalue.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is the prevailing approach for efficient large language model (LLM) fine-tuning. Building on this paradigm, recent studies have proposed alternative initialization strategies and architectural modifications, reporting substantial improvements over vanilla LoRA. However, these gains are often demonstrated under fixed or narrowly tuned hyperparameter settings, despite the known sensitivity of neural networks to training configurations. In this work, we systematically re-evaluate four representative LoRA variants alongside vanilla LoRA through extensive hyperparameter searches. Across mathematical and code generation tasks on diverse model scales, we find that different LoRA methods favor distinct learning rate ranges. Crucially, once learning rates are properly tuned, all methods achieve similar peak performance (within 1-2%), with only subtle rank-dependent behaviors. These results suggest that vanilla LoRA remains a competitive baseline and that improvements reported under single training configuration may not reflect consistent methodological advantages. Finally, a second-order analysis attributes the differing optimal learning rate ranges to variations in the largest Hessian eigenvalue, aligning with classical learning theories.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EntRGi: A novel entropy-aware reward guidance method for discrete diffusion language models that dynamically regulates reward gradients to overcome limitations of existing continuous relaxation and straight-through estimator approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward guidance methods for discrete diffusion language models have significant limitations: continuous relaxation approaches degrade gradient feedback because reward models aren't trained on continuous inputs, while straight-through estimators involve incorrect optimization by using gradients evaluated at discrete tokens to update continuous logits.

Method: EntRGi (Entropy aware Reward Guidance) introduces a novel mechanism that dynamically regulates gradients from reward models by modulating the continuous relaxation using the model's confidence. This approach provides reliable inputs to reward models while improving reward guidance.

Result: Empirical validation on a 7B-parameter diffusion language model across 3 diverse reward models and 3 multi-skill benchmarks shows consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: EntRGi successfully addresses the fundamental tradeoff in reward guidance for discrete diffusion language models by introducing entropy-aware gradient regulation, providing a more effective approach than existing methods.

Abstract: Reward guidance has been applied to great success in the test-time adaptation of continuous diffusion models; it updates each denoising step using the gradients from a downstream reward model. We study reward guidance for discrete diffusion language models, where one cannot differentiate through the natural outputs of the model because they are discrete tokens. Existing approaches either replace these discrete tokens with continuous relaxations, or employ techniques like the straight-through estimator. In this work, we show the downsides of both these methods. The former degrades gradient feedback because the reward model has never been trained with continuous inputs. The latter involves incorrect optimization because the gradient evaluated at discrete tokens is used to update continuous logits. Our key innovation is to go beyond this tradeoff by introducing a novel mechanism called EntRGi: Entropy aware Reward Guidance that dynamically regulates the gradients from the reward model. By modulating the continuous relaxation using the model's confidence, our approach substantially improves reward guidance while providing reliable inputs to the reward model. We empirically validate our approach on a 7B-parameter diffusion language model across 3 diverse reward models and 3 multi-skill benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Proposes robust neural Lyapunov barrier certificates for verifying safety and stability of RL controllers under dynamic perturbations, using adversarial training and Lipschitz regularization to improve certified robustness bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural Lyapunov/barrier certificates only guarantee safety/stability under ideal unperturbed dynamics, limiting reliability in real-world applications where system dynamics may deviate due to uncertainties.

Method: Defines robust Lyapunov barrier functions with sufficient conditions based on Lipschitz continuity. Proposes training objectives enforcing these conditions via adversarial training, Lipschitz neighborhood bound, and global Lipschitz regularization.

Result: Significantly improves certified robustness bounds (up to 4.6×) and empirical success rates under strong perturbations (up to 2.4×) compared to baseline in Inverted Pendulum and 2D Docking environments.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness of training robust neural certificates for safe reinforcement learning under perturbations in dynamics, addressing a critical limitation of existing methods for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Neural Lyapunov and barrier certificates have recently been used as powerful tools for verifying the safety and stability properties of deep reinforcement learning (RL) controllers. However, existing methods offer guarantees only under fixed ideal unperturbed dynamics, limiting their reliability in real-world applications where dynamics may deviate due to uncertainties. In this work, we study the problem of synthesizing \emph{robust neural Lyapunov barrier certificates} that maintain their guarantees under perturbations in system dynamics. We formally define a robust Lyapunov barrier function and specify sufficient conditions based on Lipschitz continuity that ensure robustness against bounded perturbations. We propose practical training objectives that enforce these conditions via adversarial training, Lipschitz neighborhood bound, and global Lipschitz regularization. We validate our approach in two practically relevant environments, Inverted Pendulum and 2D Docking. The former is a widely studied benchmark, while the latter is a safety-critical task in autonomous systems. We show that our methods significantly improve both certified robustness bounds (up to $4.6$ times) and empirical success rates under strong perturbations (up to $2.4$ times) compared to the baseline. Our results demonstrate effectiveness of training robust neural certificates for safe RL under perturbations in dynamics.

### [204] [Private PoEtry: Private In-Context Learning via Product of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05012)
*Rob Romijnders,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Jonathan Petit,Max Welling,Christos Louizos,Yuki M. Asano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new differential privacy framework for in-context learning that reformulates private ICL as a Product-of-Experts model, achieving significant accuracy improvements over prior methods while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-context learning enables LLMs to adapt to new tasks without fine-tuning, but in-context examples may contain privacy-sensitive information. Existing DP approaches to ICL are either computationally expensive or rely on heuristics with limited effectiveness.

Method: Reformulate private ICL through the lens of a Product-of-Experts model, creating a theoretically grounded framework that can be trivially parallelized.

Result: The method improves accuracy by more than 30 percentage points on average compared to prior DP-ICL methods across five datasets in text classification, math, and vision-language tasks, while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: The proposed Product-of-Experts framework provides an effective and efficient solution for private in-context learning, significantly outperforming existing approaches while preserving privacy.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks with only a small set of examples at inference time, thereby avoiding task-specific fine-tuning. However, in-context examples may contain privacy-sensitive information that should not be revealed through model outputs. Existing differential privacy (DP) approaches to ICL are either computationally expensive or rely on heuristics with limited effectiveness, including context oversampling, synthetic data generation, or unnecessary thresholding. We reformulate private ICL through the lens of a Product-of-Experts model. This gives a theoretically grounded framework, and the algorithm can be trivially parallelized. We evaluate our method across five datasets in text classification, math, and vision-language. We find that our method improves accuracy by more than 30 percentage points on average compared to prior DP-ICL methods, while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.

*Dhruv Sarkar,Abhishek Sinha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a modular algorithm for constrained contextual bandits with adversarial contexts that reduces the constrained problem to unconstrained bandits using online regression oracles and surrogate rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most prior work on constrained contextual bandits (CCB) focuses on stochastic contexts, but real-world scenarios often involve adversarial contexts. There's a need for algorithms that handle adversarial contexts while controlling both regret and cumulative constraint violation in the continuing setting.

Method: Builds on SquareCB framework, uses online regression oracles to reduce constrained problem to standard unconstrained contextual bandits with adaptively defined surrogate reward functions. Operates in continuing setting where algorithm continues even after budget exhaustion.

Result: Achieves improved guarantees for adversarial context setting compared to prior work focused on stochastic contexts. Provides compact and transparent analysis through modular reduction approach.

Conclusion: Proposes a simple, modular algorithmic scheme that handles adversarial contexts in constrained contextual bandits, offering better theoretical guarantees and cleaner analysis than existing approaches.

Abstract: We study constrained contextual bandits (CCB) with adversarially chosen contexts, where each action yields a random reward and incurs a random cost. We adopt the standard realizability assumption: conditioned on the observed context, rewards and costs are drawn independently from fixed distributions whose expectations belong to known function classes. We consider the continuing setting, in which the algorithm operates over the entire horizon even after the budget is exhausted. In this setting, the objective is to simultaneously control regret and cumulative constraint violation. Building on the seminal SquareCB framework of Foster et al. (2018), we propose a simple and modular algorithmic scheme that leverages online regression oracles to reduce the constrained problem to a standard unconstrained contextual bandit problem with adaptively defined surrogate reward functions. In contrast to most prior work on CCB, which focuses on stochastic contexts, our reduction yields improved guarantees for the more general adversarial context setting, together with a compact and transparent analysis.

*Dikshant Shehmar,Matthew Schlegel,Matthew E. Taylor,Marlos C. Machado*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALPS uses Laplacian representations for hierarchical planning in model-based RL, outperforming baselines on offline goal-conditioned tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planning with learned models is challenging in model-based RL. State representations must support local cost computation while preserving long-horizon structure. Existing methods struggle with compounding errors over long prediction horizons.

Method: ALPS (hierarchical planning algorithm) uses Laplacian representations that capture state-space distances at multiple time scales. This representation preserves meaningful distances, decomposes long-horizon problems into subgoals, and mitigates compounding errors.

Result: ALPS outperforms commonly used baselines on offline goal-conditioned RL tasks from OGBench, a benchmark previously dominated by model-free methods.

Conclusion: Laplacian representations provide an effective latent space for planning in model-based RL, enabling hierarchical decomposition and mitigating long-horizon prediction errors, making them suitable for decision-time planning.

Abstract: Planning with a learned model remains a key challenge in model-based reinforcement learning (RL). In decision-time planning, state representations are critical as they must support local cost computation while preserving long-horizon structure. In this paper, we show that the Laplacian representation provides an effective latent space for planning by capturing state-space distances at multiple time scales. This representation preserves meaningful distances and naturally decomposes long-horizon problems into subgoals, also mitigating the compounding errors that arise over long prediction horizons. Building on these properties, we introduce ALPS, a hierarchical planning algorithm, and demonstrate that it outperforms commonly used baselines on a selection of offline goal-conditioned RL tasks from OGBench, a benchmark previously dominated by model-free methods.

*Jiaxu Ren,Yixin Wang,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes using MUTATE framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous causal representation learning methods focus on i.i.d. or discrete-time processes, but many real-world applications require modeling continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes in genomics and neuroscience).

Method: Developed MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics. Analyzed identifiability by examining geometry of parameter space.

Result: MUTATE effectively answers scientific questions in simulated and empirical studies, including mutation accumulation in genomics and neuron spike trigger mechanisms in response to time-varying dynamics.

Conclusion: The framework enables identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes, addressing limitations of previous methods and demonstrating practical applications in scientific domains.

Abstract: Learning meaningful causal representations from observations has emerged as a crucial task for facilitating machine learning applications and driving scientific discoveries in fields such as climate science, biology, and physics. This process involves disentangling high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level observations. Previous work in this area that achieves identifiability typically focuses on cases where the observations are either i.i.d. or follow a latent discrete-time process. Nevertheless, many real-world settings require identifying latent variables that are continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes). To this end, we develop identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes. We study its identifiability by analyzing the geometry of the parameter space. Furthermore, we develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics. Across simulated and empirical studies, we find that MUTATE can effectively answer scientific questions, such as the accumulation of mutations in genomics and the mechanisms driving neuron spike triggers in response to time-varying dynamics.

*Roger Girgis,Rodrigue de Schaetzen,Luke Rowe,Azalée Robitaille,Christopher Pal,Liam Paull*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Constrained GRPO extends GRPO for constrained policy optimization using Lagrangian relaxation with indicator cost functions, fixing advantage estimation issues that break constraint learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While GRPO is scalable for critic-free policy learning, it lacks support for explicit behavioral constraints. Many real-world applications (especially robotics and embodied AI) require constraint satisfaction alongside reward maximization.

Method: Constrained GRPO uses Lagrangian relaxation with indicator cost functions to directly optimize violation rates. Key innovation is scalarized advantage construction that preserves proper trade-off between reward and constraint terms, fixing issues where multi-component advantage estimation distorts Lagrangian signals.

Result: Experiments in toy gridworld confirm the predicted optimization pathology and show scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control. In robotics tasks, Constrained GRPO improves constraint satisfaction while increasing task success.

Conclusion: Constrained GRPO provides a simple and effective recipe for constrained policy optimization in embodied AI domains that increasingly rely on large multimodal foundation models, enabling scalable constraint-aware learning.

Abstract: While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable framework for critic-free policy learning, extending it to settings with explicit behavioral constraints remains underexplored. We introduce Constrained GRPO, a Lagrangian-based extension of GRPO for constrained policy optimization. Constraints are specified via indicator cost functions, enabling direct optimization of violation rates through a Lagrangian relaxation. We show that a naive multi-component treatment in advantage estimation can break constrained learning: mismatched component-wise standard deviations distort the relative importance of the different objective terms, which in turn corrupts the Lagrangian signal and prevents meaningful constraint enforcement. We formally derive this effect to motivate our scalarized advantage construction that preserves the intended trade-off between reward and constraint terms. Experiments in a toy gridworld confirm the predicted optimization pathology and demonstrate that scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control. In addition, we evaluate Constrained GRPO on robotics tasks, where it improves constraint satisfaction while increasing task success, establishing a simple and effective recipe for constrained policy optimization in embodied AI domains that increasingly rely on large multimodal foundation models.

*Karish Grover,Theodore Vasiloudis,Han Xie,Sixing Lu,Xiang Song,Christos Faloutsos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ControlG: A control-theoretic framework for coordinating multiple self-supervised learning objectives on graphs by temporal allocation rather than per-update mixing, addressing objective interference and training instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-task graph SSL methods suffer from objective interference and training instability when combining multiple pretext objectives (mutual information, reconstruction, contrastive learning). Traditional per-update mixing forces compromises that lead to three failure modes: Disagreement (conflict-induced negative transfer), Drift (nonstationary objective utility), and Drought (hidden starvation of underserved objectives).

Method: ControlG recasts multi-objective graph SSL as feedback-controlled temporal allocation. It estimates per-objective difficulty and pairwise antagonism, plans target budgets via a Pareto-aware log-hypervolume planner, and schedules optimization using a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller to decide when each objective receives optimization budget rather than how to weigh them.

Result: Across 9 datasets, ControlG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while producing an auditable schedule that reveals which objectives drove learning.

Conclusion: Coordination in multi-task graph SSL is fundamentally a temporal allocation problem, and ControlG's control-theoretic approach effectively addresses objective interference by intelligently scheduling when each objective receives optimization attention rather than forcing compromises in every update.

Abstract: Can multi-task self-supervised learning on graphs be coordinated without the usual tug-of-war between objectives? Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a growing toolbox of pretext objectives: mutual information, reconstruction, contrastive learning; yet combining them reliably remains a challenge due to objective interference and training instability. Most multi-pretext pipelines use per-update mixing, forcing every parameter update to be a compromise, leading to three failure modes: Disagreement (conflict-induced negative transfer), Drift (nonstationary objective utility), and Drought (hidden starvation of underserved objectives). We argue that coordination is fundamentally a temporal allocation problem: deciding when each objective receives optimization budget, not merely how to weigh them. We introduce ControlG, a control-theoretic framework that recasts multi-objective graph SSL as feedback-controlled temporal allocation by estimating per-objective difficulty and pairwise antagonism, planning target budgets via a Pareto-aware log-hypervolume planner, and scheduling with a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Across 9 datasets, ControlG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, while producing an auditable schedule that reveals which objectives drove learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework that efficiently handles numerical PDE solving, constrained optimization, and physics-informed learning for variational PDEs, addressing computational efficiency challenges across these applications.

Method: Based on Galerkin discretization with novel TensorGalerkin framework that tensorizes element-wise operations and performs global reduction via sparse matrix multiplication on mesh-induced sparsity graphs, enabling GPU acceleration and seamless integration for multiple downstream applications.

Result: Demonstrated significant computational efficiency and accuracy gains over various baselines for 2D/3D elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs on unstructured meshes across all targeted applications.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework provides an efficient, versatile solution for variational PDE problems across numerical solving, optimization, and learning applications with demonstrated performance advantages.

Abstract: We present a unified algorithmic framework for the numerical solution, constrained optimization, and physics-informed learning of PDEs with a variational structure. Our framework is based on a Galerkin discretization of the underlying variational forms, and its high efficiency stems from a novel highly-optimized and GPU-compliant TensorGalerkin framework for linear system assembly (stiffness matrices and load vectors). TensorGalerkin operates by tensorizing element-wise operations within a Python-level Map stage and then performs global reduction with a sparse matrix multiplication that performs message passing on the mesh-induced sparsity graph. It can be seamlessly employed downstream as i) a highly-efficient numerical PDEs solver, ii) an end-to-end differentiable framework for PDE-constrained optimization, and iii) a physics-informed operator learning algorithm for PDEs. With multiple benchmarks, including 2D and 3D elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDEs on unstructured meshes, we demonstrate that the proposed framework provides significant computational efficiency and accuracy gains over a variety of baselines in all the targeted downstream applications.

*Wen Zhang,Adel W. Sadek,Chunming Qiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid predictive framework recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeways using CV and weather data, combining machine learning with physics-based safety constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inclement weather reduces driver visibility and tire-road friction, increasing crash risk. Current speed recommendations may not adapt dynamically to real-time weather conditions, necessitating a data-driven approach to provide safer speed guidance.

Method: Uses high-resolution Connected Vehicle and Road Weather Information System data to create spatiotemporal dataset. Employs Quantile Regression Forests to predict speed distributions, then applies physics-based upper speed limits based on road grip and visibility constraints. Fuses QRF predictions with posted speed limits and physics-derived bounds.

Result: QRF model achieves MAE of 1.55 mph, with 96.43% of median predictions within 5 mph, PICP(50%) of 48.55%. Model shows strong generalization across weather types and road segments, responding effectively to changing conditions.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework successfully provides real-time safe speed recommendations that adapt to weather conditions, showing promise for real-world deployment to improve traffic safety and reduce weather-related crashes.

Abstract: Inclement weather conditions can significantly impact driver visibility and tire-road surface friction, requiring adjusted safe driving speeds to reduce crash risk. This study proposes a hybrid predictive framework that recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeway travel under diverse weather conditions. Leveraging high-resolution Connected Vehicle (CV) data and Road Weather Information System (RWIS) data collected in Buffalo, NY, from 2022 to 2023, we construct a spatiotemporally aligned dataset containing over 6.6 million records across 73 days. The core model employs Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to estimate vehicle speed distributions in 10-minute windows, using 26 input features that capture meteorological, pavement, and temporal conditions. To enforce safety constraints, a physics-based upper speed limit is computed for each interval based on real-time road grip and visibility, ensuring that vehicles can safely stop within their sight distance. The final recommended interval fuses QRF-predicted quantiles with both posted speed limits and the physics-derived upper bound. Experimental results demonstrate strong predictive performance: the QRF model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph, with 96.43% of median speed predictions within 5 mph, a PICP (50%) of 48.55%, and robust generalization across weather types. The model's ability to respond to changing weather conditions and generalize across road segments shows promise for real-world deployment, thereby improving traffic safety and reducing weather-related crashes.

### [213] [Does SGD Seek Flatness or Sharpness? An Exactly Solvable Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05065)
*Yizhou Xu,Pierfrancesco Beneventano,Isaac Chuang,Liu Ziyin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGD doesn't inherently prefer flatness but seeks minimal gradient fluctuations; flat minima emerge only with isotropic label noise, while anisotropic noise leads to sharp solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve contradictory evidence about whether SGD prefers flat or sharp minima, and to causally understand SGD's flatness-seeking behavior through an analytically solvable model.

Method: Developed an analytically solvable model that exhibits both flattening and sharpening behavior during training, then validated insights with MLP, RNN, and transformer architectures in controlled settings.

Result: SGD has no inherent preference for flatness but seeks minimal gradient fluctuations; flat minima occur only with isotropic label noise across all output dimensions, while anisotropic noise leads to arbitrarily sharp solutions depending on noise imbalance.

Conclusion: Data distribution uniquely determines sharpness at convergence, not SGD's inherent preferences; flat minima emerge specifically from isotropic label noise, resolving previous contradictory evidence about SGD's flatness-seeking behavior.

Abstract: A large body of theory and empirical work hypothesizes a connection between the flatness of a neural network's loss landscape during training and its performance. However, there have been conceptually opposite pieces of evidence regarding when SGD prefers flatter or sharper solutions during training. In this work, we partially but causally clarify the flatness-seeking behavior of SGD by identifying and exactly solving an analytically solvable model that exhibits both flattening and sharpening behavior during training. In this model, the SGD training has no \textit{a priori} preference for flatness, but only a preference for minimal gradient fluctuations. This leads to the insight that, at least within this model, it is data distribution that uniquely determines the sharpness at convergence, and that a flat minimum is preferred if and only if the noise in the labels is isotropic across all output dimensions. When the noise in the labels is anisotropic, the model instead prefers sharpness and can converge to an arbitrarily sharp solution, depending on the imbalance in the noise in the labels spectrum. We reproduce this key insight in controlled settings with different model architectures such as MLP, RNN, and transformers.

TL;DR: Hybrid verifier in branch-and-bound framework for neural network robustness verification, using exact nonlinear program with complementarity constraints for tight upper bounds and efficient pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks have strong empirical performance but lack robustness guarantees for safety-critical applications. Current formal verification methods face a scalability-completeness trade-off, needing better approaches.

Method: Proposes a hybrid verifier in branch-and-bound framework with: 1) exact NLP with complementarity constraints (NLP-CC) for upper bounds that preserves ReLU input-output graph, 2) warm-started NLP solves with minimal constraint updates, 3) pattern-aligned strong branching prioritizing effective splits.

Result: Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show: markedly tighter upper bounds than PGD across perturbation radii (up to 3 orders of magnitude), fast per-node solves, substantial end-to-end speedups over MIP-based verification, amplified by warm-starting, GPU batching, and pattern-aligned branching.

Conclusion: The hybrid verifier efficiently tightens both upper and lower bounds to reach ε-global optimum, provides conditions for tight NLP-CC upper bounds, and enables rapid pruning of unsafe subproblems through valid counterexamples from feasible NLP-CC solutions.

Abstract: Neural networks achieve strong empirical performance, but robustness concerns still hinder deployment in safety-critical applications. Formal verification provides robustness guarantees, but current methods face a scalability-completeness trade-off. We propose a hybrid verifier in a branch-and-bound (BaB) framework that efficiently tightens both upper and lower bounds until an $ε-$global optimum is reached or early stop is triggered. The key is an exact nonlinear program with complementarity constraints (NLP-CC) for upper bounding that preserves the ReLU input-output graph, so any feasible solution yields a valid counterexample and enables rapid pruning of unsafe subproblems. We further accelerate verification with (i) warm-started NLP solves requiring minimal constraint-matrix updates and (ii) pattern-aligned strong branching that prioritizes splits most effective at tightening relaxations. We also provide conditions under which NLP-CC upper bounds are tight. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show markedly tighter upper bounds than PGD across perturbation radii spanning up to three orders of magnitude, fast per-node solves in practice, and substantial end-to-end speedups over MIP-based verification, amplified by warm-starting, GPU batching, and pattern-aligned branching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explanation reliability remains largely unmeasured despite being essential in high-stakes domains. Popular explanation methods can vary substantially under realistic conditions, undermining trust in XAI systems.

Method: Introduces Explanation Reliability Index (ERI) metrics based on four reliability axioms: robustness to input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to distributional shifts. Also proposes ERI-T for sequential models and ERI-Bench benchmark.

Result: Experimental results reveal widespread reliability failures in popular explanation methods, showing explanations can be unstable under realistic deployment conditions.

Conclusion: ERI enables principled assessment of explanation reliability and supports more trustworthy XAI systems by exposing and quantifying explanation instabilities.

Abstract: In recent years, explaining decisions made by complex machine learning models has become essential in high-stakes domains such as energy systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, the reliability of these explanations, namely, whether they remain stable and consistent under realistic, non-adversarial changes, remains largely unmeasured. Widely used methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG) are well-motivated by axiomatic notions of attribution, yet their explanations can vary substantially even under system-level conditions, including small input perturbations, correlated representations, and minor model updates. Such variability undermines explanation reliability, as reliable explanations should remain consistent across equivalent input representations and small, performance-preserving model changes. We introduce the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI), a family of metrics that quantifies explanation stability under four reliability axioms: robustness to small input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to mild distributional shifts. For each axiom, we derive formal guarantees, including Lipschitz-type bounds and temporal stability results. We further propose ERI-T, a dedicated measure of temporal reliability for sequential models, and introduce ERI-Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test explanation reliability across synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal widespread reliability failures in popular explanation methods, showing that explanations can be unstable under realistic deployment conditions. By exposing and quantifying these instabilities, ERI enables principled assessment of explanation reliability and supports more trustworthy explainable AI (XAI) systems.

*Zhiqun Zuo,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses individual fairness in strategic classification, showing deterministic thresholds violate fairness, proposing randomized classifiers with linear programming optimization, and demonstrating effectiveness on real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strategic classification creates fairness challenges when individuals modify features to influence ML decisions. While group fairness has been studied, individual fairness remains underexplored in this setting.

Method: Analyze threshold-based classifiers, prove deterministic thresholds violate individual fairness, introduce conditions for randomized classifiers to achieve fairness, formulate as linear programming problem to find optimal fair classifier, and extend to group fairness.

Result: Proved deterministic thresholds violate individual fairness, developed conditions for fair randomized classifiers, created linear programming solution for optimal fair classifier, and demonstrated effectiveness on real-world datasets with improved fairness-accuracy trade-off.

Conclusion: Randomized classifiers can achieve individual fairness in strategic classification where deterministic thresholds fail, with linear programming providing optimal solutions that work for both individual and group fairness notions, validated by real-world experiments.

Abstract: Strategic classification, where individuals modify their features to influence machine learning (ML) decisions, presents critical fairness challenges. While group fairness in this setting has been widely studied, individual fairness remains underexplored. We analyze threshold-based classifiers and prove that deterministic thresholds violate individual fairness. Then, we investigate the possibility of using a randomized classifier to achieve individual fairness. We introduce conditions under which a randomized classifier ensures individual fairness and leverage these conditions to find an optimal and individually fair randomized classifier through a linear programming problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be extended to group fairness notions. Experiments on real-world datasets confirm that our method effectively mitigates unfairness and improves the fairness-accuracy trade-off.

*Parsa Vares*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoDiscover is an adaptive active learning framework that treats systematic literature review screening as an online decision-making problem, using a heterogeneous graph attention network and discounted Thompson sampling to dynamically manage query strategies, outperforming static approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual screening for systematic literature reviews is a bottleneck due to growing scientific output, low prevalence of relevant studies, and scarce expert decisions. Traditional active learning systems use fixed query strategies that don't adapt over time and ignore relational structure in scientific literature.

Method: AutoDiscover models literature as a heterogeneous graph capturing relationships among documents, authors, and metadata. A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) learns node representations, and a Discounted Thompson Sampling (DTS) agent dynamically manages a portfolio of query strategies, balancing exploration and exploitation with real-time human-in-the-loop labels.

Result: On the 26-dataset SYNERGY benchmark, AutoDiscover achieves higher screening efficiency than static AL baselines. The agent mitigates cold start by bootstrapping discovery from minimal initial labels where static approaches fail. TS-Insight visual analytics dashboard helps interpret agent decisions.

Conclusion: AutoDiscover accelerates systematic literature review screening under scarce expert labels and low prevalence of relevant studies by reframing active learning as an adaptive online decision-making problem, with the framework outperforming traditional static approaches.

Abstract: Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are fundamental to evidence-based research, but manual screening is an increasing bottleneck as scientific output grows. Screening features low prevalence of relevant studies and scarce, costly expert decisions. Traditional active learning (AL) systems help, yet typically rely on fixed query strategies for selecting the next unlabeled documents. These static strategies do not adapt over time and ignore the relational structure of scientific literature networks. This thesis introduces AutoDiscover, a framework that reframes AL as an online decision-making problem driven by an adaptive agent. Literature is modeled as a heterogeneous graph capturing relationships among documents, authors, and metadata. A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) learns node representations, which a Discounted Thompson Sampling (DTS) agent uses to dynamically manage a portfolio of query strategies. With real-time human-in-the-loop labels, the agent balances exploration and exploitation under non-stationary review dynamics, where strategy utility changes over time. On the 26-dataset SYNERGY benchmark, AutoDiscover achieves higher screening efficiency than static AL baselines. Crucially, the agent mitigates cold start by bootstrapping discovery from minimal initial labels where static approaches fail. We also introduce TS-Insight, an open-source visual analytics dashboard to interpret, verify, and diagnose the agent's decisions. Together, these contributions accelerate SLR screening under scarce expert labels and low prevalence of relevant studies.

*Thanawat Sornwanee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a new stochastic gradient method for combinatorial optimization problems that requires only a single function query, generalizing REINFORCE and introducing new gradient estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combinatorial optimization problems reformulated as probabilistic problems require optimization over hypercubes (Bernoulli parameters), but exact gradient computation typically needs multiple function queries, which is computationally expensive.

Method: Develops a stochastic gradient estimator that is unbiased and requires only a single query of the combinatorial function. The method generalizes REINFORCE (via importance sampling) and introduces a new class of stochastic gradients.

Result: Proposes a novel gradient estimation framework that reduces computational cost from multiple queries to just one query per gradient step while maintaining unbiasedness.

Conclusion: The single-query stochastic gradient method provides an efficient alternative for combinatorial optimization, generalizing existing approaches and offering new gradient estimators with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: In a probabilistic reformulation of a combinatorial problem, we often face an optimization over a hypercube, which corresponds to the Bernoulli probability parameter for each binary variable in the primal problem. The combinatorial nature suggests that an exact gradient computation requires multiple queries. We propose a stochastic gradient that is unbiased and requires only a single query of the combinatorial function. This method encompasses a well-established REINFORCE (through an importance sampling), as well as including a class of new stochastic gradients.

TL;DR: RRD is a recursive rubric refinement framework that improves LLM judging and reward modeling by decomposing coarse rubrics into fine-grained criteria and filtering out misaligned/redundant ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rubric generation for LLM judges suffers from poor coverage, conflation of dimensions, misaligned preference direction, and redundant/correlated criteria, which degrades judge accuracy and produces suboptimal rewards during reinforcement fine-tuning.

Method: RRD uses a recursive decompose-filter cycle: decomposes coarse rubrics into fine-grained discriminative criteria, filters out misaligned and redundant rubrics, and applies correlation-aware weighting to prevent over-representing correlated criteria.

Result: RRD improves preference-judgment accuracy on JudgeBench and PPE benchmarks (+17.7 points on JudgeBench), boosts reward signals for RFT by up to 160% (Qwen3-4B) and 60% (Llama3.1-8B), with gains transferring to HealthBench-Hard and BiGGen Bench.

Conclusion: RRD establishes recursive rubric refinement as a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM judging and reward modeling in open-ended domains, delivering consistent gains across both evaluation and training.

Abstract: Recently, rubrics have been used to guide LLM judges in capturing subjective, nuanced, multi-dimensional human preferences, and have been extended from evaluation to reward signals for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, rubric generation remains hard to control: rubrics often lack coverage, conflate dimensions, misalign preference direction, and contain redundant or highly correlated criteria, degrading judge accuracy and producing suboptimal rewards during RFT. We propose RRD, a principled framework for rubric refinement built on a recursive decompose-filter cycle. RRD decomposes coarse rubrics into fine-grained, discriminative criteria, expanding coverage while sharpening separation between responses. A complementary filtering mechanism removes misaligned and redundant rubrics, and a correlation-aware weighting scheme prevents over-representing highly correlated criteria, yielding rubric sets that are informative, comprehensive, and non-redundant. Empirically, RRD delivers large, consistent gains across both evaluation and training: it improves preference-judgment accuracy on JudgeBench and PPE for both GPT-4o and Llama3.1-405B judges, achieving top performance in all settings with up to +17.7 points on JudgeBench. When used as the reward source for RFT on WildChat, it yields substantially stronger and more stable learning signals, boosting reward by up to 160% (Qwen3-4B) and 60% (Llama3.1-8B) versus 10-20% for prior rubric baselines, with gains that transfer to HealthBench-Hard and BiGGen Bench. Overall, RRD establishes recursive rubric refinement as a scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM judging and reward modeling in open-ended domains.

*Olga Ovcharenko,Matthias Boehm,Sebastian Schelter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SemPipes is a declarative programming model that uses LLMs to synthesize code for tabular ML pipelines, enabling natural language specification of data transformations with automatic optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular ML requires complex data preparation pipelines that demand substantial domain expertise and engineering effort. The authors aim to leverage LLMs to support tabular ML through automated code synthesis, reducing the burden on human experts.

Method: SemPipes introduces semantic operators that specify data transformations in natural language while delegating execution to a runtime system. During training, it synthesizes custom operator implementations based on data characteristics, operator instructions, and pipeline context. The system uses LLM-based code synthesis guided by evolutionary search to automatically optimize data operations.

Conclusion: SemPipes demonstrates that LLM-powered semantic operators can effectively support tabular ML through code synthesis, improving performance while simplifying pipeline design and implementation.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning on tabular data relies on complex data preparation pipelines for prediction, data integration, augmentation, and debugging. Designing these pipelines requires substantial domain expertise and engineering effort, motivating the question of how large language models (LLMs) can support tabular ML through code synthesis. We introduce SemPipes, a novel declarative programming model that integrates LLM-powered semantic data operators into tabular ML pipelines. Semantic operators specify data transformations in natural language while delegating execution to a runtime system. During training, SemPipes synthesizes custom operator implementations based on data characteristics, operator instructions, and pipeline context. This design enables the automatic optimization of data operations in a pipeline via LLM-based code synthesis guided by evolutionary search. We evaluate SemPipes across diverse tabular ML tasks and show that semantic operators substantially improve end-to-end predictive performance for both expert-designed and agent-generated pipelines, while reducing pipeline complexity. We implement SemPipes in Python and release it at https://github.com/deem-data/sempipes/tree/v1.

### [221] [Decoupled Orthogonal Dynamics: Regularization for Deep Network Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05136)
*Hao Chen,Jinghui Yuan,Hanmin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdamW's weight decay causes radial oscillations that degrade learning; AdamO decouples norm control from directional updates for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies a fundamental conflict in AdamW called the "Radial Tug-of-War" - gradients tend to increase parameter norms for capacity expansion while weight decay suppresses norm growth, causing radial oscillations that inject noise into Adam's second-moment estimates and degrade feature learning.

Method: Proposes Orthogonal Dynamics Decoupling (AdamO) which separates norm control from directional updates: uses SGD-style update for one-dimensional norm control while confining Adam's adaptive preconditioning to the tangential subspace. Also incorporates curvature-adaptive radial step sizing and architecture-aware rules/projections for scale-invariant layers and low-dimensional parameters.

Result: Experiments on vision and language tasks show that AdamO improves generalization and stability over AdamW without introducing additional complex constraints.

Conclusion: AdamO successfully decouples magnitude and direction in optimizer dynamics, addressing the Radial Tug-of-War problem in AdamW and leading to better optimization performance across diverse deep learning tasks.

Abstract: Is the standard weight decay in AdamW truly optimal? Although AdamW decouples weight decay from adaptive gradient scaling, a fundamental conflict remains: the Radial Tug-of-War. In deep learning, gradients tend to increase parameter norms to expand effective capacity while steering directions to learn features, whereas weight decay indiscriminately suppresses norm growth. This push--pull interaction induces radial oscillations, injecting noise into Adam's second-moment estimates and potentially degrading delicate tangential feature learning. We argue that magnitude and direction play distinct roles and should be decoupled in optimizer dynamics. We propose Orthogonal Dynamics Decoupling and instantiate it as AdamO: an SGD-style update handles the one-dimensional norm control, while Adam's adaptive preconditioning is confined to the tangential subspace. AdamO further incorporates curvature-adaptive radial step sizing and architecture-aware rules and projections for scale-invariant layers and low-dimensional parameters. Experiments on vision and language tasks show that AdamO improves generalization and stability over AdamW without introducing additional complex constraints.

*Jikai Jin,Kenneth Hung,Sanath Kumar Krishnamurthy,Baoyi Shi,Congshan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: State-model-free bandit algorithms that use lagged contexts and probing strategies to handle hidden time-varying states without explicit state modeling, outperforming classical approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical multi-armed bandit algorithms fail in environments with hidden, time-varying states that confound reward estimation and optimal action selection due to unobserved confounders causing biased reward estimates and limited state information.

Method: Introduce state-model-free bandit algorithms leveraging lagged contextual features and coordinated probing strategies to implicitly track latent states and disambiguate state-dependent reward patterns without explicit state modeling.

Result: Empirical results across diverse settings demonstrate superior performance over classical approaches, with adaptive variants combining computational efficiency with robust adaptation to non-stationary rewards.

Conclusion: The proposed state-model-free methods effectively handle hidden confounders in sequential decision-making, and practical recommendations are provided for algorithm selection in real-world applications.

Abstract: The multi-armed bandit problem is a core framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical algorithms often fail in environments with hidden, time-varying states that confound reward estimation and optimal action selection. We address key challenges arising from unobserved confounders, such as biased reward estimates and limited state information, by introducing a family of state-model-free bandit algorithms that leverage lagged contextual features and coordinated probing strategies. These implicitly track latent states and disambiguate state-dependent reward patterns. Our methods and their adaptive variants can learn optimal policies without explicit state modeling, combining computational efficiency with robust adaptation to non-stationary rewards. Empirical results across diverse settings demonstrate superior performance over classical approaches, and we provide practical recommendations for algorithm selection in real-world applications.

### [223] [Fairness Under Group-Conditional Prior Probability Shift: Invariance, Drift, and Target-Aware Post-Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05144)
*Amir Asiaee,Kaveh Aryan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies fairness under group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS), where label prevalence changes across groups but feature distributions remain stable. It shows error-rate fairness criteria are invariant while acceptance-rate criteria can drift, provides identifiability results for target metrics without labels, and proposes a label-free post-processing algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning systems are often trained on historical data but deployed in shifting environments where positive outcome prevalence changes differently across demographic groups (e.g., disease rates rising faster in one population). This creates fairness challenges when conditions change between training and deployment.

Method: Theoretical analysis of GPPS, proving structural properties of fairness criteria under shift. Development of identifiability results showing target-domain metrics can be estimated from source labels and unlabeled target data. Proposal of TAP-GPPS algorithm: a label-free post-processing method that estimates prevalences from unlabeled data, corrects posteriors, and selects thresholds to satisfy demographic parity in target domain.

Result: 1) Fundamental dichotomy: error-rate fairness criteria (equalized odds) are invariant under GPPS, while acceptance-rate criteria (demographic parity) can drift unavoidably. 2) Target-domain risk and fairness metrics are identifiable without target labels using ROC invariance. 3) TAP-GPPS algorithm achieves target fairness with minimal utility loss in experiments.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical foundations for fairness under distribution shift, showing which fairness criteria are robust to prevalence changes and enabling practical solutions for maintaining fairness in shifting environments without requiring labeled target data.

Abstract: Machine learning systems are often trained and evaluated for fairness on historical data, yet deployed in environments where conditions have shifted. A particularly common form of shift occurs when the prevalence of positive outcomes changes differently across demographic groups--for example, when disease rates rise faster in one population than another, or when economic conditions affect loan default rates unequally. We study group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS), where the label prevalence $P(Y=1\mid A=a)$ may change between training and deployment while the feature-generation process $P(X\mid Y,A)$ remains stable. Our analysis yields three main contributions. First, we prove a fundamental dichotomy: fairness criteria based on error rates (equalized odds) are structurally invariant under GPPS, while acceptance-rate criteria (demographic parity) can drift--and we prove this drift is unavoidable for non-trivial classifiers (shift-robust impossibility). Second, we show that target-domain risk and fairness metrics are identifiable without target labels: the invariance of ROC quantities under GPPS enables consistent estimation from source labels and unlabeled target data alone, with finite-sample guarantees. Third, we propose TAP-GPPS, a label-free post-processing algorithm that estimates prevalences from unlabeled data, corrects posteriors, and selects thresholds to satisfy demographic parity in the target domain. Experiments validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that TAP-GPPS achieves target fairness with minimal utility loss.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TIDE is a serving-engine-native framework that integrates online draft adaptation into LLM inference systems, achieving up to 1.15x throughput improvement over static speculative decoding with 1.67x reduction in draft training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative decoding can accelerate LLM inference, but practical implementation is challenging due to evolving workloads and system-level constraints. Existing approaches struggle with adapting to changing conditions and incur overhead from recomputing training signals.

Method: TIDE integrates online draft adaptation directly into LLM inference systems by: 1) reusing target model hidden states as training signals for zero-overhead adaptation, 2) employing adaptive runtime control to activate speculation/training only when beneficial, and 3) exploiting heterogeneous clusters by mapping decoupled inference and training to appropriate GPU classes.

Result: Across diverse real-world workloads, TIDE achieves up to 1.15x throughput improvement over static speculative decoding while reducing draft training time by 1.67x compared to approaches that recompute training signals.

Conclusion: TIDE demonstrates that serving-engine-native integration of online draft adaptation with zero-overhead training signal reuse and adaptive control can effectively realize the benefits of speculative decoding in practical LLM serving scenarios.

Abstract: Speculative decoding can substantially accelerate LLM inference, but realizing its benefits in practice is challenging due to evolving workloads and system-level constraints. We present TIDE (Temporal Incremental Draft Engine), a serving-engine-native framework that integrates online draft adaptation directly into high-performance LLM inference systems. TIDE reuses target model hidden states generated during inference as training signals, enabling zero-overhead draft adaptation without reloading the target model, and employs adaptive runtime control to activate speculation and training only when beneficial. TIDE exploits heterogeneous clusters by mapping decoupled inference and training to appropriate GPU classes. Across diverse real-world workloads, TIDE achieves up to 1.15x throughput improvement over static speculative decoding while reducing draft training time by 1.67x compared to approaches that recompute training signals.

### [225] [Cross-talk based multi-task learning for fault classification of physically coupled machine system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05146)
*Wonjun Yi,Rismaya Kumar Mishra,Yong-Hwa Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-task learning with cross-talk architecture improves fault classification by leveraging physical coupling between fault conditions and related physical variables in machine systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine signals naturally embed coupled information about fault conditions and physical variables, but existing fault classification studies rely only on direct fault labels, missing valuable physical coupling information.

Method: Proposed a multi-task learning framework using cross-talk architecture that allows controlled information exchange between tasks while preventing negative transfer. Extended residual neural dimension reductor model to two benchmarks: drone fault dataset (machine type and maneuvering direction) and motor compound fault dataset (coupled fault components).

Result: The cross-talk architecture consistently outperformed single-task models, multi-class models merging all label combinations, and shared trunk multi-task models across both benchmarks. Also tested classification performance with single-channel vs multi-channel data for motor compound faults.

Conclusion: Leveraging physical coupling through multi-task learning with cross-talk architecture significantly improves fault classification performance compared to traditional approaches, demonstrating the value of incorporating related physical variables in fault diagnosis systems.

Abstract: Machine systems inherently generate signals in which fault conditions and various physical variables are physically coupled. Although many existing fault classification studies rely solely on direct fault labels, the aforementioned signals naturally embed additional information shaped by other physically coupled information. Herein, we leverage this coupling through a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that jointly learns fault conditions and the related physical variables. Among MTL architectures, crosstalk structures have distinct advantages because they allow for controlled information exchange between tasks through the cross-talk layer while preventing negative transfer, in contrast to shared trunk architectures that often mix incompatible features. We build on our previously introduced residual neural dimension reductor model, and extend its application to two benchmarks where physical coupling is prominent. The first benchmark is a drone fault dataset, in which machine type and maneuvering direction significantly alter the frequency components of measured signals even under the same nominal condition. By learning fault classification together with these physical attributes, the cross-talk architecture can better classify faults. The second benchmark dataset is the motor compound fault dataset. In this system, each fault component, inner race fault, outer race fault, misalignment, and unbalance is coupled to the other. For motor compound fault, we also test classification performance when we use single-channel data or multi-channel data as input to the classifier. Across both benchmarks, our residual neural dimension reductor, consistently outperformed single-task models, multi-class models that merge all label combinations, and shared trunk multi-task models.

*Songtao Wei,Yi Li,Bohan Zhang,Zhichun Guo,Ying Huang,Yuede Ji,Miao Yin,Guanpeng Li,Bingzhe Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoSA is a new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning method that uses compressed sensing theory instead of low-rank decomposition, enabling more expressive model adaptation through random projections and a compact learnable core.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods like LoRA and PiSSA rely on low-rank decompositions, which may restrict expressivity when task-specific adaptations require more uniform singular value distributions. The authors aim to overcome this limitation.

Method: CoSA expresses weight updates through fixed random projection matrices and a compact learnable core, using compressed sensing theory. It encodes weight updates into a low-dimensional space and maps them back through random projections, providing a synthesis process for multi-scale adaptation.

Result: CoSA consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods across 10 diverse tasks (natural language understanding and generation) using 5 different models from RoBERTa, Llama, and Qwen families.

Conclusion: CoSA provides a principled perspective for efficient and expressive multi-scale model adaptation, offering a theoretical foundation from compressed sensing that overcomes limitations of low-rank assumptions in existing PEFT methods.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a practical paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) without updating all parameters. Most existing approaches, such as LoRA and PiSSA, rely on low-rank decompositions of weight updates. However, the low-rank assumption may restrict expressivity, particularly in task-specific adaptation scenarios where singular values are distributed relatively uniformly. To address this limitation, we propose CoSA (Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation), a new PEFT method extended from compressed sensing theory. Instead of constraining weight updates to a low-rank subspace, CoSA expresses them through fixed random projection matrices and a compact learnable core. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of CoSA as a synthesis process, proving that weight updates can be compactly encoded into a low-dimensional space and mapped back through random projections. Extensive experimental results show that CoSA provides a principled perspective for efficient and expressive multi-scale model adaptation. Specifically, we evaluate CoSA on 10 diverse tasks, including natural language understanding and generation, employing 5 models of different scales from RoBERTa, Llama, and Qwen families. Across these settings, CoSA consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods.

*Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui,Eleni Triantafillou,David Krueger,Adrian Weller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that capability control (imposing hard limits on model behavior) should be treated separately from alignment, and proposes a defense-in-depth approach using three layers of control mechanisms across the model lifecycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have broad capabilities that enable many applications but also expand potential misuse and failures. Current approaches often conflate alignment (context/preference-driven) with capability control (hard operational limits), which are distinct goals requiring different approaches.

Method: Proposes a three-layer framework for capability control: (1) data-based control of training distribution, (2) learning-based control via weight- or representation-level interventions, and (3) system-based control via post-deployment guardrails over inputs, outputs, and actions. Advocates for defense-in-depth composition across all layers.

Result: A conceptual framework that distinguishes capability control from alignment and organizes control mechanisms across the model lifecycle. Identifies that each control layer has characteristic failure modes when used in isolation, necessitating a comprehensive, layered approach.

Conclusion: Capability control should be treated as distinct from alignment, requiring a defense-in-depth approach that combines complementary controls across data, learning, and system layers. Key challenges include the dual-use nature of knowledge and compositional generalization.

Abstract: Foundation models are trained on broad data distributions, yielding generalist capabilities that enable many downstream applications but also expand the space of potential misuse and failures. This position paper argues that capability control -- imposing restrictions on permissible model behavior -- should be treated as a distinct goal from alignment. While alignment is often context and preference-driven, capability control aims to impose hard operational limits on permissible behaviors, including under adversarial elicitation. We organize capability control mechanisms across the model lifecycle into three layers: (i) data-based control of the training distribution, (ii) learning-based control via weight- or representation-level interventions, and (iii) system-based control via post-deployment guardrails over inputs, outputs, and actions. Because each layer has characteristic failure modes when used in isolation, we advocate for a defense-in-depth approach that composes complementary controls across the full stack. We further outline key open challenges in achieving such control, including the dual-use nature of knowledge and compositional generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EBPO is a new RLVR method that improves stability over GRPO by using empirical Bayes shrinkage to combine local group statistics with global priors, reducing variance and preventing vanishing gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods like GRPO have stability issues: high variance with small group sizes and vanishing gradients when all responses get zero rewards (saturated failure regimes).

Method: EBPO uses empirical Bayes shrinkage estimator that dynamically balances local group statistics with a global prior updated via Welford's online algorithm, regularizing local baselines with global statistics.

Result: EBPO outperforms GRPO and other baselines on benchmarks like AIME and OlympiadBench, shows superior training stability with small groups, and benefits from curriculum learning.

Conclusion: EBPO provides a more stable and effective RLVR framework that addresses critical limitations of existing approaches through empirical Bayes regularization.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, dominant approaches like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical stability challenges: they suffer from high estimator variance under computational constraints (small group sizes) and vanishing gradient signals in saturated failure regimes where all responses yield identical zero rewards. To address this, we propose Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO), a novel framework that regularizes local group-based baselines by borrowing strength from the policy's accumulated global statistics. Instead of estimating baselines in isolation, EBPO employs a shrinkage estimator that dynamically balances local group statistics with a global prior updated via Welford's online algorithm. Theoretically, we demonstrate that EBPO guarantees strictly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), bounded entropy decay, and non-vanishing penalty signals in failure scenarios compared to GRPO. Empirically, EBPO consistently outperforms GRPO and other established baselines across diverse benchmarks, including AIME and OlympiadBench. Notably, EBPO exhibits superior training stability, achieving high-performance gains even with small group sizes, and benefits significantly from difficulty-stratified curriculum learning.

TL;DR: Deep learning models (BiLSTM, Medformer, ST-Transformer, TCN) for daily hypoxia classification in Gulf of Mexico achieve high accuracy, with ST-Transformer performing best (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current seasonal hypoxia forecasts are too coarse for daily ecosystem management needs. There's a need for fine-scale, real-time prediction tools to support responsive environmental management in coastal regions like the Gulf of Mexico.

Method: Four deep learning architectures (BiLSTM, Medformer, ST-Transformer, TCN) were trained on 12 years of daily hindcast data (2009-2020) from a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Models incorporated water column stratification, sediment oxygen consumption, and temperature-dependent decomposition rates. Evaluation used consistent preprocessing, input/output formulation, and validation protocols, with McNemar's test for statistical significance.

Result: All models achieved high classification accuracy and strong discriminative ability. ST-Transformer performed best across all metrics and test periods (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992). Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences in model predictions.

Conclusion: The study provides a reproducible framework for operational real-time hypoxia prediction that can support environmental and ocean modeling communities, enhancing ecosystem resilience management in coastal regions.

Abstract: Coastal hypoxia, especially in the northern part of Gulf of Mexico, presents a persistent ecological and economic concern. Seasonal models offer coarse forecasts that miss the fine-scale variability needed for daily, responsive ecosystem management. We present study that compares four deep learning architectures for daily hypoxia classification: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Medformer (Medical Transformer), Spatio-Temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). We trained our models with twelve years of daily hindcast data from 2009-2020 Our training data consists of 2009-2020 hindcast data from a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Similarly, we use hindcast data from 2020 through 2024 as a test data. We constructed classification models incorporating water column stratification, sediment oxygen consumption, and temperature-dependent decomposition rates. We evaluated each architectures using the same data preprocessing, input/output formulation, and validation protocols. Each model achieved high classification accuracy and strong discriminative ability with ST-Transformer achieving the highest performance across all metrics and tests periods (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992). We also employed McNemar's method to identify statistically significant differences in model predictions. Our contribution is a reproducible framework for operational real-time hypoxia prediction that can support broader efforts in the environmental and ocean modeling systems community and in ecosystem resilience.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Researchers analyze RL training in complex multi-agent environments using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and LLM-summarizers, introducing Meta-Autointerp to group SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are increasingly trained in complex RL multi-agent environments, making it difficult to understand how behavior changes over training. There's a need for better interpretability methods to analyze training dynamics in sophisticated environments like Full-Press Diplomacy.

Method: Apply pretrained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) alongside LLM-summarizer methods to analyze large-scale RL training runs. Introduce Meta-Autointerp, a method for grouping SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics. Use automated evaluation and user studies to validate findings.

Result: Discovered fine-grained behaviors including role-playing patterns, degenerate outputs, language switching, high-level strategic behaviors, and environment-specific bugs. Validated that 90% of discovered SAE Meta-Features are significant, and found surprising reward hacking behavior. User studies showed most SAE features and LLM-generated hypotheses are not useful to humans, but a subset of SAE-derived hypotheses are predictively useful for downstream tasks. Augmenting an untrained agent's system prompt improved score by +14.2%.

Conclusion: SAEs and LLM-summarizers provide complementary views into agent behavior. The framework forms a practical starting point for future data-centric interpretability work on ensuring trustworthy LLM behavior throughout training, though human evaluation remains challenging.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained in complex Reinforcement Learning, multi-agent environments, making it difficult to understand how behavior changes over training. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently shown to be useful for data-centric interpretability. In this work, we analyze large-scale reinforcement learning training runs from the sophisticated environment of Full-Press Diplomacy by applying pretrained SAEs, alongside LLM-summarizer methods. We introduce Meta-Autointerp, a method for grouping SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics. We discover fine-grained behaviors including role-playing patterns, degenerate outputs, language switching, alongside high-level strategic behaviors and environment-specific bugs. Through automated evaluation, we validate that 90% of discovered SAE Meta-Features are significant, and find a surprising reward hacking behavior. However, through two user studies, we find that even subjectively interesting and seemingly helpful SAE features may be worse than useless to humans, along with most LLM generated hypotheses. However, a subset of SAE-derived hypotheses are predictively useful for downstream tasks. We further provide validation by augmenting an untrained agent's system prompt, improving the score by +14.2%. Overall, we show that SAEs and LLM-summarizer provide complementary views into agent behavior, and together our framework forms a practical starting point for future data-centric interpretability work on ensuring trustworthy LLM behavior throughout training.

*Chun-Wun Cheng,Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb,Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpectraKAN is a novel neural operator that conditions spectral convolution on input data, enabling adaptive multi-scale PDE solving with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spectral neural operators like FNO use static Fourier kernels applied uniformly across inputs, which limits their ability to capture multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic dynamics that depend on the global system state.

Method: SpectraKAN extracts a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and uses single-query cross-attention to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk, turning static spectral convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator.

Result: SpectraKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse PDE benchmarks, reducing RMSE by up to 49% over strong baselines, with particularly large gains on challenging spatio-temporal prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed input-conditioned spectral operator enables adaptive behavior while retaining spectral mixing efficiency, with theoretical justification showing convergence to resolution-independent continuous operators under mesh refinement.

Abstract: Spectral neural operators, particularly Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), are a powerful framework for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their efficient global mixing in the frequency domain. However, existing spectral operators rely on static Fourier kernels applied uniformly across inputs, limiting their ability to capture multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic dynamics governed by the global state of the system. We introduce SpectraKAN, a neural operator that conditions the spectral operator on the input itself, turning static spectral convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator. This is achieved by extracting a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and using it to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk via single-query cross-attention, enabling the operator to adapt its behaviour while retaining the efficiency of spectral mixing. We provide theoretical justification showing that this modulation converges to a resolution-independent continuous operator under mesh refinement and KAN gives smooth, Lipschitz-controlled global modulation.

TL;DR: Double-P: Hierarchical sparse attention framework that optimizes top-p accuracy, selection overhead, and sparse attention cost for efficient long-context LLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As long-context inference becomes central to LLMs, attention over growing key-value caches becomes a dominant decoding bottleneck. Existing sparse attention methods fail to jointly optimize accuracy, selection overhead, and attention cost.

Method: Hierarchical two-stage approach: 1) Coarse-grained top-p estimation at cluster level using size-weighted centroids, 2) Adaptive refinement through second top-p stage allocating token-level attention only when needed.

Result: Achieves near-zero accuracy drop across long-context benchmarks, reduces attention computation overhead by up to 1.8x, and delivers up to 1.3x end-to-end decoding speedup over state-of-the-art fixed-budget sparse attention methods.

Conclusion: Double-P provides an efficient hierarchical sparse attention framework that optimizes all three critical aspects (accuracy, selection overhead, attention cost) for scalable long-context LLM inference.

Abstract: As long-context inference becomes central to large language models (LLMs), attention over growing key-value caches emerges as a dominant decoding bottleneck, motivating sparse attention for scalable inference. Fixed-budget top-k sparse attention cannot adapt to heterogeneous attention distributions across heads and layers, whereas top-p sparse attention directly preserves attention mass and provides stronger accuracy guarantees. Existing top-p methods, however, fail to jointly optimize top-p accuracy, selection overhead, and sparse attention cost, which limits their overall efficiency. We present Double-P, a hierarchical sparse attention framework that optimizes all three stages. Double-P first performs coarse-grained top-p estimation at the cluster level using size-weighted centroids, then adaptively refines computation through a second top-p stage that allocates token-level attention only when needed. Across long-context benchmarks, Double-P consistently achieves near-zero accuracy drop, reducing attention computation overhead by up to 1.8x and delivers up to 1.3x end-to-end decoding speedup over state-of-the-art fixed-budget sparse attention methods.

### [233] [Extreme Weather Nowcasting via Local Precipitation Pattern Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05204)
*Changhoon Song,Teng Yuan Chang,Youngjoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: exPreCast is an efficient deterministic framework for radar precipitation nowcasting that handles both normal and extreme rainfall events using a balanced dataset and novel architecture components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current precipitation nowcasting faces challenges: diffusion models are computationally expensive for real-time use, deterministic models are biased toward normal rainfall, and existing datasets are skewed (either normal or extreme events only), limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes exPreCast framework with three key components: 1) local spatiotemporal attention, 2) texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and 3) temporal extractor for flexible forecasting horizons. Also introduces a new balanced radar dataset from KMA containing both ordinary and extreme precipitation events.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on established benchmarks (SEVIR and MeteoNet) and the new balanced KMA dataset, delivering accurate and reliable nowcasts across both normal and extreme rainfall regimes.

Conclusion: exPreCast provides an efficient deterministic solution for high-quality precipitation nowcasting that works well for both ordinary and extreme rainfall events, addressing computational and dataset limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall or storms is critical for risk management and disaster mitigation. Although high-resolution radar observations have spurred extensive research on nowcasting models, precipitation nowcasting remains particularly challenging due to pronounced spatial locality, intricate fine-scale rainfall structures, and variability in forecasting horizons. While recent diffusion-based generative ensembles show promising results, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, deterministic models are computationally efficient but remain biased toward normal rainfall. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets commonly used in prior studies are themselves skewed--either dominated by ordinary rainfall events or restricted to extreme rainfall episodes--thereby hindering general applicability in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for generating finely detailed radar forecasts, and introduce a newly constructed balanced radar dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which encompasses both ordinary precipitation and extreme events. Our model integrates local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor to flexibly adjust forecasting horizons. Experiments on established benchmarks (SEVIR and MeteoNet) as well as on the balanced KMA dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering accurate and reliable nowcasts across both normal and extreme rainfall regimes.

*Jinjin Chi,Taoping Liu,Mengtao Yin,Ximing Li,Yongcheng Jing,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A flow matching framework for disentangled representation learning that uses factor-conditioned flows and orthogonality regularization to achieve better semantic alignment and reduce information leakage between factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based disentanglement methods often lack strong semantic alignment despite encouraging factor independence through inductive biases. There's a need for approaches that better align learned factors with underlying explanatory variables while reducing cross-factor interference.

Method: Proposes a flow matching-based framework that casts disentanglement as learning factor-conditioned flows in a compact latent space. Introduces a non-overlap (orthogonality) regularizer to suppress cross-factor interference and reduce information leakage between factors.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple datasets show consistent improvements over representative baselines, achieving higher disentanglement scores as well as improved controllability and sample fidelity.

Conclusion: The flow matching framework with orthogonality regularization effectively addresses semantic alignment issues in disentangled representation learning, outperforming existing methods in both disentanglement quality and practical utility.

Abstract: Disentangled representation learning aims to capture the underlying explanatory factors of observed data, enabling a principled understanding of the data-generating process. Recent advances in generative modeling have introduced new paradigms for learning such representations. However, existing diffusion-based methods encourage factor independence via inductive biases, yet frequently lack strong semantic alignment. In this work, we propose a flow matching-based framework for disentangled representation learning, which casts disentanglement as learning factor-conditioned flows in a compact latent space. To enforce explicit semantic alignment, we introduce a non-overlap (orthogonality) regularizer that suppresses cross-factor interference and reduces information leakage between factors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over representative baselines, yielding higher disentanglement scores as well as improved controllability and sample fidelity.

### [235] [Private Prediction via Shrinkage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05219)
*Chao Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves differentially private prediction by reducing the sample complexity from √T to polylog(T) for streaming query answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard differentially private prediction requires √T dependence on number of queries T, which is inefficient for large T. The paper aims to achieve polylogarithmic dependence for streaming settings.

Method: Develops private predictors for streaming settings: 1) For oblivious online adversaries and any concept class C, uses ~O(VC(C)^{3.5}log^{3.5}T) labeled examples. 2) For adaptive online adversaries and halfspaces in ℝ^d, uses ~O(d^{5.5}log T) examples.

Result: Achieves polylogarithmic dependence on T instead of √T, significantly improving sample efficiency for differentially private prediction in streaming settings.

Conclusion: Differentially private prediction can be made much more efficient in streaming settings with polylogarithmic rather than square-root dependence on query count.

Abstract: We study differentially private prediction introduced by Dwork and Feldman (COLT 2018): an algorithm receives one labeled sample set $S$ and then answers a stream of unlabeled queries while the output transcript remains $(\varepsilon,δ)$-differentially private with respect to $S$. Standard composition yields a $\sqrt{T}$ dependence for $T$ queries.
  We show that this dependence can be reduced to polylogarithmic in $T$ in streaming settings. For an oblivious online adversary and any concept class $\mathcal{C}$, we give a private predictor that answers $T$ queries with $|S|= \tilde{O}(VC(\mathcal{C})^{3.5}\log^{3.5}T)$ labeled examples. For an adaptive online adversary and halfspaces over $\mathbb{R}^d$, we obtain $|S|=\tilde{O}\left(d^{5.5}\log T\right)$.

*Jiecheng Lu,Xu Han,Yan Sun,Viresh Pati,Yubin Kim,Siddhartha Somani,Shihao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZeroS is a linear attention method that overcomes limitations of existing approaches by enabling both positive/negative weights and contrastive operations while maintaining O(N) complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing linear attention methods offer O(N) complexity but underperform standard softmax attention due to two limitations: restriction to convex combinations (only additive blending) and uniform accumulated weight bias that dilutes attention in long contexts.

Method: Proposes Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS) which removes the constant zero-order term 1/t and reweights the remaining zero-sum softmax residuals. This creates mathematically stable weights that can be both positive and negative, enabling a single attention layer to perform contrastive operations while maintaining O(N) complexity.

Result: ZeroS theoretically expands the set of representable functions compared to convex combinations. Empirically, it matches or exceeds standard softmax attention across various sequence modeling benchmarks.

Conclusion: ZeroS addresses fundamental limitations of linear attention methods, enabling both efficient O(N) computation and competitive performance with standard softmax attention through its zero-sum formulation that supports contrastive operations.

Abstract: Linear attention methods offer Transformers $O(N)$ complexity but typically underperform standard softmax attention. We identify two fundamental limitations affecting these approaches: the restriction to convex combinations that only permits additive information blending, and uniform accumulated weight bias that dilutes attention in long contexts. We propose Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS), which addresses these limitations by removing the constant zero-order term $1/t$ and reweighting the remaining zero-sum softmax residuals. This modification creates mathematically stable weights, enabling both positive and negative values and allowing a single attention layer to perform contrastive operations. While maintaining $O(N)$ complexity, ZeroS theoretically expands the set of representable functions compared to convex combinations. Empirically, it matches or exceeds standard softmax attention across various sequence modeling benchmarks.

TL;DR: Proposes a data-centric framework for graph anomaly detection that combines dynamic graph modeling with balanced anomaly synthesis to address challenges of static transductive learning and extreme class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two major challenges in graph anomaly detection: (1) Most methods use transductive learning assuming static graphs, unsuitable for dynamic networks; (2) Extreme class imbalance leads to biased models that fail to generalize to unseen anomalies. These challenges are interdependent - static frameworks limit data augmentation while imbalance exacerbates model distortion.

Method: A data-centric framework with two key components: (1) Discrete ego-graph diffusion model that captures local topology of anomalies to generate ego-graphs aligned with anomalous structural distribution; (2) Curriculum anomaly augmentation mechanism that dynamically adjusts synthetic data generation during training, focusing on underrepresented anomaly patterns.

Result: Experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving anomaly detection and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed data-centric framework successfully addresses both model-level (static transductive learning) and data-level (class imbalance) challenges in graph anomaly detection through dynamic graph modeling and balanced anomaly synthesis.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is crucial in applications like fraud detection and cybersecurity. Despite recent advancements using graph neural networks (GNNs), two major challenges persist. At the model level, most methods adopt a transductive learning paradigm, which assumes static graph structures, making them unsuitable for dynamic, evolving networks. At the data level, the extreme class imbalance, where anomalous nodes are rare, leads to biased models that fail to generalize to unseen anomalies. These challenges are interdependent: static transductive frameworks limit effective data augmentation, while imbalance exacerbates model distortion in inductive learning settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel data-centric framework that integrates dynamic graph modeling with balanced anomaly synthesis. Our framework features: (1) a discrete ego-graph diffusion model, which captures the local topology of anomalies to generate ego-graphs aligned with anomalous structural distribution, and (2) a curriculum anomaly augmentation mechanism, which dynamically adjusts synthetic data generation during training, focusing on underrepresented anomaly patterns to improve detection and generalization. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the effectiveness of our framework.

### [238] [Faithful Bi-Directional Model Steering via Distribution Matching and Distributed Interchange Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05234)
*Yuntai Bao,Xuhong Zhang,Jintao Chen,Ge Su,Yuxiang Cai,Hao Peng,Bing Sun,Haiqin Weng,Liu Yan,Jianwei Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CDAS is a new model steering method that uses distributed interchange interventions with distribution matching instead of probability maximization, enabling more faithful and stable control while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current intervention-based steering methods often underperform and generate unnatural outputs because they adapt strong optimization objectives from fine-tuning, which can lead to overfitting. The authors hypothesize that effective steering requires faithful identification of internal model mechanisms rather than enforcement of external preferences.

Method: Concept DAS (CDAS) builds on distributed alignment search (DAS) principles, using distributed interchange interventions (DII) but introduces a novel distribution matching objective that aligns intervened output distributions with counterfactual distributions. It learns interventions via weak-supervised distribution matching rather than probability maximization.

Result: On AxBench, CDAS doesn't always outperform preference-optimization methods but benefits more from increased model scale. In safety case studies (overriding refusal behaviors and neutralizing chain-of-thought backdoors), CDAS achieves systematic steering while maintaining general model utility.

Conclusion: CDAS is complementary to preference-optimization approaches and conditionally constitutes a robust approach to intervention-based model steering, offering more faithful and stable control through distribution matching rather than probability maximization.

Abstract: Intervention-based model steering offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative to prompting and fine-tuning. However, by adapting strong optimization objectives from fine-tuning, current methods are susceptible to overfitting and often underperform, sometimes generating unnatural outputs. We hypothesize that this is because effective steering requires the faithful identification of internal model mechanisms, not the enforcement of external preferences. To this end, we build on the principles of distributed alignment search (DAS), the standard for causal variable localization, to propose a new steering method: Concept DAS (CDAS). While we adopt the core mechanism of DAS, distributed interchange intervention (DII), we introduce a novel distribution matching objective tailored for the steering task by aligning intervened output distributions with counterfactual distributions. CDAS differs from prior work in two main ways: first, it learns interventions via weak-supervised distribution matching rather than probability maximization; second, it uses DIIs that naturally enable bi-directional steering and allow steering factors to be derived from data, reducing the effort required for hyperparameter tuning and resulting in more faithful and stable control. On AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark, we show that CDAS does not always outperform preference-optimization methods but may benefit more from increased model scale. In two safety-related case studies, overriding refusal behaviors of safety-aligned models and neutralizing a chain-of-thought backdoor, CDAS achieves systematic steering while maintaining general model utility. These results indicate that CDAS is complementary to preference-optimization approaches and conditionally constitutes a robust approach to intervention-based model steering.

*Boxiang Zhang,Baijian Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CORP is a closed-form one-shot structured pruning framework for Vision Transformers that removes MLP dimensions and attention structures without retraining, using only a small unlabeled calibration set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers have high compute/memory costs, and existing pruning methods require retraining or multi-stage optimization, limiting post-training deployment. There's a need for efficient pruning that works under strict post-training constraints.

Method: CORP formulates pruning as representation recovery, models removed activations/attention logits as affine functions of retained components, and derives closed-form ridge regression solutions that fold compensation into model weights to minimize representation error.

Result: On DeiT-Huge with ImageNet, CORP retains 82.8% Top-1 accuracy after pruning 50% of both MLP and attention structures. It completes pruning in under 20 minutes on a single GPU and shows strong redundancy in MLP/attention representations.

Conclusion: CORP enables efficient post-training structured pruning of Vision Transformers without labels, gradients, or fine-tuning, delivering substantial real-world efficiency gains while preserving accuracy under aggressive sparsity.

Abstract: Vision Transformers achieve strong accuracy but incur high compute and memory cost. Structured pruning can reduce inference cost, but most methods rely on retraining or multi-stage optimization. These requirements limit post-training deployment. We propose \textbf{CORP}, a closed-form one-shot structured pruning framework for Vision Transformers. CORP removes entire MLP hidden dimensions and attention substructures without labels, gradients, or fine-tuning. It operates under strict post-training constraints using only a small unlabeled calibration set. CORP formulates structured pruning as a representation recovery problem. It models removed activations and attention logits as affine functions of retained components and derives closed-form ridge regression solutions that fold compensation into model weights. This minimizes expected representation error under the calibration distribution. Experiments on ImageNet with DeiT models show strong redundancy in MLP and attention representations. Without compensation, one-shot structured pruning causes severe accuracy degradation. With CORP, models preserve accuracy under aggressive sparsity. On DeiT-Huge, CORP retains 82.8\% Top-1 accuracy after pruning 50\% of both MLP and attention structures. CORP completes pruning in under 20 minutes on a single GPU and delivers substantial real-world efficiency gains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TADS is a task-aware data selection framework for multimodal pre-training that selects high-quality, relevant, and diverse data subsets, achieving better performance with only 36% of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web-crawled datasets for multimodal pre-training are noisy, misaligned, and redundant, leading to inefficient training. Existing data selection methods are either heuristic-based (biased) or task-agnostic (not optimized for multi-task scenarios).

Method: TADS integrates three learnable components: 1) Intrinsic Quality assessment with unimodal/cross-modal operators, 2) Task Relevance quantification via interpretable similarity vectors, and 3) Distributional Diversity optimization through cluster-based weighting. It uses feedback-driven meta-learning to adaptively refine selection based on proxy model performance across multiple downstream tasks.

Result: On CC12M dataset, TADS achieves superior zero-shot performance on ImageNet, CIFAR-100, MS-COCO, and Flickr30K benchmarks, using only 36% of data while outperforming baselines by an average of 1.0%.

Conclusion: TADS significantly enhances data efficiency by curating high-utility subsets that yield higher performance ceilings within the same computational constraints, demonstrating that intelligent data selection is crucial for effective multimodal pre-training.

Abstract: Large-scale multimodal pre-trained models like CLIP rely heavily on high-quality training data, yet raw web-crawled datasets are often noisy, misaligned, and redundant, leading to inefficient training and suboptimal generalization. Existing data selection methods are either heuristic-based, suffering from bias and limited diversity, or data-driven but task-agnostic, failing to optimize for multi-task scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce TADS (Task-Aware Data Selection), a novel framework for multi-task multimodal pre-training that integrates Intrinsic Quality, Task Relevance, and Distributional Diversity into a learnable value function. TADS employs a comprehensive quality assessment system with unimodal and cross-modal operators, quantifies task relevance via interpretable similarity vectors, and optimizes diversity through cluster-based weighting. A feedback-driven meta-learning mechanism adaptively refines the selection strategy based on proxy model performance across multiple downstream tasks. Experiments on CC12M demonstrate that TADS achieves superior zero-shot performance on benchmarks like ImageNet, CIFAR-100, MS-COCO, and Flickr30K, using only 36% of the data while outperforming baselines by an average of 1.0%. This highlights that TADS significantly enhances data efficiency by curating a high-utility subset that yields a much higher performance ceiling within the same computational constraints.

*David Alejandro Trejo Pizzo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HGF (Hybrid Gated Flow) is a dual-stream architecture that combines 1.58-bit ternary quantization with low-rank FP16 corrections to overcome memory bandwidth bottlenecks on edge devices, recovering 55% of quality loss with only 12-15% memory overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM deployment on edge devices faces "Memory Wall" bottlenecks where memory bandwidth limits performance. While 1.58-bit quantization reduces memory footprint, it causes 20-25% perplexity degradation compared to FP16 baselines.

Method: Hybrid Gated Flow (HGF) uses a dual-stream architecture: a 1.58-bit ternary backbone for efficiency plus a learnable low-rank FP16 correction path controlled by adaptive gates. This combines quantization efficiency with quality recovery.

Result: HGF achieves validation loss of 0.9306 vs BitNet's 1.0294, recovering ~55% of quality gap between ternary quantization and FP16 baseline (0.8490) with only ~12-15% memory overhead. Shows emergent "quantization as structural regularization" phenomenon.

Conclusion: HGF effectively addresses memory bandwidth constraints while maintaining model quality. The architecture scales to 1.2B and 3B parameter models, showing linear scaling of stability and quality recovery to production-grade language modeling.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the "Memory Wall" -- a hardware limitation where memory bandwidth, not compute, becomes the bottleneck. Recent 1.58-bit quantization techniques (e.g., BitNet b1.58) dramatically reduce memory footprint but typically incur a perplexity degradation of 20-25% compared to FP16 baselines. In this work, we introduce Hybrid Gated Flow (HGF), a dual-stream architecture that couples a 1.58-bit ternary backbone with a learnable, low-rank FP16 correction path controlled by adaptive gates.
  Through extensive experiments on the TinyStories dataset across two training regimes (2500 and 3500 steps), we demonstrate that HGF 5.4 achieves a validation loss of 0.9306 compared to BitNet's 1.0294, recovering approximately 55% of the quality gap between pure ternary quantization and the FP16 baseline (0.8490). This recovery is achieved with only ~12-15% memory overhead beyond the ternary backbone.
  Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence for an emergent phenomenon: quantization as structural regularization. While a full-precision differential attention baseline (Diff_Only) exhibited training instability with validation loss exceeding 1.68, the ternary-anchored HGF maintained robust convergence throughout training. Finally, we report preliminary results extending this architecture to 1.2B and 3B parameter models trained on SlimPajama and FineWeb-Edu. These larger-scale experiments confirm that the architectural stability and quality recovery observed in small-scale proxies scale linearly to production-grade language modeling regimes.

TL;DR: ProGRPO introduces Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) to address mode collapse in RLVR by rebalancing confidence across correct responses, improving diversity while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR methods like GRPO converge to low-entropy policies causing mode collapse and limited output diversity, disproportionately reinforcing highest-likelihood paths while suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains.

Method: Proposes Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) that incorporates Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into advantage estimation, dynamically reshaping reward signals to attenuate gradient updates of over-confident paths and redistribute probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions.

Result: Significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy. On Qwen2.5-7B, outperforms GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and 13.9% in Pass@32, showing superior capability in generating diverse correct reasoning paths.

Conclusion: ProGRPO effectively achieves superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks by mitigating entropy collapse through confidence equilibration across correct responses.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an indispensable paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard policy optimization methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often converge to low-entropy policies, leading to severe mode collapse and limited output diversity. We analyze this issue from the perspective of sampling probability dynamics, identifying that the standard objective disproportionately reinforces the highest-likelihood paths, thereby suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains. To address this, we propose a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) designed to equilibrate the confidence levels across all correct responses. By incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into the advantage estimation, our method dynamically reshapes the reward signal to attenuate the gradient updates of over-confident reasoning paths, while redistributing probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, effectively achieving a superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks show that ProGRPO significantly mitigates entropy collapse. Specifically, on Qwen2.5-7B, our method outperforms GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and, notably, by 13.9% in Pass@32, highlighting its superior capability in generating diverse correct reasoning paths.

*Minhuan Li,Jiequn Han,Pilar Cossio,Luhuan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EmbedOpt: A new method for steering diffusion models to generate biomolecular conformations that satisfy experimental constraints by optimizing in the conditional embedding space rather than directly on atomic coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Posterior sampling in diffusion models struggles when target conformations lie in low-density regions of the prior, requiring aggressive and brittle likelihood weighting. This limitation motivates an alternative approach that can better handle experimental constraints.

Method: EmbedOpt optimizes experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space of diffusion models, which encodes rich sequence and coevolutionary signals. This effectively shifts the diffusion prior to align with experimental constraints rather than directly manipulating atomic coordinates.

Result: EmbedOpt outperforms coordinate-based posterior sampling in cryo-EM map fitting tasks, matches performance on distance constraint tasks, and shows superior robustness across hyperparameters spanning two orders of magnitude. It also enables significant reduction in diffusion steps for better efficiency.

Conclusion: Optimizing in the conditional embedding space provides a more robust and efficient approach for steering diffusion models to satisfy experimental constraints in biomolecular conformation generation, overcoming limitations of traditional posterior sampling methods.

Abstract: In many biophysical inverse problems, the goal is to generate biomolecular conformations that are both physically plausible and consistent with experimental measurements. As recent sequence-to-structure diffusion models provide powerful data-driven priors, posterior sampling has emerged as a popular framework by guiding atomic coordinates to target conformations using experimental likelihoods. However, when the target lies in a low-density region of the prior, posterior sampling requires aggressive and brittle weighting of the likelihood guidance. Motivated by this limitation, we propose EmbedOpt, an alternative inference-time approach for steering diffusion models to optimize experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space. As this space encodes rich sequence and coevolutionary signals, optimizing over it effectively shifts the diffusion prior to align with experimental constraints. We validate EmbedOpt on two benchmarks simulating cryo-electron microscopy map fitting and experimental distance constraints. We show that EmbedOpt outperforms the coordinate-based posterior sampling method in map fitting tasks, matches performance on distance constraint tasks, and exhibits superior engineering robustness across hyperparameters spanning two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its smooth optimization behavior enables a significant reduction in the number of diffusion steps required for inference, leading to better efficiency.

Motivation: Existing healthcare visit prediction methods treat it as time-series forecasting without considering spatial dependencies between facility types and fail to provide reliable predictions during public emergencies/abnormal situations.

Method: Three key components: 1) Unified Spatiotemporal Context Encoder fusing heterogeneous static/dynamic information, 2) GraphMamba (Graph State Space Model) for hierarchical spatiotemporal modeling, 3) comprehensive uncertainty quantification module with three uncertainty mechanisms.

Result: Evaluated on four large-scale real-world datasets from California, New York, Texas, and Florida. Achieves ~6.0% improvement in prediction accuracy and ~3.5% improvement in uncertainty quantification over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: HealthMamba advances healthcare facility visit prediction by incorporating spatial dependencies and uncertainty awareness, providing more accurate and reliable predictions especially during abnormal situations like public emergencies.

Abstract: Healthcare facility visit prediction is essential for optimizing healthcare resource allocation and informing public health policy. Despite advanced machine learning methods being employed for better prediction performance, existing works usually formulate this task as a time-series forecasting problem without considering the intrinsic spatial dependencies of different types of healthcare facilities, and they also fail to provide reliable predictions under abnormal situations such as public emergencies. To advance existing research, we propose HealthMamba, an uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal framework for accurate and reliable healthcare facility visit prediction. HealthMamba comprises three key components: (i) a Unified Spatiotemporal Context Encoder that fuses heterogeneous static and dynamic information, (ii) a novel Graph State Space Model called GraphMamba for hierarchical spatiotemporal modeling, and (iii) a comprehensive uncertainty quantification module integrating three uncertainty quantification mechanisms for reliable prediction. We evaluate HealthMamba on four large-scale real-world datasets from California, New York, Texas, and Florida. Results show HealthMamba achieves around 6.0% improvement in prediction accuracy and 3.5% improvement in uncertainty quantification over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing analyses for stochastic variance-reduced algorithms (SAG, SAGA, IAG) are disparate and complex, with SAG's original proof being notoriously involved. There's a need for a unified, simpler analysis approach.

Method: Developed a unified convergence analysis with two key steps: (1) bounding delays from stochastic sub-sampling using concentration tools, and (2) designing a novel Lyapunov function that accounts for such delays.

Result: First high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA that extend to non-convex objectives and Markov sampling. Best known rates for IAG algorithm, significantly improving prior bounds.

Conclusion: Provides short, modular proof that unifies analysis of SAG, SAGA, and IAG algorithms, offering improved theoretical understanding and practical implications for large-scale optimization.

Abstract: Stochastic variance-reduced algorithms such as Stochastic Average Gradient (SAG) and SAGA, and their deterministic counterparts like the Incremental Aggregated Gradient (IAG) method, have been extensively studied in large-scale machine learning. Despite their popularity, existing analyses for these algorithms are disparate, relying on different proof techniques tailored to each method. Furthermore, the original proof of SAG is known to be notoriously involved, requiring computer-aided analysis. Focusing on finite-sum optimization with smooth and strongly convex objective functions, our main contribution is to develop a single unified convergence analysis that applies to all three algorithms: SAG, SAGA, and IAG. Our analysis features two key steps: (i) establishing a bound on delays due to stochastic sub-sampling using simple concentration tools, and (ii) carefully designing a novel Lyapunov function that accounts for such delays. The resulting proof is short and modular, providing the first high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA that can be seamlessly extended to non-convex objectives and Markov sampling. As an immediate byproduct of our new analysis technique, we obtain the best known rates for the IAG algorithm, significantly improving upon prior bounds.

*Yinan Huang,Hans Hao-Hsun Hsu,Junran Wang,Bo Dai,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sequential Flow Matching: A Bayesian filtering framework for efficient real-time streaming inference that accelerates sampling by using previous posterior as warm start instead of repeated sampling from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion and flow-matching models for sequential prediction require repeated sampling from non-informative initial distributions in streaming environments, causing substantial inference latency and potential system backlogs.

Method: Treats streaming inference as learning a probability flow that transports predictive distribution from one time step to the next, aligning with recursive Bayesian belief updates. Initializes generation from previous posterior as principled warm start.

Result: Achieves performance competitive with full-step diffusion while requiring only one or very few sampling steps, enabling faster sampling across forecasting, decision-making and state estimation tasks.

Conclusion: Framing sequential inference via Bayesian filtering provides a principled perspective for efficient real-time deployment of flow-based models, with theoretical justification for accelerated sampling.

Abstract: Sequential prediction from streaming observations is a fundamental problem in stochastic dynamical systems, where inherent uncertainty often leads to multiple plausible futures. While diffusion and flow-matching models are capable of modeling complex, multi-modal trajectories, their deployment in real-time streaming environments typically relies on repeated sampling from a non-informative initial distribution, incurring substantial inference latency and potential system backlogs. In this work, we introduce Sequential Flow Matching, a principled framework grounded in Bayesian filtering. By treating streaming inference as learning a probability flow that transports the predictive distribution from one time step to the next, our approach naturally aligns with the recursive structure of Bayesian belief updates. We provide theoretical justification that initializing generation from the previous posterior offers a principled warm start that can accelerate sampling compared to naïve re-sampling. Across a wide range of forecasting, decision-making and state estimation tasks, our method achieves performance competitive with full-step diffusion while requiring only one or very few sampling steps, therefore with faster sampling. It suggests that framing sequential inference via Bayesian filtering provides a new and principled perspective towards efficient real-time deployment of flow-based models.

*Zifan Liu,Xinran Li,Shibo Chen,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAS is a novel offline safe RL algorithm that enhances stitching capabilities and better balances reward maximization with constraint satisfaction using goal functions and dataset augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GM-assisted offline safe RL methods struggle with two key challenges: inability to stitch optimal transitions from suboptimal trajectories, and difficulty balancing conflicting reward and cost targets.

Method: Proposes Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS) with: 1) dataset augmentation and relabeling at transition level for better stitching, 2) goal functions using expectile regression to estimate optimal achievable reward/cost goals, and 3) dataset reshaping for uniform reward-cost distribution.

Result: Empirical results show GAS achieves superior performance in balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: GAS effectively addresses the stitching and reward-cost balancing challenges in offline safe RL through dataset augmentation, goal function estimation, and distribution reshaping.

Abstract: Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL) aims to learn a policy to achieve high performance in sequential decision-making while satisfying constraints, using only pre-collected datasets. Recent works, inspired by the strong capabilities of Generative Models (GMs), reformulate decision-making in OSRL as a conditional generative process, where GMs generate desirable actions conditioned on predefined reward and cost values. However, GM-assisted methods face two major challenges in OSRL: (1) lacking the ability to "stitch" optimal transitions from suboptimal trajectories within the dataset, and (2) struggling to balance reward targets with cost targets, particularly when they are conflict. To address these issues, we propose Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel algorithm designed to enhance stitching capabilities while effectively balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction. To enhance the stitching ability, GAS first augments and relabels the dataset at the transition level, enabling the construction of high-quality trajectories from suboptimal ones. GAS also introduces novel goal functions, which estimate the optimal achievable reward and cost goals from the dataset. These goal functions, trained using expectile regression on the relabeled and augmented dataset, allow GAS to accommodate a broader range of reward-cost return pairs and achieve a better tradeoff between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to human-specified values. The estimated goals then guide policy training, ensuring robust performance under constrained settings. Furthermore, to improve training stability and efficiency, we reshape the dataset to achieve a more uniform reward-cost return distribution. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of GAS, demonstrating superior performance in balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to existing methods.

*Edward Berman,Luisa Li,Jung Yeon Park,Robin Walters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Relaxed unitary convolutions for GNNs on meshes balance smoothness preservation with natural smoothing in physical systems, outperforming unitary convolutions and other baselines on PDE tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard GNNs suffer from oversmoothing, while unitary convolutions preserve smoothness but may be overconstraining for physical systems where smoothness naturally increases (e.g., diffusion processes). Need to balance smoothness preservation with natural smoothing requirements.

Method: Propose relaxed unitary convolutions that balance smoothness preservation with natural smoothing. Also generalize unitary and relaxed unitary convolutions from graphs to meshes for surface PDEs.

Result: Relaxed unitary convolutions outperform unitary convolutions and several strong baselines (mesh-aware transformers, equivariant neural networks) on PDE tasks like heat/wave equations over complex meshes and weather forecasting.

Conclusion: Unitary convolutions hurt performance for dynamics modeling tasks where smoothness naturally increases. Relaxed unitary convolutions provide better balance and achieve superior performance on physical system modeling.

Abstract: Modern neural networks have shown promise for solving partial differential equations over surfaces, often by discretizing the surface as a mesh and learning with a mesh-aware graph neural network. However, graph neural networks suffer from oversmoothing, where a node's features become increasingly similar to those of its neighbors. Unitary graph convolutions, which are mathematically constrained to preserve smoothness, have been proposed to address this issue. Despite this, in many physical systems, such as diffusion processes, smoothness naturally increases and unitarity may be overconstraining. In this paper, we systematically study the smoothing effects of different GNNs for dynamics modeling and prove that unitary convolutions hurt performance for such tasks. We propose relaxed unitary convolutions that balance smoothness preservation with the natural smoothing required for physical systems. We also generalize unitary and relaxed unitary convolutions from graphs to meshes. In experiments on PDEs such as the heat and wave equations over complex meshes and on weather forecasting, we find that our method outperforms several strong baselines, including mesh-aware transformers and equivariant neural networks.

*Paribesh Regmi,Rui Li,Kishan K C*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bayesian framework that adaptively determines optimal neighborhood scopes for GNNs by modeling message-passing as a stochastic process with beta distribution, improving performance on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNNs require time-consuming two-stage approaches to find optimal neighborhood scopes (number of hops), which is biased by search space design. There's a need for adaptive scope determination that works for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Method: Model GNN message-passing as a stochastic process using a beta process to treat the number of hops as a random variable. This Bayesian framework simultaneously infers optimal neighborhood scopes and optimizes GNN parameters through joint inference.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows scope inference improves GNN expressivity. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate competitive/superior performance on node classification, compatibility with state-of-the-art GNN variants, and well-calibrated predictions.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian framework successfully adaptively determines neighborhood scopes for GNNs, overcoming limitations of manual search methods and working effectively across both homophilic and heterophilic graph types.

Abstract: The neighborhood scope (i.e., number of hops) where graph neural networks (GNNs) aggregate information to characterize a node's statistical property is critical to GNNs' performance. Two-stage approaches, training and validating GNNs for every pre-specified neighborhood scope to search for the best setting, is a time-consuming task and tends to be biased due to the search space design. How to adaptively determine proper neighborhood scopes for the aggregation process for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs remains largely unexplored. We thus propose to model the GNNs' message-passing behavior on a graph as a stochastic process by treating the number of hops as a beta process. This Bayesian framework allows us to infer the most plausible neighborhood scope for message aggregation simultaneously with the optimization of GNN parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that the scope inference improves the expressivity of a GNN. Experiments on benchmark homophilic and heterophilic datasets show that the proposed method is compatible with state-of-the-art GNN variants, achieving competitive or superior performance on the node classification task, and providing well-calibrated predictions.

*Hongyi Li,Han Lin,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HRT (Hinge Regression Tree) is a novel oblique decision tree method that reframes splits as non-linear least-squares problems using two linear predictors with max/min envelope, achieving fast convergence and universal approximation with compact structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oblique decision trees offer better decision boundaries than axis-aligned trees but learning high-quality oblique splits is NP-hard, and existing methods rely on slow search or heuristics without theoretical guarantees.

Method: HRT reframes each split as a non-linear least-squares problem using two linear predictors whose max/min envelope provides ReLU-like expressive power. Uses alternating fitting procedure equivalent to damped Newton (Gauss-Newton) method with backtracking line-search for monotonic convergence.

Result: HRT achieves fast, stable convergence with both fixed and adaptive damping. Proves universal approximation with O(δ²) rate. On synthetic and real-world benchmarks, matches or outperforms single-tree baselines with more compact structures.

Conclusion: HRT provides a theoretically grounded, efficient method for learning oblique decision trees with strong empirical performance and compact representations, addressing the NP-hard challenge of oblique split learning.

Abstract: Oblique decision trees combine the transparency of trees with the power of multivariate decision boundaries, but learning high-quality oblique splits is NP-hard, and practical methods still rely on slow search or theory-free heuristics. We present the Hinge Regression Tree (HRT), which reframes each split as a non-linear least-squares problem over two linear predictors whose max/min envelope induces ReLU-like expressive power. The resulting alternating fitting procedure is exactly equivalent to a damped Newton (Gauss-Newton) method within fixed partitions. We analyze this node-level optimization and, for a backtracking line-search variant, prove that the local objective decreases monotonically and converges; in practice, both fixed and adaptive damping yield fast, stable convergence and can be combined with optional ridge regularization. We further prove that HRT's model class is a universal approximator with an explicit $O(δ^2)$ approximation rate, and show on synthetic and real-world benchmarks that it matches or outperforms single-tree baselines with more compact structures.

*Jaewon Lee,Yongwoo Kim,Donghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EC framework addresses superficial forgetting in machine unlearning by enforcing forgetting throughout network hierarchy via multi-layer contrastive unlearning and deeply supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many unlearning methods show strong logit-level forgetting but preserve substantial information in internal feature representations (superficial forgetting), primarily altering only the final classifier while leaving intermediate representations unchanged.

Method: Erase at the Core (EC) framework integrates multi-layer contrastive unlearning on forget set with retain set preservation through deeply supervised learning. Attaches auxiliary modules to intermediate layers and applies both contrastive unlearning and cross-entropy losses at each supervision point with layer-wise weighted losses.

Result: EC achieves effective logit-level forgetting while substantially reducing representational similarity to original model across intermediate layers. It's model-agnostic and can be incorporated as plug-in module into existing unlearning methods, improving representation-level forgetting while maintaining retain set performance.

Conclusion: EC addresses the superficial forgetting problem by enforcing forgetting throughout the entire network hierarchy, providing a more comprehensive unlearning solution that works across model architectures and can enhance existing methods.

Abstract: Many approximate machine unlearning methods demonstrate strong logit-level forgetting -- such as near-zero accuracy on the forget set -- yet continue to preserve substantial information within their internal feature representations. We refer to this discrepancy as superficial forgetting. Recent studies indicate that most existing unlearning approaches primarily alter the final classifier, leaving intermediate representations largely unchanged and highly similar to those of the original model. To address this limitation, we introduce the Erase at the Core (EC), a framework designed to enforce forgetting throughout the entire network hierarchy. EC integrates multi-layer contrastive unlearning on the forget set with retain set preservation through deeply supervised learning. Concretely, EC attaches auxiliary modules to intermediate layers and applies both contrastive unlearning and cross-entropy losses at each supervision point, with layer-wise weighted losses. Experimental results show that EC not only achieves effective logit-level forgetting, but also substantially reduces representational similarity to the original model across intermediate layers. Furthermore, EC is model-agnostic and can be incorporated as a plug-in module into existing unlearning methods, improving representation-level forgetting while maintaining performance on the retain set.

TL;DR: DecompSSM: An end-to-end decomposition framework using three parallel deep state space model branches to capture trend, seasonal, and residual components for multivariate time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multivariate time series intertwine slow trends, multi-rate seasonalities, and irregular residuals, making forecasting challenging. Existing methods use rigid hand-crafted decompositions or generic end-to-end architectures that entangle components and underuse structure shared across variables.

Method: Proposes DecompSSM with three parallel deep state space model branches for trend, seasonal, and residual components. Features adaptive temporal scales via input-dependent predictor, refinement module for shared cross-variable context, and auxiliary loss enforcing reconstruction and orthogonality.

Result: Outperformed strong baselines across standard benchmarks (ECL, Weather, ETTm2, and PEMS04), indicating effectiveness of combining component-wise deep state space models and global context refinement.

Conclusion: DecompSSM effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by combining component-wise decomposition with deep state space models and cross-variable context refinement for improved multivariate time series forecasting.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for decision-making in domains such as weather, energy, and finance. It remains challenging because real-world sequences intertwine slow trends, multi-rate seasonalities, and irregular residuals. Existing methods often rely on rigid, hand-crafted decompositions or generic end-to-end architectures that entangle components and underuse structure shared across variables. To address these limitations, we propose DecompSSM, an end-to-end decomposition framework using three parallel deep state space model branches to capture trend, seasonal, and residual components. The model features adaptive temporal scales via an input-dependent predictor, a refinement module for shared cross-variable context, and an auxiliary loss that enforces reconstruction and orthogonality. Across standard benchmarks (ECL, Weather, ETTm2, and PEMS04), DecompSSM outperformed strong baselines, indicating the effectiveness of combining component-wise deep state space models and global context refinement.

*Wei Soon Cheong,Lian Lian Jiang,Jamie Ng Suat Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Foundation models for time-series forecasting show inconsistent performance with exogenous features in electricity demand forecasting, often underperforming simple baselines in stable climates like Singapore, challenging assumptions about their universal superiority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether time-series foundation models can effectively leverage exogenous features for electricity demand forecasting, which is critical for accurate predictions in energy markets.

Method: Empirical evaluation of foundation models (MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, Chronos-2) against baseline LSTM with reversible instance normalization across Singaporean and Australian electricity markets at hourly and daily granularities, using three feature configurations: all features, selected features, and target-only.

Result: Chronos-2 performed best among foundation models in zero-shot settings, but the simple baseline frequently outperformed all foundation models in Singapore's stable climate, especially for short-term horizons. Model architecture was critical - TTM's channel-mixing and Chronos-2's grouped attention consistently leveraged exogenous features effectively, while other approaches showed inconsistent benefits.

Conclusion: Foundation models demonstrate advantages primarily in variable climates, challenging assumptions about universal foundation model superiority and highlighting the need for domain-specific models in the energy domain.

Abstract: Time-series foundation models have emerged as a new paradigm for forecasting, yet their ability to effectively leverage exogenous features -- critical for electricity demand forecasting -- remains unclear. This paper empirically evaluates foundation models capable of modeling cross-channel correlations against a baseline LSTM with reversible instance normalization across Singaporean and Australian electricity markets at hourly and daily granularities. We systematically assess MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2 under three feature configurations: all features, selected features, and target-only. Our findings reveal highly variable effectiveness: while Chronos-2 achieves the best performance among foundation models (in zero-shot settings), the simple baseline frequently outperforms all foundation models in Singapore's stable climate, particularly for short-term horizons. Model architecture proves critical, with synergistic architectural implementations (TTM's channel-mixing, Chronos-2's grouped attention) consistently leveraging exogenous features, while other approaches show inconsistent benefits. Geographic context emerges as equally important, with foundation models demonstrating advantages primarily in variable climates. These results challenge assumptions about universal foundation model superiority and highlight the need for domain-specific models, specifically in the energy domain.

*Adda Akram Bendoukha,Aymen Boudguiga,Nesrine Kaaniche,Renaud Sirdey,Didem Demirag,Sébastien Gambs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A federated learning approach combining homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving aggregation with meta-classifiers for Byzantine filtering, achieving 90-94% Byzantine detection accuracy with minimal utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces privacy and security challenges including inference attacks and Byzantine behaviors. Existing solutions often address privacy (secure aggregation) and Byzantine resilience independently, creating a gap for approaches that achieve both simultaneously.

Method: 1) Train meta-classifiers on labeled shadow updates simulating various Byzantine attacks (backdoor, gradient-inversion, label-flipping, shuffling). 2) Use classifier outputs to reweight and cancel Byzantine encrypted updates. 3) Develop automated method for selecting optimal kernel and dimensionality hyperparameters for homomorphic inference over CKKS cryptosystem.

Result: Achieves 90-94% accuracy for identifying Byzantine updates on FEMNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and acsincome benchmarks. Marginal losses in model utility with encrypted inference runtimes of 6-24 seconds for inference and 9-26 seconds for overall aggregation.

Conclusion: Proposed approach successfully combines homomorphic encryption for privacy with meta-classifier filtering for Byzantine resilience, demonstrating effective simultaneous protection against both privacy threats and malicious behaviors in federated learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a collaborative model while preserving data privacy. However, the distributed nature of this approach still raises privacy and security issues, such as the exposure of sensitive data due to inference attacks and the influence of Byzantine behaviors on the trained model. In particular, achieving both secure aggregation and Byzantine resilience remains challenging, as existing solutions often address these aspects independently. In this work, we propose to address these challenges through a novel approach that combines homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving aggregation with property-inference-inspired meta-classifiers for Byzantine filtering. First, following the property-inference attacks blueprint, we train a set of filtering meta-classifiers on labeled shadow updates, reproducing a diverse ensemble of Byzantine misbehaviors in FL, including backdoor, gradient-inversion, label-flipping and shuffling attacks. The outputs of these meta-classifiers are then used to cancel the Byzantine encrypted updates by reweighting. Second, we propose an automated method for selecting the optimal kernel and the dimensionality hyperparameters with respect to homomorphic inference, aggregation constraints and efficiency over the CKKS cryptosystem. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive experiments the effectiveness of our approach against Byzantine participants on the FEMNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and acsincome benchmarks. More precisely, our SVM filtering achieves accuracies between $90$% and $94$% for identifying Byzantine updates at the cost of marginal losses in model utility and encrypted inference runtimes ranging from $6$ to $24$ seconds and from $9$ to $26$ seconds for an overall aggregation.

*Sheshansh Agrawal,Thien Hang Nguyen,Douwe Kiela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A tournament graph framework for efficient LLM-based document reranking that aggregates k-wise comparisons into global preference graphs, achieving better accuracy with fewer tokens than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM reranking methods are either heuristic-based and don't fully exploit ranking information, or are inefficient when they do. There's a need for a principled approach that maximizes information gain while minimizing computational cost.

Method: Introduces a tournament graph framework where k-document comparisons reveal complete pairwise preferences. These tournaments are aggregated into a global preference graph whose transitive closure yields additional orderings without extra model calls. The method includes formal rank certification, greedy query scheduling to maximize information gain for top-m items, and handles non-transitive preferences by collapsing cycles into equivalence classes for tiered rankings.

Result: Across 14 benchmarks and 5 LLMs, achieves Pareto dominance: matches or exceeds accuracy while requiring 25-40% fewer tokens than comparable approaches, and 7× fewer tokens than pairwise methods at near-identical quality.

Conclusion: The tournament graph framework provides a principled foundation for k-wise reranking that efficiently exploits LLM comparison information, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining or improving ranking accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as powerful zero-shot rerankers for retrieval-augmented generation, offering strong generalization without task-specific training. However, existing LLM reranking methods either rely on heuristics that fail to fully exploit the information revealed by each ranking decision or are inefficient when they do. We introduce a tournament graph framework that provides a principled foundation for $k$-wise reranking. Our key observation is that each $k$-document comparison reveals a complete tournament of $\binom{k}{2}$ pairwise preferences. These tournaments are aggregated into a global preference graph, whose transitive closure yields many additional orderings without further model invocations. We formalize when a candidate's rank is certifiably determined and design a query schedule that greedily maximizes information gain towards identifying the top-$m$ items. Our framework also gracefully handles non-transitive preferences - cycles induced by LLM judgments - by collapsing them into equivalence classes that yield principled tiered rankings. Empirically, across 14 benchmarks and 5 LLMs, our method achieves Pareto dominance over existing methods: matching or exceeding accuracy while requiring 25-40% fewer tokens than comparable approaches, and 7$\times$ fewer than pairwise methods at near-identical quality.

*Jan Malte Töpperwien,Aditya Mohan,Marius Lindauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep RL hyperparameter sensitivity is not inevitable but amplified by bootstrapping dynamics; offline goal-conditioned RL with quasimetric learning shows greater robustness than bootstrapped TD-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter sensitivity in Deep RL is widely accepted but unclear whether intrinsic to RL or exacerbated by specific training mechanisms. The paper investigates this in offline goal-conditioned RL where data distributions are fixed and non-stationarity can be controlled.

Method: Study offline goal-conditioned RL with fixed data distributions and controlled non-stationarity via scheduled data quality shifts. Compare two algorithms: HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric representation learning). Analyze varying data qualities under stationary and non-stationary regimes. Introduce inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic to explain algorithmic differences.

Result: Substantially greater robustness to hyperparameter changes than commonly reported for online RL, even under controlled non-stationarity. With modest expert data (~20%), QRL maintains broad stable near-optimal regions while HIQL exhibits sharp optima that drift across training phases. Bootstrapped objectives show stronger destructive gradient interference coinciding with hyperparameter sensitivity.

Conclusion: High sensitivity to hyperparameter changes in RL training is not inevitable but amplified by bootstrapping dynamics. Quasimetric representation learning offers more robust algorithmic objective design compared to bootstrapped TD-learning approaches.

Abstract: Hyperparameter sensitivity in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often accepted as unavoidable. However, it remains unclear whether it is intrinsic to the RL problem or exacerbated by specific training mechanisms. We investigate this question in offline goal-conditioned RL, where data distributions are fixed, and non-stationarity can be explicitly controlled via scheduled shifts in data quality. Additionally, we study varying data qualities under both stationary and non-stationary regimes, and cover two representative algorithms: HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric representation learning). Overall, we observe substantially greater robustness to changes in hyperparameter configurations than commonly reported for online RL, even under controlled non-stationarity. Once modest expert data is present ($\approx$ 20\%), QRL maintains broad, stable near-optimal regions, while HIQL exhibits sharp optima that drift significantly across training phases. To explain this divergence, we introduce an inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic. We find that bootstrapped objectives exhibit stronger destructive gradient interference, which coincides directly with hyperparameter sensitivity. These results suggest that high sensitivity to changes in hyperparameter configurations during training is not inevitable in RL, but is amplified by the dynamics of bootstrapping, offering a pathway toward more robust algorithmic objective design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified clipping framework for RLVR that generalizes existing methods using policy divergence measures, proposes the KL3 estimator as a key constraint, and shows it improves exploration and performance in mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods like GRPO use clipping likelihood ratios to ensure stable updates, but there's a need for a more principled understanding of how different policy divergence measures affect exploration and performance in policy optimization.

Method: The paper introduces a unified clipping framework that characterizes existing RLVR methods via general policy divergence measures (including likelihood ratios and KL divergences). It identifies the KL3 estimator as a key policy divergence constraint and shows it's mathematically equivalent to asymmetric ratio-based clipping that reallocates probability mass toward high-confidence actions.

Result: Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that incorporating the KL3 estimator into GRPO improves both training stability and final performance.

Conclusion: The unified framework provides a principled foundation for analyzing policy divergence measures, and the KL3-based constraint promotes stronger exploration while retaining simplicity, highlighting the importance of principled policy divergence constraints in policy optimization.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a critical paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Most existing RLVR methods, such as GRPO and its variants, ensure stable updates by constraining policy divergence through clipping likelihood ratios. This paper introduces a unified clipping framework that characterizes existing methods via a general notion of policy divergence, encompassing both likelihood ratios and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences and extending to alternative measures. The framework provides a principled foundation for systematically analyzing how different policy divergence measures affect exploration and performance. We further identify the KL3 estimator, a variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator of the KL divergence, as a key policy divergence constraint. We theoretically demonstrate that the KL3-based constraint is mathematically equivalent to an asymmetric ratio-based clipping that reallocates probability mass toward high-confidence actions, promoting stronger exploration while retaining the simplicity of GRPO-style methods. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating the KL3 estimator into GRPO improves both training stability and final performance, highlighting the importance of principled policy divergence constraints in policy optimization.

*Tao Huang,Rui Wang,Xiaofei Liu,Yi Qin,Li Duan,Liping Jing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EUQ is a fine-grained uncertainty quantification method that detects LVLM misbehaviors by measuring internal conflict and ignorance through evidence theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs produce unreliable/harmful content when faced with incompetent/adversarial inputs (misbehaviors like hallucinations, jailbreaks). Existing uncertainty methods only capture overall epistemic uncertainty and are ineffective at detecting these issues.

Method: Interpret model output features as supporting/opposing evidence, use Evidence Theory to model and aggregate evidence in a single forward pass, quantifying internal conflict and knowledge gaps.

Result: EUQ consistently outperforms baselines across four misbehavior categories (hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, OOD failures). Hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict, OOD failures to high ignorance.

Conclusion: EUQ provides fine-grained uncertainty quantification for detecting LVLM misbehaviors, offering interpretable insights through layer-wise uncertainty dynamics analysis.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown substantial advances in multimodal understanding and generation. However, when presented with incompetent or adversarial inputs, they frequently produce unreliable or even harmful content, such as fact hallucinations or dangerous instructions. This misalignment with human expectations, referred to as \emph{misbehaviors} of LVLMs, raises serious concerns for deployment in critical applications. These misbehaviors are found to stem from epistemic uncertainty, specifically either conflicting internal knowledge or the absence of supporting information. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods, which typically capture only overall epistemic uncertainty, have shown limited effectiveness in identifying such issues. To address this gap, we propose Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that captures both information conflict and ignorance for effective detection of LVLM misbehaviors. In particular, we interpret features from the model output head as either supporting (positive) or opposing (negative) evidence. Leveraging Evidence Theory, we model and aggregate this evidence to quantify internal conflict and knowledge gaps within a single forward pass. We extensively evaluate our method across four categories of misbehavior, including hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution (OOD) failures, using state-of-the-art LVLMs, and find that EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing that hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict and OOD failures to high ignorance. Furthermore, layer-wise evidential uncertainty dynamics analysis helps interpret the evolution of internal representations from a new perspective.

TL;DR: SVC is a training-free, data-free post-processing method that calibrates inflated singular values in merged models to address over-counting of shared knowledge across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods focus on resolving task conflicts but fail to address over-counting of shared knowledge, where aligned spectral directions get repeatedly accumulated during merging, inflating singular values and biasing models toward shared subspaces.

Method: Singular Value Calibration (SVC) quantifies subspace overlap between tasks and rescales inflated singular values to restore a balanced spectrum, operating as a training-free and data-free post-processing method applied after model merging.

Result: SVC consistently improves strong merging baselines across vision and language benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance and improving Task Arithmetic by 13.0% by modifying only singular values.

Conclusion: SVC effectively addresses the previously unaddressed problem of over-counting shared knowledge in model merging through spectral calibration, providing a simple yet powerful post-processing solution that enhances merged model performance.

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned models into a single model by adding their weight updates, providing a lightweight alternative to retraining. Existing methods primarily target resolving conflicts between task updates, leaving the failure mode of over-counting shared knowledge unaddressed. We show that when tasks share aligned spectral directions (i.e., overlapping singular vectors), a simple linear combination repeatedly accumulates these directions, inflating the singular values and biasing the merged model toward shared subspaces. To mitigate this issue, we propose Singular Value Calibration (SVC), a training-free and data-free post-processing method that quantifies subspace overlap and rescales inflated singular values to restore a balanced spectrum. Across vision and language benchmarks, SVC consistently improves strong merging baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by modifying only the singular values, SVC improves the performance of Task Arithmetic by 13.0%. Code is available at: https://github.com/lyymuwu/SVC.

### [260] [Steering Large Reasoning Models towards Concise Reasoning via Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05539)
*Yawei Li,Benjamin Bergner,Yinghan Zhao,Vihang Prakash Patil,Bei Chen,Cheng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowSteer: A nonlinear steering method using Flow Matching to transform verbose reasoning distributions into concise ones, improving token efficiency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) produce overly verbose outputs that reduce efficiency. Existing linear steering methods are limited by the restrictive linear representation hypothesis and apply uniform shifts that don't fully address the problem.

Method: FlowSteer learns a complete nonlinear transformation between verbose and concise reasoning distributions using Flow Matching. It models the transport as a velocity field, enabling precise, input-dependent control over the model's reasoning process by aligning steered representations with concise-reasoning activations.

Result: FlowSteer produces more compact reasoning than linear methods and demonstrates strong task performance and token efficiency across diverse reasoning benchmarks compared to leading inference-time baselines.

Conclusion: Modeling full distributional transport with generative techniques like Flow Matching provides a more effective and principled foundation for controlling LRMs than uniform linear shifts.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is often hampered by overly verbose outputs. Prior steering methods attempt to address this issue by applying a single, global vector to hidden representations -- an approach grounded in the restrictive linear representation hypothesis. In this work, we introduce FlowSteer, a nonlinear steering method that goes beyond uniform linear shifts by learning a complete transformation between the distributions associated with verbose and concise reasoning. This transformation is learned via Flow Matching as a velocity field, enabling precise, input-dependent control over the model's reasoning process. By aligning steered representations with the distribution of concise-reasoning activations, FlowSteer yields more compact reasoning than the linear shifts. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, FlowSteer demonstrates strong task performance and token efficiency compared to leading inference-time baselines. Our work demonstrates that modeling the full distributional transport with generative techniques offers a more effective and principled foundation for controlling LRMs.

### [261] [Unveiling Implicit Advantage Symmetry: Why GRPO Struggles with Exploration and Difficulty Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05548)
*Zhiqi Yu,Zhangquan Chen,Mengting Liu,Heye Zhang,Liangqiong Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in GRPO's Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) due to implicit advantage symmetry, proposes Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE) to dynamically modulate exploration and difficulty adaptation, and shows consistent improvements across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods like GRPO have efficiency bottlenecks in exploration and difficulty adaptation. The authors argue these stem from implicit advantage symmetry in GRAE, which hinders exploration of novel solutions and fails to adapt to non-stationary difficulty demands.

Method: Proposes Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE) that dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus. It asymmetrically suppresses advantages of correct trajectories to encourage exploration and implements a curriculum-like approach that prioritizes simpler samples initially before shifting to complex ones.

Result: Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that A-GRAE consistently improves GRPO and its variants across both LLMs and MLLMs.

Conclusion: The implicit advantage symmetry in GRAE is sub-optimal, and the proposed asymmetric approach with dynamic difficulty adaptation significantly enhances RLVR performance through better exploration and curriculum learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly GRPO, has become the standard for eliciting LLM reasoning. However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration. (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by a curriculum-like transition-prioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones. Motivated by these findings, we propose Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE), which dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that A-GRAE consistently improves GRPO and its variants across both LLMs and MLLMs.

TL;DR: LOGDIFF enables exact constrained generation in diffusion models using complex logical expressions at inference time through a Boolean calculus framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models lack principled methods for constrained generation with complex logical expressions, limiting their ability to generate samples that satisfy multiple compositional constraints simultaneously.

Method: Develops a Boolean calculus framework that provides sufficient conditions for exact logical guidance, where guidance signals for complex formulas can be computed exactly from atomic scores and posterior probabilities using efficient recursive algorithms. Also introduces hybrid guidance combining atomic scores with posterior estimates.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on multiple image and protein structure generation tasks, showing that exact logical guidance is achievable for formulas meeting certain circuit representation conditions.

Conclusion: LOGDIFF provides a principled framework for exact constrained generation with complex logical expressions in diffusion models, bridging classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance approaches.

Abstract: We propose LOGDIFF (Logical Guidance for the Exact Composition of Diffusion Models), a guidance framework for diffusion models that enables principled constrained generation with complex logical expressions at inference time.
  We study when exact score-based guidance for complex logical formulas can be obtained from guidance signals associated with atomic properties.
  First, we derive an exact Boolean calculus that provides a sufficient condition for exact logical guidance.
  Specifically, if a formula admits a circuit representation in which conjunctions combine conditionally independent subformulas and disjunctions combine subformulas that are either conditionally independent or mutually exclusive, exact logical guidance is achievable.
  In this case, the guidance signal can be computed exactly from atomic scores and posterior probabilities using an efficient recursive algorithm.
  Moreover, we show that, for commonly encountered classes of distributions, any desired Boolean formula is compilable into such a circuit representation.
  Second, by combining atomic guidance scores with posterior probability estimates, we introduce a hybrid guidance approach that bridges classifierguidance and classifier-free guidance, applicable to both compositional logical guidance and standard conditional generation.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on multiple image and protein structure generation tasks.

Motivation: Pre-trained GNNs transfer well but adapting them to downstream tasks is challenging due to mismatches between pre-training objectives and task requirements. Existing graph prompt tuning methods only modify inputs or representations, leaving message passing unchanged and limiting their ability to adapt neighborhood interactions.

Method: Inject learnable prompts into the message passing step to reweight incoming neighbor messages and add task-specific prompt vectors during message aggregation, while keeping the backbone GNN frozen. The approach is compatible with common GNN backbones and pre-training strategies.

*Rishabh Bhattacharya,Naresh Manwani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EdgeMask-DG*: A graph domain generalization method using adversarial edge masking on feature-enriched graphs to find domain-invariant structural information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks struggle with structural shifts across domains because graph topology acts as a covariate that varies. Existing methods use fixed augmentations or global perturbations that don't identify which specific edges encode domain-invariant information.

Method: First propose EdgeMask-DG: a min-max algorithm where an edge masker learns worst-case continuous masks under sparsity constraints, forcing a task GNN to perform well under adversarial structural perturbations. Then introduce EdgeMask-DG*: extends this adversarial masking to an enriched graph combining original topology with feature-derived edges, allowing invariance discovery even with noisy or domain-specific topology.

Result: Achieves new SOTA on diverse graph domain generalization benchmarks (citation networks, social networks, temporal graphs). On Cora OOD benchmark, lifts worst-case domain accuracy to 78.0% (+3.8 pp improvement over prior SOTA of 74.2%).

Conclusion: EdgeMask-DG* is the first to systematically combine adaptive adversarial topology search with feature-enriched graphs, providing formal justification from robust optimization perspective and demonstrating superior performance in finding domain-invariant structural information.

Abstract: Structural shifts pose a significant challenge for graph neural networks, as graph topology acts as a covariate that can vary across domains. Existing domain generalization methods rely on fixed structural augmentations or training on globally perturbed graphs, mechanisms that do not pinpoint which specific edges encode domain-invariant information. We argue that domain-invariant structural information is not rigidly tied to a single topology but resides in the consensus across multiple graph structures derived from topology and feature similarity. To capture this, we first propose EdgeMask-DG, a novel min-max algorithm where an edge masker learns to find worst-case continuous masks subject to a sparsity constraint, compelling a task GNN to perform effectively under these adversarial structural perturbations. Building upon this, we introduce EdgeMask-DG*, an extension that applies this adversarial masking principle to an enriched graph. This enriched graph combines the original topology with feature-derived edges, allowing the model to discover invariances even when the original topology is noisy or domain-specific. EdgeMask-DG* is the first to systematically combine adaptive adversarial topology search with feature-enriched graphs. We provide a formal justification for our approach from a robust optimization perspective. We demonstrate that EdgeMask-DG* achieves new state-of-the-art performance on diverse graph domain generalization benchmarks, including citation networks, social networks, and temporal graphs. Notably, on the Cora OOD benchmark, EdgeMask-DG* lifts the worst-case domain accuracy to 78.0\%, a +3.8 pp improvement over the prior state of the art (74.2\%).

Abstract: Multimodal-Attributed Graph (MAG) learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling complex real-world systems by integrating graph topology with rich attributes from multiple modalities. With the rapid proliferation of novel MAG models capable of handling intricate cross-modal semantics and structural dependencies, establishing a rigorous and unified evaluation standard has become imperative.

### [266] [On the Superlinear Relationship between SGD Noise Covariance and Loss Landscape Curvature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05600)
*Yikuan Zhang,Ning Yang,Yuhai Tu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGD noise covariance C is not proportional to Hessian H in deep networks; instead C ∝ E[h_p²] where h_p is per-sample Hessian, leading to C and H commuting approximately with diagonal elements following C_ii ∝ H_ii^γ where 1 ≤ γ ≤ 2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work incorrectly assumes equivalence between Fisher Information Matrix and Hessian for negative log-likelihood losses, claiming SGD noise covariance C is proportional to Hessian H. This assumption holds only under restrictive conditions typically violated in deep neural networks.

Method: Using Activity-Weight Duality to derive a more general relationship agnostic to specific loss formulation. Shows C ∝ E[h_p²] where h_p denotes per-sample Hessian with H = E[h_p]. Theoretical analysis establishes that C and H commute approximately rather than coincide exactly.

Result: Diagonal elements follow approximate power-law relation C_ii ∝ H_ii^γ with theoretically bounded exponent 1 ≤ γ ≤ 2, determined by per-sample Hessian spectra. Experiments across datasets, architectures, and loss functions validate these bounds.

Conclusion: Provides unified characterization of noise-curvature relationship in deep learning, correcting prior misconceptions about SGD noise structure and establishing general theoretical bounds on the relationship between noise covariance and Hessian curvature.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) introduces anisotropic noise that is correlated with the local curvature of the loss landscape, thereby biasing optimization toward flat minima. Prior work often assumes an equivalence between the Fisher Information Matrix and the Hessian for negative log-likelihood losses, leading to the claim that the SGD noise covariance $\mathbf{C}$ is proportional to the Hessian $\mathbf{H}$. We show that this assumption holds only under restrictive conditions that are typically violated in deep neural networks. Using the recently discovered Activity--Weight Duality, we find a more general relationship agnostic to the specific loss formulation, showing that $\mathbf{C} \propto \mathbb{E}_p[\mathbf{h}_p^2]$, where $\mathbf{h}_p$ denotes the per-sample Hessian with $\mathbf{H} = \mathbb{E}_p[\mathbf{h}_p]$. As a consequence, $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ commute approximately rather than coincide exactly, and their diagonal elements follow an approximate power-law relation $C_{ii} \propto H_{ii}^γ$ with a theoretically bounded exponent $1 \leq γ\leq 2$, determined by per-sample Hessian spectra. Experiments across datasets, architectures, and loss functions validate these bounds, providing a unified characterization of the noise-curvature relationship in deep learning.

TL;DR: Shiva-DiT: A differentiable pruning method for Diffusion Transformers that uses residual-based top-k selection to achieve deterministic token counts for hardware efficiency while maintaining learnability, achieving 1.54× speedup with better fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have prohibitive computational costs due to quadratic self-attention scaling. Existing pruning methods fail to simultaneously satisfy differentiability, efficiency, and strict static hardware budgets required for compilation.

Method: Proposes Shiva-DiT with Residual-Based Differentiable Top-k Selection using a residual-aware straight-through estimator for deterministic token counts while preserving end-to-end learnability. Also introduces Context-Aware Router and Adaptive Ratio Policy to learn adaptive pruning schedules autonomously.

Result: Establishes new Pareto frontier, achieving 1.54× wall-clock speedup with superior fidelity compared to existing baselines, effectively eliminating ragged tensor overheads. Demonstrated on mainstream models including SD3.5.

Conclusion: Shiva-DiT effectively reconciles conflicting requirements of differentiability, efficiency, and strict static hardware budgets for Diffusion Transformers, enabling practical acceleration while maintaining model quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) incur prohibitive computational costs due to the quadratic scaling of self-attention. Existing pruning methods fail to simultaneously satisfy differentiability, efficiency, and the strict static budgets required for hardware overhead. To address this, we propose Shiva-DiT, which effectively reconciles these conflicting requirements via Residual-Based Differentiable Top-$k$ Selection. By leveraging a residual-aware straight-through estimator, our method enforces deterministic token counts for static compilation while preserving end-to-end learnability through residual gradient estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a Context-Aware Router and Adaptive Ratio Policy to autonomously learn an adaptive pruning schedule. Experiments on mainstream models, including SD3.5, demonstrate that Shiva-DiT establishes a new Pareto frontier, achieving a 1.54$\times$ wall-clock speedup with superior fidelity compared to existing baselines, effectively eliminating ragged tensor overheads.

TL;DR: PGFM is a flow matching-based dataset distillation method that enables fast deterministic synthesis with ODE-consistent path control, outperforming diffusion-based approaches with 7.6× efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based dataset distillation methods suffer from time-consuming sampling, trajectory instability, and poor generalization under strong control or low IPC settings due to heuristic guidance and prototype assignment issues.

Method: Proposes Path-Guided Flow Matching (PGFM) framework that: 1) conducts flow matching in latent space of frozen VAE, 2) learns class-conditional transport from Gaussian noise to data distribution, and 3) introduces continuous path-to-prototype guidance for ODE-consistent path control.

Result: PGFM matches or surpasses prior diffusion-based distillation approaches with fewer sampling steps, achieves competitive performance with remarkably improved efficiency (7.6× more efficient than diffusion-based counterparts with 78% mode coverage).

Conclusion: PGFM provides an efficient, stable, and effective flow matching-based alternative to diffusion methods for dataset distillation, enabling fast deterministic synthesis with reliable prototype assignment while preserving diversity.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic sets with comparable performance in training models. Despite recent progress on diffusion-based distillation, this type of method typically depends on heuristic guidance or prototype assignment, which comes with time-consuming sampling and trajectory instability and thus hurts downstream generalization especially under strong control or low IPC. We propose \emph{Path-Guided Flow Matching (PGFM)}, the first flow matching-based framework for generative distillation, which enables fast deterministic synthesis by solving an ODE in a few steps. PGFM conducts flow matching in the latent space of a frozen VAE to learn class-conditional transport from Gaussian noise to data distribution. Particularly, we develop a continuous path-to-prototype guidance algorithm for ODE-consistent path control, which allows trajectories to reliably land on assigned prototypes while preserving diversity and efficiency. Extensive experiments across high-resolution benchmarks demonstrate that PGFM matches or surpasses prior diffusion-based distillation approaches with fewer steps of sampling while delivering competitive performance with remarkably improved efficiency, e.g., 7.6$\times$ more efficient than the diffusion-based counterparts with 78\% mode coverage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mode-dependent architectural components (Batch Normalization, dropout) are common in visual RL but destabilize on-policy optimization like PPO, causing training-evaluation discrepancies that lead to policy mismatch and reward collapse.

Method: Proposes Mode-Dependent Rectification (MDR), a lightweight dual-phase training procedure that stabilizes PPO under mode-dependent layers without requiring architectural changes.

Result: Experiments across procedurally generated games and real-world patch-localization tasks show MDR consistently improves stability and performance, and extends naturally to other mode-dependent layers.

Conclusion: MDR effectively addresses the instability caused by mode-dependent layers in PPO, providing a practical solution that works across different domains without modifying network architectures.

Abstract: Mode-dependent architectural components (layers that behave differently during training and evaluation, such as Batch Normalization or dropout) are commonly used in visual reinforcement learning but can destabilize on-policy optimization. We show that in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), discrepancies between training and evaluation behavior induced by Batch Normalization lead to policy mismatch, distributional drift, and reward collapse. We propose Mode-Dependent Rectification (MDR), a lightweight dual-phase training procedure that stabilizes PPO under mode-dependent layers without architectural changes. Experiments across procedurally generated games and real-world patch-localization tasks demonstrate that MDR consistently improves stability and performance, and extends naturally to other mode-dependent layers.

TL;DR: REAL reformulates RLVR as classification using rewards as categorical labels, addressing gradient misassignment issues in GRPO variants to improve training stability and performance on math reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods like GRPO suffer from Gradient Misassignment in Positives and Gradient Domination in Negatives, leading to inefficient and suboptimal policy updates in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Method: Proposes Rewards as Labels (REAL) framework that treats verifiable rewards as categorical labels instead of scalar weights, reformulating policy optimization as classification. Introduces anchor logits to enhance policy learning.

Result: REAL improves training stability and outperforms GRPO and variants like DAPO on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. On 1.5B model: +6.7% average Pass@1 over DAPO; on 7B model: +6.2% over DAPO, +1.7% over GSPO. Even with vanilla binary cross-entropy, REAL exceeds DAPO by 4.5%.

Conclusion: REAL effectively addresses gradient misassignment issues in RLVR methods by treating rewards as categorical labels, enabling balanced gradient allocation and improving both training stability and performance across different model scales.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has recently advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models in complex reasoning tasks by providing explicit rule-based supervision. Among RLVR methods, GRPO and its variants have achieved strong empirical performance. Despite their success, we identify that they suffer from Gradient Misassignment in Positives and Gradient Domination in Negatives, which lead to inefficient and suboptimal policy updates. To address these issues, we propose Rewards as Labels (REAL), a novel framework that revisits verifiable rewards as categorical labels rather than scalar weights, thereby reformulating policy optimization as a classification problem. Building on this, we further introduce anchor logits to enhance policy learning. Our analysis reveals that REAL induces a monotonic and bounded gradient weighting, enabling balanced gradient allocation across rollouts and effectively mitigating the identified mismatches. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that REAL improves training stability and consistently outperforms GRPO and strong variants such as DAPO. On the 1.5B model, REAL improves average Pass@1 over DAPO by 6.7%. These gains further scale to 7B model, REAL continues to outperform DAPO and GSPO by 6.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Notably, even with a vanilla binary cross-entropy, REAL remains stable and exceeds DAPO by 4.5% on average.

*Ojasva Nema,Kaustubh Sharma,Aditya Chauhan,Parikshit Pareek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bilinear MLPs with multiplicative interactions enable better structural disentanglement for selective unlearning and long-horizon extrapolation compared to standard nonlinear networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selective unlearning and long-horizon extrapolation remain fragile in modern neural networks, even when tasks have underlying algebraic structure. The authors argue these failures arise from how models structure their internal representations during training, not just from optimization or unlearning algorithms.

Method: The paper explores using explicit multiplicative interactions as an architectural inductive bias through Bilinear MLPs. They show analytically that bilinear parameterizations possess a 'non-mixing' property under gradient flow conditions, where functional components separate into orthogonal subspace representations.

Result: Through controlled experiments on modular arithmetic, cyclic reasoning, Lie group dynamics, and targeted unlearning benchmarks, multiplicative architectures are able to recover true operators aligned with underlying algebraic structure, unlike pointwise nonlinear networks.

Conclusion: Model editability and generalization are constrained by representational structure, and architectural inductive bias (specifically multiplicative interactions) plays a central role in enabling reliable unlearning and structural disentanglement.

Abstract: Selective unlearning and long-horizon extrapolation remain fragile in modern neural networks, even when tasks have underlying algebraic structure. In this work, we argue that these failures arise not solely from optimization or unlearning algorithms, but from how models structure their internal representations during training. We explore if having explicit multiplicative interactions as an architectural inductive bias helps in structural disentanglement, through Bilinear MLPs. We show analytically that bilinear parameterizations possess a `non-mixing' property under gradient flow conditions, where functional components separate into orthogonal subspace representations. This provides a mathematical foundation for surgical model modification. We validate this hypothesis through a series of controlled experiments spanning modular arithmetic, cyclic reasoning, Lie group dynamics, and targeted unlearning benchmarks. Unlike pointwise nonlinear networks, multiplicative architectures are able to recover true operators aligned with the underlying algebraic structure. Our results suggest that model editability and generalization are constrained by representational structure, and that architectural inductive bias plays a central role in enabling reliable unlearning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable self-supervised learning of probabilistic representations in a reconstruction-free, non-contrastive setting, addressing limitations of energy-based predictive objectives that optimize pointwise discrepancies.

Method: VJE maximizes a symmetric conditional ELBO for latent-variable models on encoder embeddings, using Student-t likelihood with polar decomposition to decouple directional and radial factors, with amortized inference network parameterizing diagonal Gaussian variational posterior.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to standard non-contrastive baselines on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10/100, and STL-10 under linear/k-NN evaluation, and outperforms comparable self-supervised baselines in one-class CIFAR-10 anomaly detection using likelihood-based scoring.

Conclusion: VJE successfully synthesizes joint embedding and variational inference for probabilistic self-supervised learning, providing effective uncertainty modeling and anomaly detection capabilities while maintaining competitive representation quality.

Abstract: We introduce Variational Joint Embedding (VJE), a framework that synthesizes joint embedding and variational inference to enable self-supervised learning of probabilistic representations in a reconstruction-free, non-contrastive setting. Compared to energy-based predictive objectives that optimize pointwise discrepancies, VJE maximizes a symmetric conditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) for a latent-variable model defined directly on encoder embeddings. We instantiate the conditional likelihood with a heavy-tailed Student-$t$ model using a polar decomposition that explicitly decouples directional and radial factors to prevent norm-induced instabilities during training. VJE employs an amortized inference network to parameterize a diagonal Gaussian variational posterior whose feature-wise variances are shared with the likelihood scale to capture anisotropic uncertainty without auxiliary projection heads. Across ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10/100, and STL-10, VJE achieves performance comparable to standard non-contrastive baselines under linear and k-NN evaluation. We further validate these probabilistic semantics through one-class CIFAR-10 anomaly detection, where likelihood-based scoring under the proposed model outperforms comparable self-supervised baselines.

Motivation: Existing time series foundation models rely on unimodal pretraining and lack complementary modalities to enhance understanding. There's a need for unified multimodal pretraining paradigms and effective integration of heterogeneous modalities to improve generalization.

Method: 1) Proposed multimodal pretraining paradigm using time series with endogenous modalities (derived images/text) and exogenous knowledge (real-world news). 2) Developed automated pipeline to create MM-TS dataset (first large-scale multimodal time series dataset with up to 1B points across 6 domains). 3) Designed HORAI model with Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and Time-Frequency Decoder for effective multimodal fusion and generalization.

Result: After pretraining on MM-TS, HORAI achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating strong generalization across modalities and domains.

Conclusion: HORAI represents an early step toward multimodal foundation models for time series analysis, successfully addressing key challenges of unified multimodal pretraining and effective modality integration, while showing promising generalization capabilities.

Abstract: While existing time series foundation models primarily rely on large-scale unimodal pretraining, they lack complementary modalities to enhance time series understanding. Building multimodal foundation models is a natural next step, but it faces key challenges: 1) lack of a unified multimodal pretraining paradigm and large-scale multimodal corpora for time series analysis; 2) how to effectively integrate heterogeneous modalities and enhance model generalization. To address these challenges, we take an early step toward multimodal foundation models for time series analysis. We first propose a multimodal pretraining paradigm that leverages time series with endogenous modalities (derived images and text) and exogenous knowledge (real-world news), providing a comprehensive multi-view perspective for time series analysis. To support this, we develop an automated data construction pipeline to curate MM-TS, the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset spanning six domains, with up to one billion points. Then we propose HORAI, a frequency-enhanced multimodal foundation model. It integrates two core components: the Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and the Time-Frequency Decoder, designed to effectively fuse multimodal features and enhance model generalization across modalities and domains. After pretraining on MM-TS, HORAI achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating strong generalization.

TL;DR: TACO is a tabular compression model that compresses training data into latent space, achieving up to 94x faster inference and 97% less memory than state-of-the-art tabular transformers while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular foundation models using transformers have quadratic complexity with dataset size, causing high training/inference overhead and limiting scalability for large datasets, despite their state-of-the-art performance.

Method: TACO is an end-to-end tabular compression model that compresses the training dataset into a latent space representation, reducing computational complexity while preserving predictive capabilities.

Result: On TabArena benchmark: 94x faster inference, 97% less memory consumption compared to SOTA tabular transformers, with no significant performance degradation. Better scaling with larger datasets and improved performance over other baselines.

Conclusion: TACO provides an efficient alternative to transformer-based tabular foundation models by compressing data into latent space, enabling faster inference, lower memory usage, and better scalability while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: The long-standing dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees for tabular data has recently been challenged by in-context learning tabular foundation models. In-context learning methods fit and predict in one forward pass without parameter updates by leveraging the training data as context for predicting on query test points. While recent tabular foundation models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their transformer architecture based on the attention mechanism has quadratic complexity regarding dataset size, which in turn increases the overhead on training and inference time, and limits the capacity of the models to handle large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose TACO, an end-to-end tabular compression model that compresses the training dataset in a latent space. We test our method on the TabArena benchmark, where our proposed method is up to 94x faster in inference time, while consuming up to 97\% less memory compared to the state-of-the-art tabular transformer architecture, all while retaining performance without significant degradation. Lastly, our method not only scales better with increased dataset sizes, but it also achieves better performance compared to other baselines.

### [275] [Alignment Verifiability in Large Language Models: Normative Indistinguishability under Behavioral Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05656)
*Igor Santos-Grueiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Behavioral evaluation cannot uniquely identify latent alignment in LLMs; observed compliance doesn't guarantee underlying alignment properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment evaluation practices treat behavioral compliance as evidence of underlying alignment, but this inference step is rarely analyzed formally. The paper aims to formally study whether behavioral evidence can actually identify latent alignment properties.

Method: Frames alignment evaluation as an identifiability problem under partial observability, introduces the Alignment Verifiability Problem and Normative Indistinguishability concept, and proves a negative identifiability theorem showing behavioral compliance doesn't uniquely identify latent alignment.

Result: Main theorem shows that under finite behavioral evaluation with evaluation-aware agents, observed behavioral compliance does NOT uniquely identify latent alignment. Behavioral tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment.

Conclusion: Behavioral alignment benchmarks provide upper bounds on observable compliance within a regime, not guarantees of underlying alignment. Passing tests reduces the space of compatible hypotheses but cannot collapse it to a single alignment hypothesis.

Abstract: Behavioral evaluation is the dominant paradigm for assessing alignment in large language models (LLMs). In practice, alignment is inferred from performance under finite evaluation protocols - benchmarks, red-teaming suites, or automated pipelines - and observed compliance is often treated as evidence of underlying alignment. This inference step, from behavioral evidence to claims about latent alignment properties, is typically implicit and rarely analyzed as an inference problem in its own right.
  We study this problem formally. We frame alignment evaluation as an identifiability question under partial observability and allow agent behavior to depend on information correlated with the evaluation regime. Within this setting, we introduce the Alignment Verifiability Problem and the notion of Normative Indistinguishability, capturing when distinct latent alignment hypotheses induce identical distributions over all evaluator-accessible signals.
  Our main result is a negative but sharply delimited identifiability theorem. Under finite behavioral evaluation and evaluation-aware agents, observed behavioral compliance does not uniquely identify latent alignment. That is, even idealized behavioral evaluation cannot, in general, certify alignment as a latent property.
  We further show that behavioral alignment tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment. Passing increasingly stringent tests may reduce the space of compatible hypotheses, but cannot collapse it to a singleton under the stated conditions. This reframes alignment benchmarks as providing upper bounds on observable compliance within a regime, rather than guarantees of underlying alignment.

*Aleksandar Armacki,Dragana Bajović,Dušan Jakovetić,Soummya Kar,Ali H. Sayed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the long-term tail decay rates of SGD-based methods using large deviations theory, showing significantly faster decay rates than existing finite-time bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work on SGD tail behavior focuses on finite-time high-probability guarantees, lacking analysis of long-term tail decay rates which are more relevant for modern deep learning models trained for millions of iterations.

Method: The authors use large deviations theory to study long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods, analyzing both vanilla SGD with bounded noise and clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moments.

Result: For vanilla SGD with non-convex costs and bounded noise: upper bound decay rate e^{-t/log(t)}. For c-SGD with heavy-tailed noise (p ∈ (1,2]): decay rate e^{-t^{β_p}/log(t)} where β_p = 4(p-1)/(3p-2) for p∈(1,2) and e^{-t/log²(t)} for p=2. Lower bounds show these rates are tight up to poly-log factors.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates order-of-magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing finite-time bounds, uncovering regimes where SGD tails decay much faster than previously known, providing stronger long-term guarantees for individual algorithm runs.

Abstract: The study of tail behaviour of SGD-induced processes has been attracting a lot of interest, due to offering strong guarantees with respect to individual runs of an algorithm. While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{β_p}/\log(t)}$, where $β_p = \frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$. Finally, we provide lower bounds on the tail decay, at rate $e^{-t}$, showing that our rates for both SGD and c-SGD are tight, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Notably, our results demonstrate an order of magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing work based on finite-time bounds, which show rates $e^{-\sqrt{t}}$ and $e^{-t^{β_p/2}}$, $p \in (1,2]$, for SGD and c-SGD, respectively. As such, we uncover regimes where the tails decay much faster than previously known, providing stronger long-term guarantees for individual runs.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) generation introduces significant uncertainty into power system operation, necessitating forecasting approaches that extend beyond deterministic point predictions. This paper proposes an any-quantile probabilistic forecasting framework for multi-regional PV power generation based on the Any-Quantile Recurrent Neural Network (AQ-RNN). The model integrates an any-quantile forecasting paradigm with a dual-track recurrent architecture that jointly processes series-specific and cross-regional contextual information, supported by dilated recurrent cells, patch-based temporal modeling, and a dynamic ensemble mechanism.
  The proposed framework enables the estimation of calibrated conditional quantiles at arbitrary probability levels within a single trained model and effectively exploits spatial dependencies to enhance robustness at the system level. The approach is evaluated using 30 years of hourly PV generation data from 259 European regions and compared against established statistical and neural probabilistic baselines. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in forecast accuracy, calibration, and prediction interval quality, underscoring the suitability of the proposed method for uncertainty-aware energy management and operational decision-making in renewable-dominated power systems.

*Ling Zhan,Zhen Li,Junjie Huang,Tao Jia*

TL;DR: SCLCS is a self-supervised framework that selects small, representative core-sets to preserve functional connectivity model rankings, enabling efficient benchmarking with only 10% of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarking hundreds of functional connectivity modeling methods on large-scale fMRI datasets is computationally prohibitive due to combinatorial explosion of model-data pairings, preventing routine assessments.

Method: SCLCS uses adaptive Transformer to learn each sample's FC structure, introduces Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) to quantify structure stability, and applies density-balanced sampling for diversity.

Result: On REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves ground-truth model ranking with just 10% of data, outperforming SOTA core-set methods by up to 23.2% in ranking consistency (nDCG@k).

Conclusion: This is the first work to formalize core-set selection for FC operator benchmarking, making large-scale operator comparisons feasible for computational neuroscience.

Abstract: Benchmarking the hundreds of functional connectivity (FC) modeling methods on large-scale fMRI datasets is critical for reproducible neuroscience. However, the combinatorial explosion of model-data pairings makes exhaustive evaluation computationally prohibitive, preventing such assessments from becoming a routine pre-analysis step. To break this bottleneck, we reframe the challenge of FC benchmarking by selecting a small, representative core-set whose sole purpose is to preserve the relative performance ranking of FC operators. We formalize this as a ranking-preserving subset selection problem and propose Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Core-set Selection (SCLCS), a self-supervised framework to select these core-sets. SCLCS first uses an adaptive Transformer to learn each sample's unique FC structure. It then introduces a novel Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) to quantify the stability of these learned structures during training, identifying samples that represent foundational connectivity archetypes. Finally, while SCLCS identifies stable samples via a top-k ranking, we further introduce a density-balanced sampling strategy as a necessary correction to promote diversity, ensuring the final core-set is both structurally robust and distributionally representative. On the large-scale REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves the ground-truth model ranking with just 10% of the data, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) core-set selection methods by up to 23.2% in ranking consistency (nDCG@k). To our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize core-set selection for FC operator benchmarking, thereby making large-scale operators comparisons a feasible and integral part of computational neuroscience.

### [279] [Stable but Wrong: When More Data Degrades Scientific Conclusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05668)
*Zhipeng Zhang,Kai Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Standard inference procedures can systematically converge to wrong conclusions despite appearing well-calibrated, when observation reliability degrades in unobservable ways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the implicit belief that accumulating more data always makes scientific conclusions more reliable, and to reveal fundamental limits of data-driven science.

Method: Identifies a structural regime where inference fails despite apparent correctness, and uses minimal synthetic experiments to demonstrate systematic convergence to incorrect conclusions.

Result: In the identified regime, additional data amplify rather than correct errors, while diagnostic checks remain misleadingly normal. Stability, convergence, and confidence are insufficient indicators of epistemic validity.

Conclusion: Inference cannot be treated as an unconditional consequence of data availability; it must be governed by explicit constraints on observational process integrity.

Abstract: Modern science increasingly relies on ever-growing observational datasets and automated inference pipelines, under the implicit belief that accumulating more data makes scientific conclusions more reliable. Here we show that this belief can fail in a fundamental and irreversible way. We identify a structural regime in which standard inference procedures converge smoothly, remain well calibrated, and pass conventional diagnostic checks, yet systematically converge to incorrect conclusions. This failure arises when the reliability of observations degrades in a manner that is intrinsically unobservable to the inference process itself. Using minimal synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that in this regime additional data do not correct error but instead amplify it, while residual-based and goodness-of-fit diagnostics remain misleadingly normal. These results reveal an intrinsic limit of data-driven science: stability, convergence, and confidence are not sufficient indicators of epistemic validity. We argue that inference cannot be treated as an unconditional consequence of data availability, but must instead be governed by explicit constraints on the integrity of the observational process.

*Miriam Schäfers,Merlijn Krale,Thiago D. Simão,Nils Jansen,Maximilian Weininger*

TL;DR: PBP framework integrates perception models (image classifiers) with traditional POMDP solvers to handle high-dimensional visual observations, outperforming deep RL methods and improving robustness through uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional POMDP solvers struggle with real-world problems involving high-dimensional observations like camera images, making them intractable for belief- and filtering-based approaches.

Method: Introduces Perception-based Beliefs for POMDPs (PBP) framework that uses an image classifier to map visual observations to state probability distributions, incorporating these directly into belief updates without requiring solvers to reason over high-dimensional observation spaces.

Result: PBP outperforms existing end-to-end deep RL methods, and uncertainty quantification improves robustness against visual corruption. The belief update coincides with standard belief update when the classifier is exact.

Conclusion: PBP successfully bridges perception and planning by integrating perception models with traditional POMDP solvers, enabling effective handling of high-dimensional visual observations while maintaining theoretical guarantees and improving practical performance.

Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a principled planning model for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Yet, real-world problems with high-dimensional observations, such as camera images, remain intractable for traditional belief- and filtering-based solvers. To tackle this problem, we introduce the Perception-based Beliefs for POMDPs framework (PBP), which complements such solvers with a perception model. This model takes the form of an image classifier which maps visual observations to probability distributions over states. PBP incorporates these distributions directly into belief updates, so the underlying solver does not need to reason explicitly over high-dimensional observation spaces. We show that the belief update of PBP coincides with the standard belief update if the image classifier is exact. Moreover, to handle classifier imprecision, we incorporate uncertainty quantification and introduce two methods to adjust the belief update accordingly. We implement PBP using two traditional POMDP solvers and empirically show that (1) it outperforms existing end-to-end deep RL methods and (2) uncertainty quantification improves robustness of PBP against visual corruption.

TL;DR: AlphaEvolve uses frontier LLMs as mutators to evolve activation functions from all possible Python functions within FLOP constraints, enabling discovery of functions with specific inductive biases through OOD performance as fitness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Activation functions significantly impact optimization and inductive bias, but manual search spaces limit discovery. Evolutionary search with modern LLM-based pipelines can explore wider spaces and target specific biases.

Method: AlphaEvolve framework using frontier LLMs as mutation operators to search over all possible Python functions within FLOP budgets, using out-of-distribution performance as fitness function to encode specific inductive biases.

Result: Relatively small-scale synthetic datasets are sufficient for AlphaEvolve to discover meaningful activation functions, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-guided evolutionary search.

Conclusion: Evolutionary search with LLM mutators enables flexible discovery of activation functions targeting specific inductive biases, moving beyond performance optimization to architectural bias control.

Abstract: The choice of activation function is an active area of research, with different proposals aimed at improving optimization, while maintaining expressivity. Additionally, the activation function can significantly alter the implicit inductive bias of the architecture, controlling its non-linear behavior. In this paper, in line with previous work, we argue that evolutionary search provides a useful framework for finding new activation functions, while we also make two novel observations. The first is that modern pipelines, such as AlphaEvolve, which relies on frontier LLMs as a mutator operator, allows for a much wider and flexible search space; e.g., over all possible python functions within a certain FLOP budget, eliminating the need for manually constructed search spaces. In addition, these pipelines will be biased towards meaningful activation functions, given their ability to represent common knowledge, leading to a potentially more efficient search of the space. The second observation is that, through this framework, one can target not only performance improvements but also activation functions that encode particular inductive biases. This can be done by using performance on out-of-distribution data as a fitness function, reflecting the degree to which the architecture respects the inherent structure in the data in a manner independent of distribution shifts. We carry an empirical exploration of this proposal and show that relatively small scale synthetic datasets can be sufficient for AlphaEvolve to discover meaningful activations.

TL;DR: FedRandom is a novel technique that mitigates contribution instability in Federated Learning by treating it as a statistical estimation problem, generating more samples than regular FL strategies to provide more consistent and reliable participant contribution assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In industrial FL deployments, fairly assessing individual contributions is crucial for participant compensation, identifying malicious actors/free-riders, and maintaining willingness to participate. Recent works show inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies, which can harm participant engagement.

Method: FedRandom treats contribution instability as a statistical estimation problem and generates more samples than regular FL strategies. This approach allows for more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions.

Result: FedRandom reduces overall distance to ground truth by more than a third in half of evaluated scenarios and improves stability in more than 90% of cases across different data distributions on CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100, and FMNIST datasets.

Conclusion: FedRandom effectively addresses the contribution instability problem in Federated Learning by providing more reliable contribution assessments, which is essential for fair compensation, security, and maintaining participant engagement in industrial FL deployments.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a privacy-preserving decentralized approach for Machine Learning tasks. In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies. We show that these additional samples provide a more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions. We demonstrate our approach using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST and show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios, and improves stability in more than 90% of cases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a new non-Statistical Query framework to study limitations of vanilla SGD for single-index and multi-index models, addressing shortcomings of existing SQ approaches that don't reflect standard SGD noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Statistical Query (SQ) framework has tenuous connection to SGD - it relies on adversarial/specially-structured gradient noise that doesn't reflect standard SGD noise, and can lead to incorrect predictions. Many SGD analyses require non-trivial algorithmic modifications (restricting to sphere, small learning rates). Need a better framework to study vanilla SGD limitations.

Method: Develops a new non-SQ framework to study limitations of standard vanilla SGD for single-index and multi-index models (where target function depends on low-dimensional projection of inputs). Applies to broad class of settings and architectures including potentially deep neural networks.

Result: Not specified in abstract - paper presents a new analytical framework but doesn't state specific results in the abstract.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel framework to better understand the limitations of vanilla SGD for structured learning problems, addressing the disconnect between existing SQ analysis and practical SGD behavior.

Abstract: Understanding the limitations of gradient methods, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in particular, is a central challenge in learning theory. To that end, a commonly used tool is the Statistical Queries (SQ) framework, which studies performance limits of algorithms based on noisy interaction with the data. However, it is known that the formal connection between the SQ framework and SGD is tenuous: Existing results typically rely on adversarial or specially-structured gradient noise that does not reflect the noise in standard SGD, and (as we point out here) can sometimes lead to incorrect predictions. Moreover, many analyses of SGD for challenging problems rely on non-trivial algorithmic modifications, such as restricting the SGD trajectory to the sphere or using very small learning rates. To address these shortcomings, we develop a new, non-SQ framework to study the limitations of standard vanilla SGD, for single-index and multi-index models (namely, when the target function depends on a low-dimensional projection of the inputs). Our results apply to a broad class of settings and architectures, including (potentially deep) neural networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that apparent fairness-accuracy tradeoffs can be artifacts of misrepresented subgroup proportions in training data, and proposes an evaluation protocol with optimal shrinkage reweighting to reveal the true fairness-utility frontier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners often observe tension between predictive accuracy and group fairness constraints, but sometimes fairness interventions appear to improve accuracy. The authors aim to explain these contradictory phenomena and provide a proper evaluation framework.

Method: The authors analyze subpopulation shift scenarios (stable within-group distributions but shifted group proportions) and establish theoretical results about importance-weighted correction. They propose an actionable evaluation protocol that fixes representation optimally before fairness, using shrinkage reweighting that interpolates between target and training mixtures.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows: (i) full importance-weighted correction is asymptotically unbiased but finite-sample suboptimal; (ii) optimal finite-sample correction is shrinkage reweighting; (iii) apparent "fairness helps accuracy" can arise from comparing to improperly-weighted baselines. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks (Adult, COMPAS) validate predictions.

Conclusion: The proposed evaluation protocol (fix representation optimally before fairness, compare fairness interventions against shrinkage-corrected baseline) eliminates spurious tradeoffs and reveals the genuine fairness-utility frontier, providing a more accurate assessment of fairness interventions.

Abstract: Machine learning practitioners frequently observe tension between predictive accuracy and group fairness constraints -- yet sometimes fairness interventions appear to improve accuracy. We show that both phenomena can be artifacts of training data that misrepresents subgroup proportions. Under subpopulation shift (stable within-group distributions, shifted group proportions), we establish: (i) full importance-weighted correction is asymptotically unbiased but finite-sample suboptimal; (ii) the optimal finite-sample correction is a shrinkage reweighting that interpolates between target and training mixtures; (iii) apparent "fairness helps accuracy" can arise from comparing fairness methods to an improperly-weighted baseline. We provide an actionable evaluation protocol: fix representation (optimally) before fairness -- compare fairness interventions against a shrinkage-corrected baseline to isolate the true, irreducible price of fairness. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks (Adult, COMPAS) validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that this protocol eliminates spurious tradeoffs, revealing the genuine fairness-utility frontier.

TL;DR: FairBoost incorporates group fairness constraints into AdaBoost by projecting exponential-weights distributions onto fairness-satisfying distributions, theoretically quantifying the accuracy-fairness tradeoff through reduced weak learner edge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While boosting algorithms like AdaBoost have strong theoretical guarantees for accuracy, there's a need to incorporate group fairness constraints while preserving analyzable training dynamics and understanding the accuracy-fairness tradeoff.

Method: FairBoost projects the ensemble-induced exponential-weights distribution onto a convex set of distributions satisfying fairness constraints (as a reweighting surrogate), then trains weak learners on this fair distribution. The projection reduces weak learner edge by a quantity controlled by KL-divergence.

Result: Theoretical proof shows exponential-loss bound where convergence rate depends on weak learner edge minus a "fairness cost" term δ_t = √(KL(w^t || q^t)/2), directly quantifying accuracy-fairness tradeoff. Experiments validate predictions and show competitive fairness-accuracy tradeoffs with stable training.

Conclusion: FairBoost successfully incorporates group fairness into boosting while maintaining analyzable training dynamics, providing theoretical quantification of the accuracy-fairness tradeoff through projection-induced edge reduction, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: Boosting algorithms enjoy strong theoretical guarantees: when weak learners maintain positive edge, AdaBoost achieves geometric decrease of exponential loss. We study how to incorporate group fairness constraints into boosting while preserving analyzable training dynamics. Our approach, FairBoost, projects the ensemble-induced exponential-weights distribution onto a convex set of distributions satisfying fairness constraints (as a reweighting surrogate), then trains weak learners on this fair distribution. The key theoretical insight is that projecting the training distribution reduces the effective edge of weak learners by a quantity controlled by the KL-divergence of the projection. We prove an exponential-loss bound where the convergence rate depends on weak learner edge minus a "fairness cost" term $δ_t = \sqrt{\mathrm{KL}(w^t \| q^t)/2}$. This directly quantifies the accuracy-fairness tradeoff in boosting dynamics. Experiments on standard benchmarks validate the theoretical predictions and demonstrate competitive fairness-accuracy tradeoffs with stable training curves.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Surjective Pseudo-invertible Neural Networks (SPNN) as a nonlinear generalization of the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse, enabling tractable nonlinear pseudo-inverses for neural networks with geometric properties like back-projection, which extends zero-shot inverse problem solving to nonlinear degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse provides fundamental solutions for linear systems but doesn't extend to nonlinear regimes. There's a need to generalize pseudo-inverse concepts to nonlinear mappings, particularly for neural networks, to enable consistent back-projection and solve nonlinear inverse problems in a zero-shot manner without retraining diffusion models.

Method: Proposes Surjective Pseudo-invertible Neural Networks (SPNN) - architectures explicitly designed to admit tractable nonlinear pseudo-inverses. Formalizes Non-Linear Back-Projection (NLBP) that guarantees consistency constraints for nonlinear mappings via the defined pseudo-inverse. Extends diffusion-based null-space projection to nonlinear degradations.

Result: SPNNs satisfy fundamental geometric properties including null-space projection/back-projection. The approach enables zero-shot inversion of complex nonlinear degradations (from optical distortions to semantic abstractions) and allows precise semantic control over generative outputs without retraining diffusion priors.

Conclusion: The proposed nonlinear pseudo-inverse and SPNN architecture successfully generalize pseudo-inverse concepts to nonlinear regimes, expanding the scope of zero-shot inverse problem solving to include nonlinear degradations while maintaining geometric consistency properties.

Abstract: The Moore-Penrose Pseudo-inverse (PInv) serves as the fundamental solution for linear systems. In this paper, we propose a natural generalization of PInv to the nonlinear regime in general and to neural networks in particular. We introduce Surjective Pseudo-invertible Neural Networks (SPNN), a class of architectures explicitly designed to admit a tractable non-linear PInv. The proposed non-linear PInv and its implementation in SPNN satisfy fundamental geometric properties. One such property is null-space projection or "Back-Projection", $x' = x + A^\dagger(y-Ax)$, which moves a sample $x$ to its closest consistent state $x'$ satisfying $Ax=y$. We formalize Non-Linear Back-Projection (NLBP), a method that guarantees the same consistency constraint for non-linear mappings $f(x)=y$ via our defined PInv. We leverage SPNNs to expand the scope of zero-shot inverse problems. Diffusion-based null-space projection has revolutionized zero-shot solving for linear inverse problems by exploiting closed-form back-projection. We extend this method to non-linear degradations. Here, "degradation" is broadly generalized to include any non-linear loss of information, spanning from optical distortions to semantic abstractions like classification. This approach enables zero-shot inversion of complex degradations and allows precise semantic control over generative outputs without retraining the diffusion prior.

*Binghui Li,Kaifei Wang,Han Zhong,Pinyan Lu,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Muon optimizer shows exponential speedup over GD in associative memory models by mitigating imbalanced learning rates across frequency components, with theoretical scaling laws and practical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon optimizer has shown strong empirical performance but lacks theoretical understanding of its dynamics and scaling behavior, particularly in comparison to Gradient Descent.

Method: Analyze Muon in a linear associative memory model with softmax retrieval and hierarchical frequency spectrum, studying both noiseless and noisy cases with label noise, and interpret Muon as an implicit matrix preconditioner.

Result: Muon achieves exponential speedup over GD in noiseless case, superior scaling efficiency in noisy case with power-decay spectrum, and can be interpreted as an adaptive task-aligned preconditioner that SignGD cannot match without oracle access.

Conclusion: Muon's theoretical advantages over GD are validated through synthetic classification and LLaMA-style pre-training experiments, providing both theoretical understanding and practical significance.

Abstract: Muon updates matrix parameters via the matrix sign of the gradient and has shown strong empirical gains, yet its dynamics and scaling behavior remain unclear in theory. We study Muon in a linear associative memory model with softmax retrieval and a hierarchical frequency spectrum over query-answer pairs, with and without label noise. In this setting, we show that Gradient Descent (GD) learns frequency components at highly imbalanced rates, leading to slow convergence bottlenecked by low-frequency components. In contrast, the Muon optimizer mitigates this imbalance, leading to faster and more uniform progress. Specifically, in the noiseless case, Muon achieves an exponential speedup over GD; in the noisy case with a power-decay frequency spectrum, we derive Muon's optimization scaling law and demonstrate its superior scaling efficiency over GD. Furthermore, we show that Muon can be interpreted as an implicit matrix preconditioner arising from adaptive task alignment and block-symmetric gradient structure. In contrast, the preconditioner with coordinate-wise sign operator could match Muon under oracle access to unknown task representations, which is infeasible for SignGD in practice. Experiments on synthetic long-tail classification and LLaMA-style pre-training corroborate the theory.

*Prakhar Kaushik,Ankit Vaidya,Shravan Chaudhari,Rama Chellappa,Alan Yuille*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Share is a parameter-efficient continual fine-tuning method that learns a single shared low-rank subspace for lifelong learning across tasks and modalities, achieving massive parameter and memory savings while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large pretrained models need efficient continual adaptation to new tasks without catastrophic forgetting or high retraining costs. Existing methods like LoRA lack proper continual learning mechanisms and require multiple adapters or data replay.

Method: Share constructs a foundational low-rank subspace that extracts core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally updates it for new tasks by identifying essential subspace directions, enabling forward knowledge transfer while minimizing interference.

Result: Achieves up to 100x parameter reduction and 281x memory savings over traditional LoRA methods, with performance comparable to jointly trained models. A single Share model can replace hundreds of task-specific LoRA adapters.

Conclusion: Share provides a practical and scalable solution for lifelong learning in large-scale AI systems, validated across diverse tasks including image classification, NLP, 3D pose estimation, and text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Adapting large pretrained models to new tasks efficiently and continually is crucial for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to catastrophic forgetting and the high cost of retraining. While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands, they lack mechanisms for strict continual learning and knowledge integration, without relying on data replay, or multiple adapters. We propose Share, a novel approach to parameter efficient continual finetuning that learns and dynamically updates a single, shared low-rank subspace, enabling seamless adaptation across multiple tasks and modalities. Share constructs a foundational subspace that extracts core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally integrates new information by identifying essential subspace directions. Knowledge from each new task is incorporated into this evolving subspace, facilitating forward knowledge transfer, while minimizing catastrophic interference. This approach achieves up to 100x parameter reduction and 281x memory savings over traditional LoRA methods, maintaining performance comparable to jointly trained models. A single Share model can replace hundreds of task-specific LoRA adapters, supporting scalable, asynchronous continual learning. Experiments across image classification, natural language understanding, 3D pose estimation, and text-to-image generation validate its effectiveness, making Share a practical and scalable solution for lifelong learning in large-scale AI systems.

*Xin Chen,Jie Zhang,Florian Tramer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoInject: RL framework for automated prompt injection attacks that generates universal adversarial suffixes, compromising major LLMs like GPT-5 Nano, Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Gemini 2.5 Flash.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt injection is a critical LLM vulnerability, but current methods rely heavily on human red-teamers and hand-crafted prompts, limiting scalability and adaptability. There's a need for automated, optimization-based approaches to generate effective adversarial attacks.

Method: AutoInject uses reinforcement learning to generate universal, transferable adversarial suffixes. It jointly optimizes for attack success on target tasks while preserving utility on benign tasks. The black-box method supports both query-based optimization and transfer attacks to unseen models/tasks, using only a 1.5B parameter adversarial suffix generator.

Result: Successfully compromised frontier LLM systems including GPT-5 Nano, Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Gemini 2.5 Flash on the AgentDojo benchmark. Established a stronger baseline for automated prompt injection research.

Conclusion: AutoInject demonstrates that automated optimization approaches can effectively generate universal adversarial suffixes for prompt injection attacks, overcoming limitations of manual methods and providing a scalable framework for vulnerability assessment.

Abstract: Prompt injection is one of the most critical vulnerabilities in LLM agents; yet, effective automated attacks remain largely unexplored from an optimization perspective. Existing methods heavily depend on human red-teamers and hand-crafted prompts, limiting their scalability and adaptability. We propose AutoInject, a reinforcement learning framework that generates universal, transferable adversarial suffixes while jointly optimizing for attack success and utility preservation on benign tasks. Our black-box method supports both query-based optimization and transfer attacks to unseen models and tasks. Using only a 1.5B parameter adversarial suffix generator, we successfully compromise frontier systems including GPT 5 Nano, Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Gemini 2.5 Flash on the AgentDojo benchmark, establishing a stronger baseline for automated prompt injection research.

### [290] [How to Achieve the Intended Aim of Deep Clustering Now, without Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05749)
*Kai Ming Ting,Wei-Jie Xu,Hang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEC's deep-learned representation doesn't overcome k-means limitations; a non-deep approach using cluster distributional information achieves deep clustering's intended aims better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether deep clustering methods like DEC actually overcome the fundamental limitations of k-means clustering (inability to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, varied sizes and densities), and to examine if deep clustering's advantages are genuine or just demonstrated on limited image datasets.

Method: Analyzes Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) which uses autoencoder for latent representation and k-means-like clustering in end-to-end optimization. Compares with a non-deep learning approach that exploits underlying data distribution and cluster distributional information.

Result: DEC's deep-learned representation fails to overcome k-means' fundamental limitations. A non-deep approach using distributional information of clusters effectively addresses these limitations and achieves deep clustering's intended aims.

Conclusion: Deep clustering methods like DEC don't actually solve k-means' core limitations. The key insight is that exploiting underlying data distribution and cluster distributional information (which deep methods don't do) is what's needed to overcome these limitations.

Abstract: Deep clustering (DC) is often quoted to have a key advantage over $k$-means clustering. Yet, this advantage is often demonstrated using image datasets only, and it is unclear whether it addresses the fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering. Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) learns a latent representation via an autoencoder and performs clustering based on a $k$-means-like procedure, while the optimization is conducted in an end-to-end manner. This paper investigates whether the deep-learned representation has enabled DEC to overcome the known fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering, i.e., its inability to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, varied sizes and densities. Our investigations on DEC have a wider implication on deep clustering methods in general. Notably, none of these methods exploit the underlying data distribution. We uncover that a non-deep learning approach achieves the intended aim of deep clustering by making use of distributional information of clusters in a dataset to effectively address these fundamental limitations.

### [291] [Variational Speculative Decoding: Rethinking Draft Training from Token Likelihood to Sequence Acceptance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05774)
*Xiandong Zou,Jianshu Li,Jing Huang,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VSD proposes variational inference for draft training in speculative decoding, optimizing multiple draft paths rather than single greedy trajectories to improve decoding efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding methods have a training-decoding discrepancy: they optimize single greedy trajectories during training, but actual decoding involves verifying and ranking multiple sampled draft paths.

Method: Formulates draft training as variational inference over latent proposals (draft paths), maximizing target-model acceptance probability. Uses EM procedure with MCMC sampling from oracle-filtered posterior (E-step) and weighted likelihood maximization with Adaptive Rejection Weighting and Confidence-Aware Regularization (M-step).

Result: VSD achieves up to 9.6% speedup over EAGLE-3 and 7.9% over ViSpec across LLMs and MLLMs, significantly improving decoding efficiency with theoretical guarantees of increased expected acceptance length and speedup.

Conclusion: Variational Speculative Decoding effectively addresses the training-decoding discrepancy in speculative decoding by optimizing multiple draft paths through variational inference, leading to substantial improvements in decoding efficiency.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates inference for (M)LLMs, yet a training-decoding discrepancy persists: while existing methods optimize single greedy trajectories, decoding involves verifying and ranking multiple sampled draft paths. We propose Variational Speculative Decoding (VSD), formulating draft training as variational inference over latent proposals (draft paths). VSD maximizes the marginal probability of target-model acceptance, yielding an ELBO that promotes high-quality latent proposals while minimizing divergence from the target distribution. To enhance quality and reduce variance, we incorporate a path-level utility and optimize via an Expectation-Maximization procedure. The E-step draws MCMC samples from an oracle-filtered posterior, while the M-step maximizes weighted likelihood using Adaptive Rejection Weighting (ARW) and Confidence-Aware Regularization (CAR). Theoretical analysis confirms that VSD increases expected acceptance length and speedup. Extensive experiments across LLMs and MLLMs show that VSD achieves up to a 9.6% speedup over EAGLE-3 and 7.9% over ViSpec, significantly improving decoding efficiency.

### [292] [Cross-Domain Offline Policy Adaptation via Selective Transition Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05776)
*Mengbei Yan,Jiafei Lyu,Shengjie Sun,Zhongjian Qiao,Jingwen Yang,Zichuan Lin,Deheng Ye,Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STC algorithm corrects source domain transitions to match target domain dynamics using inverse policy and reward models, then filters them with forward dynamics model for better cross-domain offline RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain offline RL faces challenges when source and target domains have mismatched dynamics. Direct dataset merging leads to suboptimal performance, while existing filtering or reward modification approaches insufficiently exploit valuable source domain data.

Method: Proposes Selective Transition Correction (STC) algorithm that: 1) Uses inverse policy model and reward model to correct actions and rewards of source transitions to align with target dynamics, 2) Employs forward dynamics model to retain corrected samples that better match target dynamics than original transitions.

Result: Experiments on various environments with dynamics shifts demonstrate that STC achieves superior performance against existing baselines.

Conclusion: STC enables reliable usage of source domain data for policy adaptation in cross-domain offline RL by explicitly modifying source data to match target dynamics rather than filtering or modifying rewards.

Abstract: It remains a critical challenge to adapt policies across domains with mismatched dynamics in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we study cross-domain offline RL, where an offline dataset from another similar source domain can be accessed to enhance policy learning upon a target domain dataset. Directly merging the two datasets may lead to suboptimal performance due to potential dynamics mismatches. Existing approaches typically mitigate this issue through source domain transition filtering or reward modification, which, however, may lead to insufficient exploitation of the valuable source domain data. Instead, we propose to modify the source domain data into the target domain data. To that end, we leverage an inverse policy model and a reward model to correct the actions and rewards of source transitions, explicitly achieving alignment with the target dynamics. Since limited data may result in inaccurate model training, we further employ a forward dynamics model to retain corrected samples that better match the target dynamics than the original transitions. Consequently, we propose the Selective Transition Correction (STC) algorithm, which enables reliable usage of source domain data for policy adaptation. Experiments on various environments with dynamics shifts demonstrate that STC achieves superior performance against existing baselines.

### [293] [Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Diffusion Bridge Critics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05783)
*Shutong Ding,Yimiao Zhou,Ke Hu,Mokai Pan,Shan Zhong,Yanwei Fu,Jingya Wang,Ye Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DBC is a novel distributional RL method using Diffusion Bridge Critics to model Q-value distributions, outperforming previous distributional critic models on MuJoCo benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based RL methods focus on diffusion policies but neglect diffusion critics. Since policy optimization fundamentally relies on accurate value estimation (more important than policy expressiveness), and critics should be distributional due to RL task stochasticity, there's a need for better distributional critic models.

Method: Proposes Diffusion Bridge Critics (DBC) that directly models the inverse CDF of Q values using diffusion bridge models. This captures value distributions accurately without collapsing to trivial Gaussian distributions. Also derives an analytic integral formula to address discretization errors in value estimation.

Result: Experimental results on MuJoCo robot control benchmarks demonstrate DBC's superiority over previous distributional critic models. DBC is plug-and-play and can be integrated into most existing RL frameworks.

Conclusion: DBC is the first work to employ diffusion bridge models as critics, providing accurate distributional value estimation that outperforms existing approaches while being compatible with various RL frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated promising results in a wide range of continuous control tasks. However, existing works in this field focus on the application of diffusion policies while leaving the diffusion critics unexplored. In fact, since policy optimization fundamentally relies on the critic, accurate value estimation is far more important than policy expressiveness. Furthermore, given the stochasticity of most reinforcement learning tasks, it has been confirmed that the critic is more appropriately depicted with a distributional model. Motivated by these points, we propose a novel distributional RL method with Diffusion Bridge Critics (DBC). DBC directly models the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Q value. This allows us to accurately capture the value distribution and prevents it from collapsing into a trivial Gaussian distribution owing to the strong distribution-matching capability of the diffusion bridge. Moreover, we further derive an analytic integral formula to address discretization errors in DBC, which is essential in value estimation. To our knowledge, DBC is the first work to employ the diffusion bridge model as the critic. Notably, DBC is also a plug-and-play component and can be integrated into most existing RL frameworks. Experimental results on MuJoCo robot control benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DBC compared with previous distributional critic models.

*Floris Jan Koster,Fabio Sigrist*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SMAC method outperforms other hyperparameter optimization techniques for tree-boosting, requiring 100+ trials for accurate tuning, with all hyperparameters being important and early stopping being beneficial for regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree-boosting's out-of-sample accuracy critically depends on hyperparameters, but there's limited empirical comparison of popular hyperparameter optimization methods across diverse datasets.

Method: Empirical comparison of 7 hyperparameter optimization methods (random grid search, TPE, GP-BO, Hyperband, SMAC, deterministic grid search) using 59 regression and classification datasets for tree-boosting.

Result: SMAC method clearly outperforms all other methods. Key findings: need 100+ trials for accurate tuning, default values yield inaccurate models, all hyperparameters matter equally, early stopping improves regression accuracy.

Conclusion: SMAC is the recommended hyperparameter optimization method for tree-boosting, requiring substantial computational budget (100+ trials) and careful consideration of all hyperparameters, with early stopping preferred for regression tasks.

Abstract: Tree-boosting is a widely used machine learning technique for tabular data. However, its out-of-sample accuracy is critically dependent on multiple hyperparameters. In this article, we empirically compare several popular methods for hyperparameter optimization for tree-boosting including random grid search, the tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE), Gaussian-process-based Bayesian optimization (GP-BO), Hyperband, the sequential model-based algorithm configuration (SMAC) method, and deterministic full grid search using $59$ regression and classification data sets. We find that the SMAC method clearly outperforms all the other considered methods. We further observe that (i) a relatively large number of trials larger than $100$ is required for accurate tuning, (ii) using default values for hyperparameters yields very inaccurate models, (iii) all considered hyperparameters can have a material effect on the accuracy of tree-boosting, i.e., there is no small set of hyperparameters that is more important than others, and (iv) choosing the number of boosting iterations using early stopping yields more accurate results compared to including it in the search space for regression tasks.

### [295] [Classification Under Local Differential Privacy with Model Reversal and Model Averaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05797)
*Caihong Qin,Yang Bai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes novel transfer learning techniques to improve classification performance under Local Differential Privacy (LDP) by treating noisy LDP data as source domain and clean data as target domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local Differential Privacy (LDP) provides strong privacy guarantees by perturbing user data at the source, but the introduced noise significantly reduces data utility, creating a need for methods that improve classification performance without compromising privacy.

Method: The authors reinterpret private learning under LDP as a transfer learning problem and propose three novel techniques: (1) noised binary feedback-based evaluation for estimating dataset utility, (2) model reversal to salvage underperforming classifiers by inverting decision boundaries, and (3) model averaging that assigns weights to multiple reversed classifiers based on estimated utility.

Result: The paper provides theoretical excess risk bounds under LDP and demonstrates how the proposed methods reduce this risk. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets show substantial improvements in classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed transfer learning framework and novel techniques effectively address the utility-privacy trade-off in LDP by significantly improving classification performance while maintaining strong privacy guarantees, offering a promising approach for practical LDP applications.

Abstract: Local differential privacy (LDP) has become a central topic in data privacy research, offering strong privacy guarantees by perturbing user data at the source and removing the need for a trusted curator. However, the noise introduced by LDP often significantly reduces data utility. To address this issue, we reinterpret private learning under LDP as a transfer learning problem, where the noisy data serve as the source domain and the unobserved clean data as the target. We propose novel techniques specifically designed for LDP to improve classification performance without compromising privacy: (1) a noised binary feedback-based evaluation mechanism for estimating dataset utility; (2) model reversal, which salvages underperforming classifiers by inverting their decision boundaries; and (3) model averaging, which assigns weights to multiple reversed classifiers based on their estimated utility. We provide theoretical excess risk bounds under LDP and demonstrate how our methods reduce this risk. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets show substantial improvements in classification accuracy.

### [296] [Bifrost: Steering Strategic Trajectories to Bridge Contextual Gaps for Self-Improving Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05810)
*Quan M. Tran,Zhuo Huang,Wenbin Zhang,Bo Han,Koji Yatani,Masashi Sugiyama,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bifrost is a training-free method that bridges context gaps by adapting past successful trajectories to new tasks using context differences and agent hidden states, outperforming existing trajectory reuse methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for autonomous agent self-improvement struggle with context mismatch when shifting across tasks - they either discard successful trajectories or use heuristic manipulations, leading to high fine-tuning costs or unreliable performance.

Method: Bifrost leverages the discovered context-trajectory correlation to guide adaptation of previously solved trajectories using context differences. It performs trajectory adaptation at the representation level using agent hidden states to ensure accurate alignment with target contexts in a shared space.

Result: Across diverse benchmarks, Bifrost consistently outperforms existing trajectory reuse and finetuned self-improvement methods, demonstrating effective leveraging of past experiences despite substantial context shifts.

Conclusion: Agents can effectively reuse past experiences across different tasks by bridging contextual gaps through representation-level trajectory adaptation, enabling training-free self-improvement without the costs of fine-tuning.

Abstract: Autonomous agents excel in self-improvement through reflection and iterative refinement, which reuse successful task trajectories as in-context examples to assist subsequent reasoning. However, shifting across tasks often introduces a context mismatch. Hence, existing approaches either discard the trajectories or manipulate them using heuristics, leading to a non-negligible fine-tuning cost or unguaranteed performance. To bridge this gap, we reveal a context-trajectory correlation, where shifts of context are highly parallel with shifts of trajectory. Based on this finding, we propose BrIdge contextual gap FoR imprOvised trajectory STeering (Bifrost), a training-free method that leverages context differences to precisely guide the adaptation of previously solved trajectories towards the target task, mitigating the misalignment caused by context shifts. Our trajectory adaptation is conducted at the representation level using agent hidden states, ensuring trajectory transformation accurately aligns with the target context in a shared space. Across diverse benchmarks, Bifrost consistently outperforms existing trajectory reuse and finetuned self-improvement methods, demonstrating that agents can effectively leverage past experiences despite substantial context shifts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for confidence estimation in CT reconstruction with theoretical coverage guarantees, applicable to both classical and deep learning methods, showing deep methods produce tighter confidence regions without sacrificing coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for principled confidence estimation in CT reconstruction to provide uncertainty quantification, detect hallucinations in deep learning reconstructions, and establish deep models as reliable tools for uncertainty-aware medical imaging.

Method: Based on sequential likelihood mixing framework, establishes confidence regions with theoretical coverage guarantees for CT reconstruction using realistic forward model (Beer-Lambert law with Poisson noise), applicable to U-Nets, U-Net ensembles, and Diffusion models.

Result: Deep reconstruction methods yield substantially tighter confidence regions than classical reconstructions while maintaining theoretical coverage guarantees, enabling detection of hallucinations and providing interpretable visualizations of confidence regions.

Conclusion: The framework establishes deep models not only as powerful estimators but also as reliable tools for uncertainty-aware medical imaging with principled confidence estimation.

Abstract: We present a principled framework for confidence estimation in computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. Based on the sequential likelihood mixing framework (Kirschner et al., 2025), we establish confidence regions with theoretical coverage guarantees for deep-learning-based CT reconstructions. We consider a realistic forward model following the Beer-Lambert law, i.e., a log-linear forward model with Poisson noise, closely reflecting clinical and scientific imaging conditions. The framework is general and applies to both classical algorithms and deep learning reconstruction methods, including U-Nets, U-Net ensembles, and generative Diffusion models. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep reconstruction methods yield substantially tighter confidence regions than classical reconstructions, without sacrificing theoretical coverage guarantees. Our approach allows the detection of hallucinations in reconstructed images and provides interpretable visualizations of confidence regions. This establishes deep models not only as powerful estimators, but also as reliable tools for uncertainty-aware medical imaging.

*Artem Riabinin,Andrey Veprikov,Arman Bolatov,Martin Takáč,Aleksandr Beznosikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive learning rate scheduler for norm-constrained optimizers (like Muon and Lion) that automatically determines warm-up duration based on theoretical convergence guarantees, eliminating manual tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning rate scheduling for norm-constrained optimizers relies on heuristic warm-up and decay schedules that require manual tuning. The authors aim to develop a theoretically-grounded adaptive scheduler that automatically determines optimal warm-up duration without additional hyperparameter search.

Method: The authors first introduce a generalized smoothness assumption where local curvature decreases with suboptimality gap, which they empirically verify. Under this assumption, they establish convergence guarantees that naturally lead to warm-up followed by decay. Based on this theory, they develop a practical scheduler that adapts warm-up duration automatically using only standard hyperparameters.

Result: The adaptive scheduler was evaluated on large language model pretraining with LLaMA architectures. It consistently outperformed or matched the best manually tuned warm-up schedules across all setups, without requiring additional hyperparameter search.

Conclusion: The paper presents a theoretically-grounded adaptive learning rate scheduler for norm-constrained optimizers that automatically determines optimal warm-up duration, eliminating the need for manual tuning while maintaining or improving performance in large language model pretraining.

Abstract: We study adaptive learning rate scheduling for norm-constrained optimizers (e.g., Muon and Lion). We introduce a generalized smoothness assumption under which local curvature decreases with the suboptimality gap and empirically verify that this behavior holds along optimization trajectories. Under this assumption, we establish convergence guarantees under an appropriate choice of learning rate, for which warm-up followed by decay arises naturally from the proof rather than being imposed heuristically.
  Building on this theory, we develop a practical learning rate scheduler that relies only on standard hyperparameters and adapts the warm-up duration automatically at the beginning of training. We evaluate this method on large language model pretraining with LLaMA architectures and show that our adaptive warm-up selection consistently outperforms or at least matches the best manually tuned warm-up schedules across all considered setups, without additional hyperparameter search.

*Laura Plein,Alexi Turcotte,Arina Hallemans,Andreas Zeller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a privacy-preserving synthetic data generation method using fuzzing and discrimination instead of direct GAN training on original data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for synthetic datasets that replicate statistical distributions of original data without compromising confidentiality. Existing GAN-based approaches either lack accuracy or remain vulnerable to privacy attacks like membership inference and dataset reconstruction.

Method: Uses a test generator (fuzzer) to produce data from input specifications while preserving original data constraints. A discriminator model evaluates closeness to original data. Evolutionary approach evolves samples using discriminator feedback to generate privacy-preserving data with similar statistical distributions.

Result: Evaluated on four datasets used in state-of-the-art techniques. Approach shows potential for generating synthetic datasets with high utility while preserving privacy.

Conclusion: The fuzzing-based approach with discriminator guidance can generate privacy-preserving synthetic data that maintains statistical properties of original datasets, addressing limitations of traditional GAN methods.

Abstract: There is a need for synthetic training and test datasets that replicate statistical distributions of original datasets without compromising their confidentiality. A lot of research has been done in leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic data generation. However, the resulting models are either not accurate enough or are still vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIA) or dataset reconstruction attacks since the original data has been leveraged in the training process. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of producing a synthetic test dataset with the same statistical properties as the original one, with only indirectly leveraging the original data in the generation process. The approach is inspired by GANs, with a generation step and a discrimination step. However, in our approach, we use a test generator (a fuzzer) to produce test data from an input specification, preserving constraints set by the original data; a discriminator model determines how close we are to the original data. By evolving samples and determining "good samples" with the discriminator, we can generate privacy-preserving data that follows the same statistical distributions are the original dataset, leading to a similar utility as the original data. We evaluated our approach on four datasets that have been used to evaluate the state-of-the-art techniques. Our experiments highlight the potential of our approach towards generating synthetic datasets that have high utility while preserving privacy.

### [300] [Visualizing the loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05849)
*Conor Rowan,Finn Murphy-Blanchard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), comparing Deep Ritz and strong form losses, finding they share similar smooth, well-conditioned properties with traditional data-driven classification problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While loss landscape studies have been extensive for image classification, there's little work on visualizing loss landscapes in physics-informed machine learning where losses are defined by differential operators rather than regression to large datasets. The authors aim to bridge this gap and challenge intuitions about PINN loss complexity.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive review of loss landscape literature, survey existing physics-informed works, and empirically investigate loss landscapes using various visualization techniques. They specifically compare Deep Ritz and squared residual forms of physics loss functions.

Result: PINN loss landscapes share many properties with data-driven classification problems: they appear smooth, well-conditioned, and convex near solutions. Surprisingly, both Deep Ritz and strong form losses give rise to similar landscapes despite different formulations.

Conclusion: The work introduces loss landscape perspective to scientific machine learning, shows PINN losses are less complex than assumed, and demonstrates similar geometric properties between different physics loss formulations, challenging prevailing intuitions about PINN optimization difficulty.

Abstract: Training a neural network requires navigating a high-dimensional, non-convex loss surface to find parameters that minimize this loss. In many ways, it is surprising that optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent and ADAM can reliably locate minima which perform well on both the training and test data. To understand the success of training, a "loss landscape" community has emerged to study the geometry of the loss function and the dynamics of optimization, often using visualization techniques. However, these loss landscape studies have mostly been limited to machine learning for image classification. In the newer field of physics-informed machine learning, little work has been conducted to visualize the landscapes of losses defined not by regression to large data sets, but by differential operators acting on state fields discretized by neural networks. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review of the loss landscape literature, as well as a discussion of the few existing physics-informed works which investigate the loss landscape. We then use a number of the techniques we survey to empirically investigate the landscapes defined by the Deep Ritz and squared residual forms of the physics loss function. We find that the loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks have many of the same properties as the data-driven classification problems studied in the literature. Unexpectedly, we find that the two formulations of the physics loss often give rise to similar landscapes, which appear smooth, well-conditioned, and convex in the vicinity of the solution. The purpose of this work is to introduce the loss landscape perspective to the scientific machine learning community, compare the Deep Ritz and the strong form losses, and to challenge prevailing intuitions about the complexity of the loss landscapes of physics-informed networks.

*Xu Wang,Bingqing Jiang,Yu Wan,Baosong Yang,Lingpeng Kong,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DLM-Scope: First SAE-based interpretability framework for diffusion language models, showing SAEs extract interpretable features and enable effective interventions, with unique behaviors compared to autoregressive LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as promising alternatives to autoregressive LLMs, but lack tailored mechanistic interpretability tools. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) work well for LLMs, so researchers want to develop similar interpretability frameworks for DLMs.

Method: Developed DLM-Scope, the first SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs. Trained Top-K SAEs to extract sparse, interpretable features from DLMs. Compared SAE insertion effects between DLMs and LLMs, and tested SAE-based interventions.

Result: SAEs can faithfully extract interpretable features from DLMs. SAE insertion in early DLM layers can reduce cross-entropy loss (unlike LLMs). SAE features enable more effective diffusion-time interventions than LLM steering. SAEs provide useful signals for DLM decoding order, and features remain stable during post-training.

Conclusion: DLM-Scope establishes a foundation for mechanistic interpretability in DLMs and demonstrates great potential for applying SAEs to DLM-related tasks and algorithms, opening new research directions for DLM interpretability.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a standard tool for mechanistic interpretability in autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling researchers to extract sparse, human-interpretable features and intervene on model behavior. Recently, as diffusion language models (DLMs) have become an increasingly promising alternative to the autoregressive LLMs, it is essential to develop tailored mechanistic interpretability tools for this emerging class of models. In this work, we present DLM-Scope, the first SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs, and demonstrate that trained Top-K SAEs can faithfully extract interpretable features. Notably, we find that inserting SAEs affects DLMs differently than autoregressive LLMs: while SAE insertion in LLMs typically incurs a loss penalty, in DLMs it can reduce cross-entropy loss when applied to early layers, a phenomenon absent or markedly weaker in LLMs. Additionally, SAE features in DLMs enable more effective diffusion-time interventions, often outperforming LLM steering. Moreover, we pioneer certain new SAE-based research directions for DLMs: we show that SAEs can provide useful signals for DLM decoding order; and the SAE features are stable during the post-training phase of DLMs. Our work establishes a foundation for mechanistic interpretability in DLMs and shows a great potential of applying SAEs to DLM-related tasks and algorithms.

TL;DR: CFRecs is a framework that transforms counterfactual graph explanations into actionable recommendations for real estate, using minimal structural changes to achieve desired outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While GNNs are effective for graph data and counterfactual explanations improve interpretability, there's a need to transform these explanations into actionable insights for practical applications like recommender systems.

Method: Two-stage architecture combining GNN and Graph-VAE to propose minimal yet high-impact changes in graph structure and node attributes, optimizing for sparsity of changes and validity of predictions.

Result: Experimental results on Zillow's user-listing interaction data demonstrate CFRecs' effectiveness in delivering actionable recommendations for home buyers and sellers.

Conclusion: CFRecs provides a novel perspective on recommendations using counterfactual reasoning in graphs, offering practical value for competitive markets like real estate.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous and powerful in representing complex relationships in many online platforms. While graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used to learn from such data, counterfactual graph learning has emerged as a promising approach to improve model interpretability. Counterfactual explanation research focuses on identifying a counterfactual graph that is similar to the original but leads to different predictions. These explanations optimize two objectives simultaneously: the sparsity of changes in the counterfactual graph and the validity of its predictions. Building on these qualitative optimization goals, this paper introduces CFRecs, a novel framework that transforms counterfactual explanations into actionable insights. CFRecs employs a two-stage architecture consisting of a graph neural network (GNN) and a graph variational auto-encoder (Graph-VAE) to strategically propose minimal yet high-impact changes in graph structure and node attributes to drive desirable outcomes in recommender systems. We apply CFRecs to Zillow's graph-structured data to deliver actionable recommendations for both home buyers and sellers with the goal of helping them navigate the competitive housing market and achieve their homeownership goals. Experimental results on Zillow's user-listing interaction data demonstrate the effectiveness of CFRecs, which also provides a fresh perspective on recommendations using counterfactual reasoning in graphs.

### [303] [Large-scale Score-based Variational Posterior Inference for Bayesian Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05873)
*Minyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel score-based variational inference method for Bayesian neural networks that combines score matching loss with proximal penalty, enabling scalability to large networks like Vision Transformers without reparametrized sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian neural networks offer advantages over point-estimate deep learning (uncertainty quantification, robustness, resistance to overfitting), but existing variational inference methods (especially ELBO-based) face scalability challenges for large networks. Score-based VI alternatives exist but are inadequate for large-scale BNNs due to computational and technical limitations.

Method: Proposes a scalable VI method combining score matching loss with proximal penalty term in iterations. Avoids reparametrized sampling and allows for noisy unbiased mini-batch scores through stochastic gradients. Enables scalability to large networks (including Vision Transformers) and richer variational density families.

Result: Empirical demonstration on several benchmarks including visual recognition and time-series forecasting with large-scale deep networks shows the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed score-based variational inference method provides a scalable alternative to ELBO-based approaches for Bayesian neural networks, enabling application to large-scale networks while maintaining the benefits of Bayesian approaches.

Abstract: Bayesian (deep) neural networks (BNN) are often more attractive than the mainstream point-estimate vanilla deep learning in various aspects including uncertainty quantification, robustness to noise, resistance to overfitting, and more. The variational inference (VI) is one of the most widely adopted approximate inference methods. Whereas the ELBO-based variational free energy method is a dominant choice in the literature, in this paper we introduce a score-based alternative for BNN variational inference. Although there have been quite a few score-based variational inference methods proposed in the community, most are not adequate for large-scale BNNs for various computational and technical reasons. We propose a novel scalable VI method where the learning objective combines the score matching loss and the proximal penalty term in iterations, which helps our method avoid the reparametrized sampling, and allows for noisy unbiased mini-batch scores through stochastic gradients. This in turn makes our method scalable to large-scale neural networks including Vision Transformers, and allows for richer variational density families. On several benchmarks including visual recognition and time-series forecasting with large-scale deep networks, we empirically show the effectiveness of our approach.

*Wei Liu,Jiawei Xu,Yingru Li,Longtao Zheng,Tianjian Li,Qian Liu,Junxian He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dr.Kernel-14B, an LLM trained with novel RL techniques to generate high-performance GPU kernels, achieving competitive results with state-of-the-art models like Claude-4.5-Sonnet and GPT-5 on kernel optimization benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality kernel generation is crucial for scalable AI systems, but training LLMs for this task faces challenges including insufficient data, reward hacking, and lazy optimization where models prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup.

Method: Developed KernelGYM (distributed GPU environment with reward hacking checks), proposed TRLOO (Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out) to address biased policy gradients in multi-turn RL, incorporated mismatch correction for stability, and introduced Profiling-based Rewards (PR) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling (PRS) to overcome lazy optimization.

Result: Dr.Kernel-14B achieves 31.6% of kernels with ≥1.2x speedup over Torch reference on KernelBench Level-2, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). With best-candidate selection across turns, this increases to 47.8%.

Conclusion: The systematic RL approach with KernelGYM environment and novel training techniques enables effective kernel generation, with Dr.Kernel-14B demonstrating competitive performance against leading proprietary models while providing open-source resources.

Abstract: High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM, we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out (TRLOO) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards (PR) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling (PRS) to overcome the issue. The trained model, Dr.Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for Dr.Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%.

### [305] [Escaping Local Minima Provably in Non-convex Matrix Sensing: A Deterministic Framework via Simulated Lifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05887)
*Tianqi Shen,Jinji Yang,Junze He,Kunhan Gao,Ziye Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deterministic framework called Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escapes spurious local minima in low-rank matrix sensing by simulating over-parameterized escape directions without actual tensor lifting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-rank matrix sensing has challenging nonconvex landscapes with many spurious local minima. While over-parameterization via tensor lifting can convert local minima to saddle points, actual lifting is computationally intractable for large problems.

Method: Propose Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism that simulates the landscape and escape directions of over-parametrized space without actual tensor lifting. Mathematical framework projects over-parametrized escape directions onto original parameter space to guarantee strict decrease from local minima.

Result: Numerical experiments show framework reliably escapes local minima and facilitates convergence to global optima with minimal computational cost compared to explicit tensor over-parameterization.

Conclusion: First deterministic framework to escape spurious local minima with guarantee, without random perturbations or heuristic estimates. Has implications for nonconvex optimization beyond matrix sensing by showing how simulated over-parameterization can tame challenging landscapes.

Abstract: Low-rank matrix sensing is a fundamental yet challenging nonconvex problem whose optimization landscape typically contains numerous spurious local minima, making it difficult for gradient-based optimizers to converge to the global optimum. Recent work has shown that over-parameterization via tensor lifting can convert such local minima into strict saddle points, an insight that also partially explains why massive scaling can improve generalization and performance in modern machine learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism that simulates the landscape and escape direction of the over-parametrized space, without resorting to actually lifting the problem, since that would be computationally intractable. In essence, we designed a mathematical framework to project over-parametrized escape directions onto the original parameter space to guarantee a strict decrease of objective value from existing local minima. To the best of the our knowledge, this represents the first deterministic framework that could escape spurious local minima with guarantee, especially without using random perturbations or heuristic estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework reliably escapes local minima and facilitates convergence to global optima, while incurring minimal computational cost when compared to explicit tensor over-parameterization. We believe this framework has non-trivial implications for nonconvex optimization beyond matrix sensing, by showcasing how simulated over-parameterization can be leveraged to tame challenging optimization landscapes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFPO is a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps instead of independent quantiles, improving training stability and generalization under noisy supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL systems struggle with noisy supervision and poor OOD generalization in real-world environments, especially for LLM post-training. Existing distributional RL methods have rough-grained value representations that lack fine-grained state conditioning, limiting their effectiveness under complex and OOD conditions.

Method: DFPO models values as continuous flows across time steps by learning a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions. It integrates conditional risk control and consistency constraints along value flow trajectories to stabilize training under noisy feedback.

Result: DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other robust baselines on dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific tasks under noisy supervision, achieving improved training stability and generalization.

Conclusion: Modeling values as continuous flows with conditional risk and consistency control provides a more robust distributional RL approach that addresses the challenges of noisy supervision and poor OOD generalization in real-world applications.

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) systems in real-world environments remains challenging due to noisy supervision and poor out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, especially in LLM post-training. Recent distributional RL methods improve robustness by modeling values with multiple quantile points, but they still learn each quantile independently as a scalar. This results in rough-grained value representations that lack fine-grained conditioning on state information, struggling under complex and OOD conditions. We propose DFPO (Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control), a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps. By scaling value modeling through learning of a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions, DFPO captures richer state information for more accurate advantage estimation. To stabilize training under noisy feedback, DFPO further integrates conditional risk control and consistency constraints along value flow trajectories. Experiments on dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific tasks show that DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other robust baselines under noisy supervision, achieving improved training stability and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLM-based coding agents focus mainly on final task success, providing limited insight into how agents actually retrieve and use code context during problem solving. There's a need for process-oriented evaluation that examines context retrieval behavior.

Method: Created ContextBench with 1,136 issue-resolution tasks from 66 repositories across 8 programming languages, each augmented with human-annotated gold contexts. Implemented automated evaluation framework tracking agent trajectories and measuring context recall, precision, and efficiency throughout issue resolution.

Result: Sophisticated agent scaffolding yields only marginal gains in context retrieval ("The Bitter Lesson"), LLMs consistently favor recall over precision, and substantial gaps exist between explored and utilized context. Evaluated four frontier LLMs and five coding agents.

Conclusion: ContextBench provides valuable intermediate metrics that complement existing end-to-end benchmarks by unboxing the issue-resolution process. These gold-context metrics offer intermediate signals for guiding LLM reasoning in software tasks.

TL;DR: 1-layer transformers cannot solve PARITY; new 2-layer construction works with practical features (softmax, length-independent PE, no layernorm, causal masking).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite transformers being around for a decade, we still lack understanding of their computational limits. The paper aims to determine what transformers can/cannot compute, specifically focusing on PARITY problem, addressing limitations of previous constructions.

Method: Provides new transformer construction for PARITY using 2 layers with practical features: softmax, length-independent polynomially bounded positional encoding, no layernorm, works with/without causal masking. Also proves lower bound showing PARITY cannot be solved with only 1 layer and 1 head.

Result: First lower bound established: PARITY cannot be solved by transformers with only 1 layer and 1 head. New construction shows PARITY can be solved with 2 layers using practical, implementable transformer components.

Conclusion: The paper advances understanding of transformer computational capabilities, showing PARITY requires at least 2 layers and providing the first practical construction that works with standard transformer components.

Abstract: The transformer architecture is almost a decade old. Despite that, we still have a limited understanding of what this architecture can or cannot compute. For instance, can a 1-layer transformer solve PARITY -- or more generally -- which kinds of transformers can do it? Known constructions for PARITY have at least 2 layers and employ impractical features: either a length-dependent positional encoding, or hardmax, or layernorm without the regularization parameter, or they are not implementable with causal masking.
  We give a new construction of a transformer for PARITY with softmax, length-independent and polynomially bounded positional encoding, no layernorm, working both with and without causal masking. We also give the first lower bound for transformers solving PARITY -- by showing that it cannot be done with only one layer and one head.

*Seohyeon Cha,Huancheng Chen,Dongjun Kim,Haoran Zhang,Kevin Chan,Gustavo de Veciana,Haris Vikalo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a post-training quantization method for LLMs that uses regularized asymmetric calibration and bounded search to improve quantization quality with modest computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM deployment faces memory and latency challenges due to billions of parameters. Post-training quantization helps but its effectiveness depends on quantization objectives and rounding procedures. Current methods need better trade-offs between quantization quality and computational cost.

Method: Uses interpolation between symmetric and asymmetric calibration as regularization, preserving quadratic PTQ structure while handling activation mismatch. Develops successive rounding procedure incorporating asymmetric calibration, plus bounded-search extension for explicit quality-compute trade-off.

Result: Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks show consistent improvements in perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, with only modest additional computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed regularized asymmetric calibration with bounded search provides an effective approach for LLM quantization, balancing quality improvements with controllable computational overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver robust performance across diverse applications, yet their deployment often faces challenges due to the memory and latency costs of storing and accessing billions of parameters. Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch. Building on this perspective, we derive a simple successive rounding procedure that naturally incorporates asymmetric calibration, as well as a bounded-search extension that allows for an explicit trade-off between quantization quality and the compute cost. Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.

*András Balogh,Márk Jelasity*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sequence models trained on chess games are not sound (can't guarantee valid moves), but adversarial testing reveals which training methods improve soundness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop practical tools for verifying whether generative sequence models capture the true structure of languages (world models), using chess as a test domain with simple rule-based world model.

Method: Adversarial sequence generation that creates valid chess sequences to force models to predict invalid next moves; evaluation on chess models trained with different recipes (random vs high-quality games); analysis of board state probes.

Result: No models were completely sound, but some training techniques and dataset choices improved soundness remarkably; board state probes showed no causal role in next token prediction for most models.

Conclusion: Adversarial testing effectively reveals soundness limitations and failure modes in sequence models; while perfect soundness is unattainable, training improvements can enhance model reliability in following language rules.

Abstract: Generative sequence models are typically trained on sample sequences from natural or formal languages. It is a crucial question whether -- or to what extent -- sample-based training is able to capture the true structure of these languages, often referred to as the ``world model''. Theoretical results indicate that we can hope for soundness at best, that is, generating valid sequences, but not necessarily all of them. However, it is still important to have practical tools that are able to verify whether a given sequence model is sound. In this study, we focus on chess, as it is a domain that provides enough complexity while having a simple rule-based world model. We propose adversarial sequence generation for verifying the soundness of the sequence model. Our adversaries generate valid sequences so as to force the sequence model to generate an invalid next move prediction. Apart from the falsification of soundness, this method is also suitable for a more fine-grained analysis of the failure modes and the effects of different choices during training. To demonstrate this, we propose a number of methods for adversarial sequence generation and evaluate the approach on a large set of chess models. We train models on random as well as high-quality chess games, using several training recipes. We find that none of the models are sound, but some training techniques and dataset choices are able to improve soundness remarkably. We also investigate the potential application of board state probes in both our training and attack methods. Our findings indicate that the extracted board states have no causal role in next token prediction in most of the models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SURF and TURF tools to detect and trace unintended behaviors in LLMs caused by spurious correlations in post-training data chunks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM post-training datasets contain incidental patterns alongside intended behaviors, creating spurious correlations that lead to surprising model behaviors like rejecting true facts based on formatting. These "chunky post-training" issues are often invisible to developers but salient to models.

Method: Introduces SURF (a black-box pipeline to surface unintended behaviors at runtime) and TURF (a tool to trace these failures back to specific post-training data). Applied to frontier models (Claude 4.5, GPT-5.1, Grok 4.1, Gemini 3) and open models (Tülu 3).

Result: Chunky post-training produces miscalibrated behaviors, which often result from imbalanced or underspecified chunks of post-training data. The tools successfully detect and trace these unintended behaviors across various models.

Conclusion: Post-training data chunks create spurious correlations that lead to unintended model behaviors, and the proposed SURF/TURF tools provide effective methods for detecting and tracing these issues, highlighting the need for more careful post-training data curation.

Abstract: LLM post-training involves many diverse datasets, each targeting a specific behavior. But these datasets encode incidental patterns alongside intended ones: correlations between formatting and content, narrow phrasings across diverse problems, and implicit associations arising from the discrete data curation process. These patterns are often invisible to developers yet salient to models, producing behaviors that surprise their creators, such as rejecting true facts presented in a particular question format. We call this chunky post-training: the model learns spurious correlations as a result of distinct chunks of post-training data. We introduce SURF, a black-box pipeline which surfaces these unintended behaviors at run time, and TURF, a tool that traces these failures back to specific post-training data. Applying these tools to frontier models (Claude 4.5, GPT-5.1, Grok 4.1, Gemini 3) and open models (Tülu 3), we show that chunky post-training produces miscalibrated behaviors, which often result from imbalanced or underspecified chunks of post-training data.

TL;DR: PMD-mean approximates PMD's log-partition term with mean reward, enabling practical RL for LLMs with adaptive mixed KL-χ² regularization for stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy mirror descent (PMD) is principled but requires partition function estimation, which is challenging in LLMs' vast action spaces with limited rollouts. Need practical approximation.

Method: PMD-mean approximates log-partition term with mean reward under sampling policy, performs regression in log-policy space. Implicitly optimizes mirror descent with adaptive mixed KL-χ² regularizer.

Result: PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency on math reasoning tasks. Additional χ² regularization constrains large probability changes, enhancing robustness against finite-sample errors.

Conclusion: PMD-mean provides practical PMD approximation for LLM RL, offering deeper understanding and pathways for principled RL algorithm improvements. Code available.

Abstract: Policy mirror descent (PMD) provides a principled framework for reinforcement learning (RL) by iteratively solving KL-regularized policy improvement subproblems. While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--$χ^2$ regularizer. This additional $χ^2$ regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency. These findings deepen our understanding of PMD-mean and illuminate pathways toward principled improvements in RL algorithms for LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKimi.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of tuning out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors without requiring a separate OOD dataset, proposing a new approach that uses only the training data of the neural network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detectors require an ad-hoc OOD dataset for tuning, which may not be available or representative of actual unknown OOD data. Performance varies significantly based on the chosen dataset, creating a practical limitation for real-world deployment.

Method: The paper introduces a new generic approach for OOD detector tuning that doesn't require any extra data beyond what's used to train the neural network. It also presents strong baselines for this problem setting.

Result: The proposed approach consistently improves over baseline methods for higher-parameter OOD detector families, while performing comparably for lower-parameter families.

Conclusion: The paper formalizes the important problem of OOD detector tuning without external OOD datasets and provides a practical solution that reduces dependency on potentially unrepresentative ad-hoc datasets.

Abstract: Existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors are often tuned by a separate dataset deemed OOD with respect to the training distribution of a neural network (NN). OOD detectors process the activations of NN layers and score the output, where parameters of the detectors are determined by fitting to an in-distribution (training) set and the aforementioned dataset chosen adhocly. At detector training time, this adhoc dataset may not be available or difficult to obtain, and even when it's available, it may not be representative of actual OOD data, which is often ''unknown unknowns." Current benchmarks may specify some left-out set from test OOD sets. We show that there can be significant variance in performance of detectors based on the adhoc dataset chosen in current literature, and thus even if such a dataset can be collected, the performance of the detector may be highly dependent on the choice. In this paper, we introduce and formalize the often neglected problem of tuning OOD detectors without a given ``OOD'' dataset. To this end, we present strong baselines as an attempt to approach this problem. Furthermore, we propose a new generic approach to OOD detector tuning that does not require any extra data other than those used to train the NN. We show that our approach improves over baseline methods consistently across higher-parameter OOD detector families, while being comparable across lower-parameter families.

Conclusion: Geometry-aware dimensionality reduction using Riemannian methods is crucial for modern machine learning applications dealing with manifold-structured data, offering theoretical foundations and practical advantages over traditional Euclidean approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate Riemannian geometry based dimensionality reduction methods that respect the underlying manifold structure of the data. In particular, we focus on Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA) as a nonlinear generalization of PCA for manifold valued data, and extend discriminant analysis through Riemannian adaptations of other known dimensionality reduction methods. These approaches exploit geodesic distances, tangent space representations, and intrinsic statistical measures to achieve more faithful low dimensional embeddings. We also discuss related manifold learning techniques and highlight their theoretical foundations and practical advantages. Experimental results on representative datasets demonstrate that Riemannian methods provide improved representation quality and classification performance compared to their Euclidean counterparts, especially for data constrained to curved spaces such as hyperspheres and symmetric positive definite manifolds.

Motivation: Current model merging methods use linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which destroys intrinsic geometric properties of pretrained weights like hyperspherical energy. There's a need to preserve these geometric structures during merging.

Method: OrthoMerge performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by orthogonal groups. It maps task-specific orthogonal matrices from Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra for principled integration. For non-OFT models, it uses Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling to extract orthogonal components via orthogonal Procrustes problem, merging them on the orthogonal group manifold while processing residuals with standard additive merging.

Result: Extensive empirical results show OrthoMerge effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and maintains model performance across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: OrthoMerge provides a principled approach to model merging that preserves geometric structure, offering advantages over traditional linear merging methods in Euclidean space.

Abstract: Merging finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly important for integrating diverse capabilities into a single unified model. However, prevailing model merging methods rely on linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which often destroys the intrinsic geometric properties of pretrained weights, such as hyperspherical energy. To address this, we propose Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method that performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group to preserve the geometric structure of the model's weights. By mapping task-specific orthogonal matrices learned by Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra, OrthoMerge enables a principled yet efficient integration that takes into account both the direction and intensity of adaptations. In addition to directly leveraging orthogonal matrices obtained by OFT, we further extend this approach to general models finetuned with non-OFT methods (i.e., low-rank finetuning, full finetuning) via an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy. This technique extracts the orthogonal components of expert models by solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which are then merged on the manifold of the orthogonal group, while the remaining linear residuals are processed through standard additive merging. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of OrthoMerge in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining model performance across diverse tasks.

### [316] [Inverse Depth Scaling From Most Layers Being Similar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05970)
*Yizhou Liu,Sara Kangaslahti,Ziming Liu,Jeff Gore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural scaling laws show loss scales inversely with depth in LLMs, likely due to functionally similar layers acting as ensembles rather than compositional learning, suggesting architectural innovations are needed for more efficient depth utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While neural scaling laws relate loss to model size, the specific contributions of depth versus width remain unclear. The paper aims to quantify how depth specifically affects loss in LLMs to understand the mechanisms behind depth scaling and identify potential inefficiencies in current architectures.

Method: The researchers analyze both large language models and toy residual networks to study depth scaling. They examine how loss scales with depth and investigate the underlying mechanisms through theoretical analysis and empirical observations of layer functionality.

Result: Loss scales inversely proportional to depth in LLMs (L ∝ 1/depth). This scaling likely occurs because layers in deep networks become functionally similar and reduce error through ensemble averaging effects rather than through compositional learning or discretizing smooth dynamics.

Conclusion: Current depth scaling in LLMs is inefficient but robust, resulting from residual network architectural bias and target functions incompatible with smooth dynamics. Improving LLM efficiency requires architectural innovations that encourage more compositional use of depth rather than ensemble-like behavior.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws relate loss to model size in large language models (LLMs), yet depth and width may contribute to performance differently, requiring more detailed studies. Here, we quantify how depth affects loss via analysis of LLMs and toy residual networks. We find loss scales inversely proportional to depth in LLMs, probably due to functionally similar layers reducing error through ensemble averaging rather than compositional learning or discretizing smooth dynamics. This regime is inefficient yet robust and may arise from the architectural bias of residual networks and target functions incompatible with smooth dynamics. The findings suggest that improving LLM efficiency may require architectural innovations to encourage compositional use of depth.

TL;DR: The paper proposes f-GRPO and f-HAL, divergence-based alignment methods for LLMs that work with both preference alignment and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend divergence-based preference alignment to general alignment settings like RLVR where only environmental rewards are available, creating a unified framework for LLM alignment.

Method: Proposes f-GRPO (on-policy RL) and f-HAL (hybrid on/off-policy objectives) based on variational representation of f-divergences for general LLM alignment.

Result: Theoretical guarantees of average reward improvement; empirical validation on RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA tasks (Safety Alignment) shows superior performance and flexibility.

Conclusion: The divergence-based framework provides a unified approach to LLM alignment that works across different settings and outperforms current methods.

Abstract: Recent research shows that Preference Alignment (PA) objectives act as divergence estimators between aligned (chosen) and unaligned (rejected) response distributions. In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general alignment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environmental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we propose $f$-Group Relative Policy Optimization ($f$-GRPO), a class of on-policy reinforcement learning, and $f$-Hybrid Alignment Loss ($f$-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of $f$-divergences. We provide theoretical guarantees that these classes of objectives improve the average reward after alignment. Empirically, we validate our framework on both RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA tasks (Safety Alignment), demonstrating superior performance and flexibility compared to current methods.

### [319] [Breaking Symmetry Bottlenecks in GNN Readouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05950)
*Mouad Talhi,Arne Wolf,Anthea Monod*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a fundamental expressivity bottleneck in GNN readout layers, shows linear permutation-invariant pooling collapses symmetry-aware information, and introduces projector-based readouts to overcome this limitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs have known expressivity limitations in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs, traditionally attributed to message passing. The authors identify an independent bottleneck at the readout stage that hasn't been properly characterized.

Method: Using finite-dimensional representation theory, the authors prove linear permutation-invariant readouts (sum/mean pooling) project node embeddings onto the fixed subspace, erasing symmetry-aware components. They introduce projector-based invariant readouts that decompose representations into symmetry-aware channels and summarize with nonlinear invariant statistics.

Result: Theoretical analysis reveals a new expressivity barrier. Empirically, swapping only the readout enables fixed encoders to separate WL-hard graph pairs and improves performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating readout design is decisive for GNN expressivity.

Conclusion: Readout design is a critical and under-appreciated factor in GNN expressivity. The proposed projector-based invariant readouts overcome the collapse of symmetry-aware information while maintaining permutation invariance, providing both theoretical insights and practical improvements.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for learning on structured data, yet their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs is fundamentally limited. These limitations are usually attributed to message passing; in this work we show that an independent bottleneck arises at the readout stage. Using finite-dimensional representation theory, we prove that all linear permutation-invariant readouts, including sum and mean pooling, factor through the Reynolds (group-averaging) operator and therefore project node embeddings onto the fixed subspace of the permutation action, erasing all non-trivial symmetry-aware components regardless of encoder expressivity. This yields both a new expressivity barrier and an interpretable characterization of what global pooling preserves or destroys. To overcome this collapse, we introduce projector-based invariant readouts that decompose node representations into symmetry-aware channels and summarize them with nonlinear invariant statistics, preserving permutation invariance while retaining information provably invisible to averaging. Empirically, swapping only the readout enables fixed encoders to separate WL-hard graph pairs and improves performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that readout design is a decisive and under-appreciated factor in GNN expressivity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers, generalizes them to Schrödinger bridges between arbitrary distributions, and applies them to data-free posterior sampling in discrete latent spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While diffusion samplers have been successful for continuous-space sampling, their application to discrete spaces remains under-explored and doesn't fully leverage techniques from continuous-space sampling. There's a need to bridge this gap and improve discrete sampling performance.

Method: Proposes off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers, generalizes them to data-to-energy Schrödinger bridge training for arbitrary distributions in discrete domains, and applies these methods to posterior sampling in discrete latent spaces of image generative models.

Result: Off-policy techniques improve discrete sampler performance on established and new synthetic benchmarks. The paper successfully introduces Schrödinger bridge training to discrete domains and demonstrates practical application to data-free posterior sampling in discrete latent spaces.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges the gap between continuous and discrete diffusion sampling by introducing off-policy training techniques and Schrödinger bridge methods, enabling more effective discrete-space sampling with practical applications in generative modeling.

Abstract: Sampling from a distribution $p(x) \propto e^{-\mathcal{E}(x)}$ known up to a normalising constant is an important and challenging problem in statistics. Recent years have seen the rise of a new family of amortised sampling algorithms, commonly referred to as diffusion samplers, that enable fast and efficient sampling from an unnormalised density. Such algorithms have been widely studied for continuous-space sampling tasks; however, their application to problems in discrete space remains largely unexplored. Although some progress has been made in this area, discrete diffusion samplers do not take full advantage of ideas commonly used for continuous-space sampling. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by introducing off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers. We show that these techniques improve the performance of discrete samplers on both established and new synthetic benchmarks. Next, we generalise discrete diffusion samplers to the task of bridging between two arbitrary distributions, introducing data-to-energy Schrödinger bridge training for the discrete domain for the first time. Lastly, we showcase the application of the proposed diffusion samplers to data-free posterior sampling in the discrete latent spaces of image generative models.

TL;DR: Diamond Maps are stochastic flow map models that enable efficient reward alignment at inference time, outperforming existing methods in adaptability and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flow and diffusion models produce high-quality samples but adapting them to user preferences or constraints post-training is costly and brittle (reward alignment challenge). The authors argue that efficient reward alignment should be built into the generative model design rather than treated as an afterthought.

Method: Propose "Diamond Maps" - stochastic flow map models that amortize many simulation steps into a single-step sampler while preserving necessary stochasticity for optimal reward alignment. This design enables efficient and consistent estimation of the value function, making search, sequential Monte Carlo, and guidance scalable. Diamond Maps can be learned efficiently via distillation from GLASS Flows.

Result: Experiments show Diamond Maps can be learned efficiently, achieve stronger reward alignment performance, and scale better than existing methods.

Conclusion: Diamond Maps provide a practical route to generative models that can be rapidly adapted to arbitrary preferences and constraints at inference time, addressing the fundamental challenge of reward alignment in generative modeling.

Abstract: Flow and diffusion models produce high-quality samples, but adapting them to user preferences or constraints post-training remains costly and brittle, a challenge commonly called reward alignment. We argue that efficient reward alignment should be a property of the generative model itself, not an afterthought, and redesign the model for adaptability. We propose "Diamond Maps", stochastic flow map models that enable efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time. Diamond Maps amortize many simulation steps into a single-step sampler, like flow maps, while preserving the stochasticity required for optimal reward alignment. This design makes search, sequential Monte Carlo, and guidance scalable by enabling efficient and consistent estimation of the value function. Our experiments show that Diamond Maps can be learned efficiently via distillation from GLASS Flows, achieve stronger reward alignment performance, and scale better than existing methods. Our results point toward a practical route to generative models that can be rapidly adapted to arbitrary preferences and constraints at inference time.

*Mohamad Amin Jamshidi,Mehrbod Zarifi,Zolfa Anvari,Hamed Ghafarirad,Mohammad Zareinejad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid LSTM-Random Forest algorithm for real-time friction force estimation in hydraulic cylinders achieves <10% error with 1.51ms computation time, outperforming traditional analytical models like LuGre.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hydraulic cylinders require accurate friction models for precision control, but existing analytical models (like LuGre) lack adaptability and computational efficiency for real-time applications across varying operating conditions.

Method: Data-driven hybrid algorithm combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests for nonlinear friction force estimation, trained on experimental data from a hydraulic test setup.

Result: Achieves consistent model error <10% across diverse operating conditions and external loads, with computational cost of 1.51 milliseconds per estimation, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid LSTM-Random Forest approach overcomes limitations of analytical friction models by providing high precision, computational efficiency, and adaptability to varying conditions, validated through experimental comparisons with the LuGre model.

Abstract: Hydraulic systems are widely utilized in industrial applications due to their high force generation, precise control, and ability to function in harsh environments. Hydraulic cylinders, as actuators in these systems, apply force and position through the displacement of hydraulic fluid, but their operation is significantly influenced by friction force. Achieving precision in hydraulic cylinders requires an accurate friction model under various operating conditions. Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency. This research introduces a data-driven, hybrid algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests for nonlinear friction force estimation. The algorithm effectively combines feature detection and estimation processes using training data acquired from an experimental hydraulic test setup. It achieves a consistent and stable model error of less than 10% across diverse operating conditions and external load variations, ensuring robust performance in complex situations. The computational cost of the algorithm is 1.51 milliseconds per estimation, making it suitable for real-time applications. The proposed method addresses the limitations of analytical models by delivering high precision and computational efficiency. The algorithm's performance is validated through detailed analysis and experimental results, including direct comparisons with the LuGre model. The comparison highlights that while the LuGre model offers a theoretical foundation for friction modeling, its performance is limited by its inability to dynamically adjust to varying operational conditions of the hydraulic cylinder, further emphasizing the advantages of the proposed hybrid approach in real-time applications.

### [323] [Optimism Stabilizes Thompson Sampling for Adaptive Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06014)
*Shunxing Yan,Han Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Thompson sampling needs optimism modifications for valid asymptotic inference in multi-armed bandits due to adaptive data collection issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Thompson sampling has inferential problems under adaptive data collection because arm-specific sample sizes are random and coupled with rewards through action selection, making classical asymptotic theory fail.

Method: Study K-armed Gaussian bandits and identify optimism as key mechanism for stability. Analyze two approaches: 1) variance-inflated Thompson sampling, 2) alternative optimistic modification that adds explicit mean bonus to posterior mean while keeping variance unchanged.

Result: Prove variance-inflated TS is stable for any K≥2, resolving open question from previous work. Show alternative optimistic modification also achieves stability. Both enable asymptotically valid inference with only mild additional regret cost.

Conclusion: Suitably implemented optimism stabilizes Thompson sampling and enables asymptotically valid inference in multi-armed bandits while maintaining reasonable performance.

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is widely used for stochastic multi-armed bandits, yet its inferential properties under adaptive data collection are subtle. Classical asymptotic theory for sample means can fail because arm-specific sample sizes are random and coupled with the rewards through the action-selection rule. We study this phenomenon in the $K$-armed Gaussian bandit and identify \emph{optimism} as a key mechanism for restoring \emph{stability}, a sufficient condition for valid asymptotic inference requiring each arm's pull count to concentrate around a deterministic scale. First, we prove that variance-inflated TS \citep{halder2025stable} is stable for any $K \ge 2$, including the challenging regime where multiple arms are optimal. This resolves the open question raised by \citet{halder2025stable} through extending their results from the two-armed setting to the general $K$-armed setting. Second, we analyze an alternative optimistic modification that keeps the posterior variance unchanged but adds an explicit mean bonus to posterior mean, and establish the same stability conclusion. In summary, suitably implemented optimism stabilizes Thompson sampling and enables asymptotically valid inference in multi-armed bandits, while incurring only a mild additional regret cost.

*Miranda Muqing Miao,Young-Min Cho,Lyle Ungar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CORAL is an inference-time steering method that improves LLM calibration and accuracy by extracting distributed correctness signals from model activations using regularized MLP probes, achieving ~10% accuracy and ~50% calibration improvements without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from persistent miscalibration after instruction tuning and preference alignment. While modified training objectives can help, retraining is expensive. Existing inference-time methods optimize proxies for correctness rather than correctness itself.

Method: CORAL (Correctness-Optimized Residual Activation Lens) uses weight-decay MLP probes to capture distributed correctness signals from model internal activations during inference. It's a regularized inference-time steering approach that doesn't require retraining.

Result: CORAL consistently improves accuracy by 10% and expected calibration error (ECE) by 50% on average across three 7B-parameter models. Gains transfer to four held-out benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, Math-MC, OpenBookQA) with 14% accuracy and 49% ECE improvements.

Conclusion: Distributed information in model internals can be extracted using regularized probes when individual neurons are insufficient. CORAL provides a compute-efficient, transferable, and calibration-aware approach to improve MCQA performance during inference without retraining.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit persistent miscalibration, especially after instruction tuning and preference alignment. Modified training objectives can improve calibration, but retraining is expensive. Inference-time steering offers a lightweight alternative, yet most existing methods optimize proxies for correctness rather than correctness itself. We introduce CORAL (Correctness-Optimized Residual Activation Lens), a regularized inference-time steering method that captures distributed correctness signals from model internal activations using weight-decay MLP probes. We evaluate CORAL across three 7B-parameter models and find that it consistently improves accuracy by 10\% and expected calibration error (ECE) by 50\% on average. We additionally demonstrate that these gains transfer without retraining to the complete published test sets of four held-out benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, Math-MC, OpenBookQA), averaging 14\% accuracy improvements and 49\% ECE improvements. Our results support the hypothesis that distributed information in model internals can be extracted using regularized probes when individual neurons are insufficient. CORAL thus provides a compute-efficient, transferable, and calibration-aware approach to improve MCQA performance during inference.

*Keith Ando Ogawa,Bruno Lopes Yamamoto,Lucas Lauton de Alcantara,Lucas Pellicer,Rosimeire Pereira Costa,Edson Bollis,Anna Helena Reali Costa,Artur Jordao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Layer-wise LoRA with CKA reduces trainable parameters by up to 50% by selectively fine-tuning only the most relevant layers while maintaining performance across various models and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs continue to scale, even parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA (which already reduce parameters by 99%) become insufficient. The authors argue that not all layers contribute equally to model adaptation, so selectively fine-tuning only the most relevant layers could further reduce computational costs.

Method: The method systematically selects only a few layers to fine-tune using LoRA or its variants. It identifies the most relevant layers by measuring their contribution to changes in internal representations using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). This approach is orthogonal and compatible with existing low-rank adaptation techniques.

Result: The method reduces trainable parameters in LoRA-based techniques by up to 50% while maintaining predictive performance. On encoder-only architectures, there's negligible performance drop on GLUE benchmark. On decoder-only architectures, there's small drop or even improvements in mathematical problem-solving and coding tasks. The approach also works effectively for multimodal models.

Conclusion: Layer-wise selective fine-tuning using CKA-based layer selection significantly reduces computational costs of fine-tuning large models while preserving or even improving performance, making it a practical solution for scaling parameter-efficient fine-tuning as models continue to grow.

Abstract: Pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) on web-scale datasets becomes fundamental for advancing general-purpose AI. In contrast, enhancing their predictive performance on downstream tasks typically involves adapting their knowledge through fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aim to reduce the computational cost of this process by freezing the pre-trained model and updating a smaller number of parameters. In comparison to full fine-tuning, these methods achieve over 99\% reduction in trainable parameter count, depending on the configuration. Unfortunately, such a reduction may prove insufficient as LLMs continue to grow in scale. In this work, we address the previous problem by systematically selecting only a few layers to fine-tune using LoRA or its variants. We argue that not all layers contribute equally to the model adaptation. Leveraging this, we identify the most relevant layers to fine-tune by measuring their contribution to changes in internal representations. Our method is orthogonal to and readily compatible with existing low-rank adaptation techniques. We reduce the trainable parameters in LoRA-based techniques by up to 50\%, while maintaining the predictive performance across different models and tasks. Specifically, on encoder-only architectures, this reduction in trainable parameters leads to a negligible predictive performance drop on the GLUE benchmark. On decoder-only architectures, we achieve a small drop or even improvements in the predictive performance on mathematical problem-solving capabilities and coding tasks. Finally, this effectiveness extends to multimodal models, for which we also observe competitive results relative to fine-tuning with LoRA modules in all layers.

*Leo Zhang,James Martens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OSA is a novel orthogonal attention mechanism that replaces softmax self-attention to prevent rank collapse and improve Jacobian conditioning in skipless Transformers, with linear computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) in skipless Transformer architectures suffers from instability issues including rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians, which hinders training of Transformers without skip connections and normalization layers.

Method: OSA parametrizes attention matrix to be orthogonal by mapping a skew-symmetric matrix (formed from query-key values) through matrix exponential. Uses low-rank structure of query-key values for practical implementation with linear computational complexity and memory cost scaling.

Result: OSA enables training of non-causal Transformers without skip connections and normalization layers. The method includes a proven initialization scheme that ensures well-conditioned Jacobian of OSA.

Conclusion: OSA provides a stable alternative to SSA for skipless Transformer architectures, addressing fundamental instability issues while maintaining practical computational efficiency.

Abstract: Softmax Self-Attention (SSA) is a key component of Transformer architectures. However, when utilised within skipless architectures, which aim to improve representation learning, recent work has highlighted the inherent instability of SSA due to inducing rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians. In this work, we design a novel attention mechanism: Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), which aims to bypass these issues with SSA, in order to allow for (non-causal) Transformers without skip connections and normalisation layers to be more easily trained. In particular, OSA parametrises the attention matrix to be orthogonal via mapping a skew-symmetric matrix, formed from query-key values, through the matrix exponential. We show that this can be practically implemented, by exploiting the low-rank structure of our query-key values, resulting in the computational complexity and memory cost of OSA scaling linearly with sequence length. Furthermore, we derive an initialisation scheme for which we prove ensures that the Jacobian of OSA is well-conditioned.

*Raj Ghugare,Michał Bortkiewicz,Alicja Ziarko,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Policies using more compute can solve harder problems and generalize better to longer-horizon tasks, even with fixed parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL framework doesn't formally address how compute affects learning, and current approaches conflate compute with parameter count. Need to understand if policies can benefit from additional compute without increasing parameters.

Method: Formalize compute-bounded policies, prove theoretical benefits of more compute, propose minimal architecture that can use variable compute (building on algorithmic learning and model-free planning).

Result: On 31 tasks spanning online/offline RL: (1) Architecture achieves stronger performance with more compute, (2) Better generalization on longer-horizon tasks than feedforward or deep residual networks with 5x more parameters.

Conclusion: Compute is a distinct resource from parameters; policies can leverage additional compute to solve harder problems and generalize better, even with fixed parameter budgets.

Abstract: How does the amount of compute available to a reinforcement learning (RL) policy affect its learning? Can policies using a fixed amount of parameters, still benefit from additional compute? The standard RL framework does not provide a language to answer these questions formally. Empirically, deep RL policies are often parameterized as neural networks with static architectures, conflating the amount of compute and the number of parameters. In this paper, we formalize compute bounded policies and prove that policies which use more compute can solve problems and generalize to longer-horizon tasks that are outside the scope of policies with less compute. Building on prior work in algorithmic learning and model-free planning, we propose a minimal architecture that can use a variable amount of compute. Our experiments complement our theory. On a set 31 different tasks spanning online and offline RL, we show that $(1)$ this architecture achieves stronger performance simply by using more compute, and $(2)$ stronger generalization on longer-horizon test tasks compared to standard feedforward networks or deep residual network using up to 5 times more parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how protein structure prediction models like ESMFold actually fold proteins by investigating the computational mechanisms behind their structural decisions, using a beta hairpin as a case study.

Method: Tracing ESMFold's folding process through counterfactual interventions on model latents, analyzing how the model processes a beta hairpin structural motif, and identifying computational stages in the folding trunk.

Result: Identified two distinct computational stages: 1) Early blocks initialize pairwise biochemical signals (residue identities and features like charge flow), 2) Late blocks develop pairwise spatial features (distance and contact information). Showed that structural decisions can be localized, traced through interpretable representations, and manipulated with strong causal effects.

Conclusion: ESMFold's folding mechanism is decomposable into interpretable computational stages, allowing researchers to understand, trace, and manipulate how the model makes structural predictions, providing insights into protein structure prediction model behavior.

Abstract: How do protein structure prediction models fold proteins? We investigate this question by tracing how ESMFold folds a beta hairpin, a prevalent structural motif. Through counterfactual interventions on model latents, we identify two computational stages in the folding trunk. In the first stage, early blocks initialize pairwise biochemical signals: residue identities and associated biochemical features such as charge flow from sequence representations into pairwise representations. In the second stage, late blocks develop pairwise spatial features: distance and contact information accumulate in the pairwise representation. We demonstrate that the mechanisms underlying structural decisions of ESMFold can be localized, traced through interpretable representations, and manipulated with strong causal effects.

*Yingke Li,Anjali Parashar,Enlu Zhou,Chuchu Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Active inference agents using Expected Free Energy (EFE) need sufficient curiosity to achieve both consistent learning and no-regret decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the fundamental tension in active inference between exploration (epistemic value) and exploitation (pragmatic value). While EFE balances these through a curiosity coefficient, it has been unclear when this balance leads to both coherent learning and efficient decision-making. The authors aim to establish theoretical guarantees for when EFE-minimizing agents succeed.

Method: The authors establish the first theoretical guarantee for EFE-minimizing agents by showing that a single requirement—sufficient curiosity—simultaneously ensures self-consistent learning (Bayesian posterior consistency) and no-regret optimization (bounded cumulative regret). They analyze how this mechanism depends on initial uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment, connecting AIF to classical Bayesian experimental design and Bayesian optimization within one theoretical framework.

Result: The analysis provides theoretical guarantees that sufficient curiosity ensures both Bayesian posterior consistency (coherent learning) and bounded cumulative regret (efficient decision-making). The authors characterize how this depends on initial uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment, and translate these theories into practical design guidelines for tuning the epistemic-pragmatic trade-off.

Conclusion: The paper establishes the first theoretical foundation for EFE-minimizing agents, showing that sufficient curiosity simultaneously guarantees coherent learning and efficient decision-making. This connects active inference to classical Bayesian experimental design and Bayesian optimization, providing practical guidelines for tuning exploration-exploitation trade-offs in hybrid learning-optimization problems.

Abstract: Active inference (AIF) unifies exploration and exploitation by minimizing the Expected Free Energy (EFE), balancing epistemic value (information gain) and pragmatic value (task performance) through a curiosity coefficient. Yet it has been unclear when this balance yields both coherent learning and efficient decision-making: insufficient curiosity can drive myopic exploitation and prevent uncertainty resolution, while excessive curiosity can induce unnecessary exploration and regret. We establish the first theoretical guarantee for EFE-minimizing agents, showing that a single requirement--sufficient curiosity--simultaneously ensures self-consistent learning (Bayesian posterior consistency) and no-regret optimization (bounded cumulative regret). Our analysis characterizes how this mechanism depends on initial uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment, thereby connecting AIF to classical Bayesian experimental design and Bayesian optimization within one theoretical framework. We further translate these theories into practical design guidelines for tuning the epistemic-pragmatic trade-off in hybrid learning-optimization problems, validated through real-world experiments.

*Claus Hofmann,Christian Huber,Bernhard Lehner,Daniel Klotz,Sepp Hochreiter,Werner Zellinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AP-OOD: A novel semi-supervised OOD detection method for text that uses token-level information instead of simple averaging, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods struggle to effectively leverage and aggregate token embeddings from language models to obtain accurate OOD scores. Simple average-based aggregation fails to capture important token-level information needed for reliable OOD detection in natural language tasks.

Method: AP-OOD is a semi-supervised approach that exploits token-level information beyond simple average-based aggregation. It flexibly interpolates between unsupervised and supervised settings, allowing the use of limited auxiliary outlier data to improve detection performance.

Result: AP-OOD achieves state-of-the-art performance in OOD detection for text. In unsupervised settings, it reduces FPR95 from 27.84% to 4.67% on XSUM summarization and from 77.08% to 70.37% on WMT15 En-Fr translation.

Conclusion: AP-OOD demonstrates that leveraging token-level information through a flexible semi-supervised approach significantly improves OOD detection performance in natural language tasks, setting new benchmarks for reliable deployment of language models.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which maps high-dimensional data into a scalar OOD score, is critical for the reliable deployment of machine learning models. A key challenge in recent research is how to effectively leverage and aggregate token embeddings from language models to obtain the OOD score. In this work, we propose AP-OOD, a novel OOD detection method for natural language that goes beyond simple average-based aggregation by exploiting token-level information. AP-OOD is a semi-supervised approach that flexibly interpolates between unsupervised and supervised settings, enabling the use of limited auxiliary outlier data. Empirically, AP-OOD sets a new state of the art in OOD detection for text: in the unsupervised setting, it reduces the FPR95 (false positive rate at 95% true positives) from 27.84% to 4.67% on XSUM summarization, and from 77.08% to 70.37% on WMT15 En-Fr translation.

### [331] [Can vision language models learn intuitive physics from interaction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06033)
*Luca M. Schulze Buschoff,Konstantinos Voudouris,Can Demircan,Eric Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning VLMs with RL through environment interaction improves task performance but fails to develop generalizable physical intuitions across related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models lack robust physical world intuitions. While supervised fine-tuning helps with specific tasks, it doesn't create generalizable physical understanding. The paper hypothesizes that models need interactive learning (like humans) to properly learn physical dynamics.

Method: Train models using reinforcement learning through interaction with environments. Compare models trained with interaction vs. without, testing generalization across related tasks that share visual statistics and physical principles.

Result: Interactive learning improves within-task performance, but models still fail to generalize to related tasks. Models trained on one task don't reliably transfer to other tasks, even when tasks share underlying physical principles and visual characteristics.

Conclusion: Simply adding interaction through RL is insufficient for developing generalizable physical intuitions in vision-language models. More sophisticated approaches are needed to achieve human-like physical understanding that transfers across contexts.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision language models do not have good intuitions about the physical world. Recent work has shown that supervised fine-tuning can improve model performance on simple physical tasks. However, fine-tuned models do not appear to learn robust physical rules that can generalize to new contexts. Based on research in cognitive science, we hypothesize that models need to interact with an environment to properly learn its physical dynamics. We train models that learn through interaction with the environment using reinforcement learning. While learning from interaction allows models to improve their within-task performance, it fails to produce models with generalizable physical intuitions. We find that models trained on one task do not reliably generalize to related tasks, even if the tasks share visual statistics and physical principles, and regardless of whether the models are trained through interaction.

### [332] [Artificial Intelligence as Strange Intelligence: Against Linear Models of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04986)
*Kendra Chilson,Eric Schwitzgebel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the linear model of AI progress, introduces concepts of "familiar" vs "strange" intelligence, and proposes a nonlinear model where general intelligence is not a unified capacity but the ability to achieve diverse goals across varied environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to challenge the prevailing linear model of AI progress and address misconceptions about AI intelligence. They seek to develop a more accurate framework for understanding AI capabilities that accounts for the complex, non-uniform nature of intelligence in artificial systems.

Method: The authors expand on Susan Schneider's critique and introduce two novel conceptual frameworks: "familiar intelligence" (human-like patterns) and "strange intelligence" (AI-specific patterns). They develop a nonlinear model of intelligence where general intelligence is defined as the ability to achieve broad goals across diverse environments, resisting reduction to a single linear metric.

Result: The paper establishes that AI intelligence is likely to be "strange intelligence" - combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in others, and sometimes mixing superhuman insight with surprising errors. This challenges the assumption that intelligence can be measured on a single linear scale.

Conclusion: The nonlinear model has important implications for AI evaluation: 1) Even the most capable AI systems will sometimes fail at seemingly obvious tasks, 2) Such errors alone don't demonstrate lack of general intelligence, 3) Excellent performance on one task type (like IQ tests) doesn't warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that domain, and 4) Adversarial testing approaches need to account for the strange nature of AI intelligence.

Abstract: We endorse and expand upon Susan Schneider's critique of the linear model of AI progress and introduce two novel concepts: "familiar intelligence" and "strange intelligence". AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which "general intelligence" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence. Conversely, excellent performance on one type of task, such as an IQ test, cannot warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that task domain.

### [333] [DeepRead: Document Structure-Aware Reasoning to Enhance Agentic Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05014)
*Zhanli Li,Huiwen Tian,Lvzhou Luo,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepRead is a structure-aware document reasoning agent that improves long-document QA by preserving document hierarchy and enabling multi-turn "locate then read" behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic search frameworks treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors like hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure, which limits their effectiveness for long-document question answering.

Method: DeepRead converts PDFs to structured Markdown preserving headings/paragraphs, indexes at paragraph level with coordinate-style metadata, and provides two tools: Retrieve (localizes relevant paragraphs with structural context) and ReadSection (enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within specified sections).

Result: DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering, with validated synergistic effects between retrieval and reading tools, and demonstrates human-like "locate then read" behavior.

Conclusion: Explicitly operationalizing document structural priors through coordinated retrieval and reading tools enables more effective long-document reasoning, moving beyond flat chunk-based approaches to better mimic human document analysis patterns.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of tool-using and agentic large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is evolving from one-shot, passive retrieval into multi-turn, decision-driven evidence acquisition. Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering. The synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools is also validated. Our fine-grained behavioral analysis reveals a reading and reasoning paradigm resembling human-like ``locate then read'' behavior.

### [334] [MINT: Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree for Objective-Driven Knowledge-Gap Reasoning and Active Elicitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05048)
*Zeyu Fang,Tian Lan,Mahdi Imani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MINT is a neuro-symbolic framework that optimizes AI agent queries to actively elicit human inputs for object-driven planning with knowledge gaps, achieving near-expert performance with minimal questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planning in open-world scenarios involves incomplete information about objects and human goals, creating knowledge gaps that hinder effective human-AI joint planning. Current approaches lack systematic methods for AI agents to actively elicit the right information from humans.

Method: Proposes Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) that builds symbolic trees of possible human-AI interactions, uses neural planning policies to estimate uncertainty from knowledge gaps, leverages LLMs to search reasoning processes and curate optimal queries, and employs self-play to optimize elicitation strategies.

Result: MINT achieves near-expert returns on three benchmarks with unseen/unknown objects, requiring only a limited number of questions per task while significantly improving rewards and success rates compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MINT provides an effective framework for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs through optimized queries, bridging knowledge gaps in object-driven planning and enabling efficient human-AI teaming with minimal interaction overhead.

Abstract: Joint planning through language-based interactions is a key area of human-AI teaming. Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates.

### [335] [Evaluating Large Language Models on Solved and Unsolved Problems in Graph Theory: Implications for Computing Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05059)
*Adithya Kulkarni,Mohna Chakraborty,Jay Bagga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively support exploration of established graph theory concepts but struggle with novel mathematical insight and open problems, highlighting their role as conceptual exploration tools rather than problem-solving agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become integrated into computer science education, particularly for advanced topics like graph theory, there's a need to understand their reliability in supporting mathematically rigorous thinking and problem-solving.

Method: Used an eight-stage evaluation protocol reflecting authentic mathematical inquiry (interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, proof construction) to test an LLM on two graph theory problems: one solved problem about gracefulness of line graphs, and one open problem with no known solution.

Result: The LLM performed strongly on the solved problem - produced correct definitions, identified relevant structures, recalled appropriate results without hallucination, and constructed a valid proof confirmed by an expert. For the open problem, it generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but made no progress toward a solution, while appropriately acknowledging uncertainty.

Conclusion: LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while emphasizing independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem-solving.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used by students to explore advanced material in computer science, including graph theory. As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.
  The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.
  These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this distinction highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while relying on independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem solving.

### [336] [Towards Reducible Uncertainty Modeling for Reliable Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05073)
*Changdae Oh,Seongheon Park,To Eun Kim,Jiatong Li,Wendi Li,Samuel Yeh,Xuefeng Du,Hamed Hassani,Paul Bogdan,Dawn Song,Sharon Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that current uncertainty quantification (UQ) research for LLMs focuses too much on single-turn QA and needs to shift to interactive agent settings, proposing a new conditional uncertainty reduction framework for agent UQ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UQ research for LLMs is inadequate for real-world applications because it focuses on single-turn question-answering while LLM agents are increasingly deployed in complex, interactive tasks. There's a need for a principled framework that addresses uncertainty in interactive agent settings.

Method: The paper presents a general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes existing UQ setups, critiques prior works as treating UQ as uncertainty accumulation, and proposes a novel conditional uncertainty reduction perspective that models reducible uncertainty over agent trajectories by emphasizing action interactivity.

Result: The paper develops a conceptual framework for agent UQ that provides actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups, highlighting the importance of modeling uncertainty reduction through interactive actions rather than treating it as accumulating uncertainty.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with practical implications for frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, identifies open problems in agent UQ, and emphasizes the need to shift UQ research from single-turn settings to realistic interactive agent environments.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs) is a key building block for safety guardrails of daily LLM applications. Yet, even as LLM agents are increasingly deployed in highly complex tasks, most UQ research still centers on single-turn question-answering. We argue that UQ research must shift to realistic settings with interactive agents, and that a new principled framework for agent UQ is needed. This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting "interactivity" of actions. From this perspective, we outline a conceptual framework to provide actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups. Finally, we conclude with practical implications of the agent UQ in frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, as well as open remaining problems.

### [337] [Optimizing Mission Planning for Multi-Debris Rendezvous Using Reinforcement Learning with Refueling and Adaptive Collision Avoidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05075)
*Agni Bandyopadhyay,Gunther Waxenegger-Wilfing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL-based framework for adaptive collision avoidance in active debris removal missions using small satellites, optimizing multi-debris rendezvous with fuel efficiency and real-time maneuver adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing orbital debris congestion creates collision risks for ADR missions, requiring safer and more efficient operations. Small satellites offer flexibility and cost-effectiveness but need intelligent collision avoidance systems for multi-debris removal scenarios.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to dynamically adjust maneuvers based on real-time orbital conditions. Integrates refueling strategies, mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance for multi-debris rendezvous optimization.

Result: The RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches, as demonstrated through simulated ADR scenarios using Iridium 33 debris dataset across diverse orbital configurations.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable solution for complex multi-debris ADR mission planning that is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission operations.

Abstract: As the orbital environment around Earth becomes increasingly crowded with debris, active debris removal (ADR) missions face significant challenges in ensuring safe operations while minimizing the risk of in-orbit collisions. This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.
  Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters.
  The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability. Results show that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.
  This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The VERA-MH evaluation framework shows strong clinical validity and reliability for assessing AI chatbot safety in suicide risk scenarios, with high alignment between clinician ratings and LLM-based automated evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With millions using AI chatbots for psychological support, there's an urgent need for evidence-based safety benchmarks to ensure these tools are safe, especially for high-risk scenarios like suicide prevention.

Method: Simulated conversations between LLM-based user-agents and AI chatbots were independently rated by licensed mental health clinicians using a scoring rubric. An LLM-based judge used the same rubric to evaluate the same conversations, allowing comparison of rating alignment between clinicians and between clinical consensus and the AI judge.

Result: Clinicians showed high inter-rater reliability (0.77), establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with clinical consensus (0.81 IRR). Clinicians generally found the user-agents realistic, supporting the validity of the simulation approach.

Conclusion: The VERA-MH evaluation demonstrates clinical validity and reliability as an automated AI safety benchmark for mental health applications, though further research is needed on generalizability and robustness.

Abstract: Millions now use leading generative AI chatbots for psychological support. Despite the promise related to availability and scale, the single most pressing question in AI for mental health is whether these tools are safe. The Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health (VERA-MH) evaluation was recently proposed to meet the urgent need for an evidence-based automated safety benchmark. This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic. For the potential mental health benefits of AI chatbots to be realized, attention to safety is paramount. Findings from this human evaluation study support the clinical validity and reliability of VERA-MH: an open-source, fully automated AI safety evaluation for mental health. Further research will address VERA-MH generalizability and robustness.

*Agni Bandyopadhyay,Günther Waxenegger-Wilfing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Comparison of three planners for Active Debris Removal: nominal PPO, domain-randomized PPO, and MCTS, showing trade-offs between speed and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADR mission planning requires balancing efficiency, adaptability, and strict fuel/time constraints, needing robust planners that handle distributional shifts.

Method: Three planners compared: 1) nominal Masked PPO trained under fixed parameters, 2) domain-randomized Masked PPO trained across varying constraints, 3) plain MCTS baseline. Evaluated in high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic dynamics, and 300 randomized test cases across nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced time scenarios.

Result: Nominal PPO performs best when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift. Domain-randomized PPO shows improved adaptability with moderate nominal performance loss. MCTS handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but has orders-of-magnitude higher computation time.

Conclusion: There's a trade-off between learned policies' speed and search-based methods' adaptability. Combining training-time diversity with online planning could lead to future resilient ADR mission planners.

Abstract: Autonomous mission planning for Active Debris Removal (ADR) must balance efficiency, adaptability, and strict feasibility constraints on fuel and mission duration. This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time. The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.

TL;DR: GAMMS is a lightweight, graph-based multi-agent simulator designed for scalability and accessibility, supporting rapid prototyping of various agent types including LLM-based agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing high-fidelity simulators are computationally expensive and not suitable for rapid prototyping or large-scale agent deployments, creating a need for more accessible simulation tools.

Method: Developed GAMMS as a graph-based adversarial multiagent modeling simulator with five core objectives: scalability, ease of use, integration-first architecture, fast visualization feedback, and real-world grounding.

Result: Created an open-source framework that enables efficient simulation of complex domains (urban networks, communication systems), supports integration with external tools, provides built-in visualization, and is agnostic to policy type.

Conclusion: GAMMS lowers the barrier to entry for researchers and enables high-performance simulations on standard hardware, facilitating experimentation in multi-agent systems, autonomous planning, and adversarial modeling.

Abstract: As intelligent systems and multi-agent coordination become increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a growing need for simulation tools that are both scalable and accessible. Existing high-fidelity simulators, while powerful, are often computationally expensive and ill-suited for rapid prototyping or large-scale agent deployments. We present GAMMS (Graph based Adversarial Multiagent Modeling Simulator), a lightweight yet extensible simulation framework designed to support fast development and evaluation of agent behavior in environments that can be represented as graphs. GAMMS emphasizes five core objectives: scalability, ease of use, integration-first architecture, fast visualization feedback, and real-world grounding. It enables efficient simulation of complex domains such as urban road networks and communication systems, supports integration with external tools (e.g., machine learning libraries, planning solvers), and provides built-in visualization with minimal configuration. GAMMS is agnostic to policy type, supporting heuristic, optimization-based, and learning-based agents, including those using large language models. By lowering the barrier to entry for researchers and enabling high-performance simulations on standard hardware, GAMMS facilitates experimentation and innovation in multi-agent systems, autonomous planning, and adversarial modeling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show significant bias as evaluators in payment-risk settings, with some models over-scoring and others under-scoring relative to human consensus, though anonymization reduces bias by 25.8%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used to evaluate reasoning quality in financial settings, but their reliability and bias in payments-risk contexts remain poorly understood, creating a need for systematic assessment frameworks.

Method: A structured multi-evaluator framework combining a five-criterion rubric with Monte-Carlo scoring to assess rationale quality and evaluator stability. Five frontier LLMs generate and cross-evaluate MCC risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions, using a consensus-deviation metric to eliminate circularity.

Result: Substantial heterogeneity in LLM bias: GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show negative self-evaluation bias (-0.33, -0.31), while Gemini-2.5 Pro and Grok 4 display positive bias (+0.77, +0.71). Anonymization reduces bias by 25.8%. LLM judges score +0.46 points above human consensus, with GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet aligning better with human judgment. Four models show statistically significant alignment with payment-network data (Spearman rho = 0.56 to 0.77).

Conclusion: The framework provides a replicable basis for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge systems in payment-risk workflows and highlights the need for bias-aware protocols in operational financial settings, as LLM evaluators exhibit systematic biases that affect their reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators of reasoning quality, yet their reliability and bias in payments-risk settings remain poorly understood. We introduce a structured multi-evaluator framework for assessing LLM reasoning in Merchant Category Code (MCC)-based merchant risk assessment, combining a five-criterion rubric with Monte-Carlo scoring to evaluate rationale quality and evaluator stability. Five frontier LLMs generate and cross-evaluate MCC risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions. To establish a judge-independent reference, we introduce a consensus-deviation metric that eliminates circularity by comparing each judge's score to the mean of all other judges, yielding a theoretically grounded measure of self-evaluation and cross-model deviation. Results reveal substantial heterogeneity: GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show negative self-evaluation bias (-0.33, -0.31), while Gemini-2.5 Pro and Grok 4 display positive bias (+0.77, +0.71), with bias attenuating by 25.8 percent under anonymization. Evaluation by 26 payment-industry experts shows LLM judges assign scores averaging +0.46 points above human consensus, and that the negative bias of GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet reflects closer alignment with human judgment. Ground-truth validation using payment-network data shows four models exhibit statistically significant alignment (Spearman rho = 0.56 to 0.77), confirming that the framework captures genuine quality. Overall, the framework provides a replicable basis for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge systems in payment-risk workflows and highlights the need for bias-aware protocols in operational financial settings.

### [342] [Democratic Preference Alignment via Sortition-Weighted RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05113)
*Suvadip Sana,Jinzhou Wu,Martin T. Wells*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Democratic Preference Optimization (DemPO) uses algorithmic sortition (like citizen assemblies) to make AI preference alignment more representative by sampling raters demographically rather than using convenience samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current preference-based AI alignment methods (like RLHF) rely on human rater pools that are convenience samples, systematically over-representing some demographics and under-representing others, leading to biased value alignment.

Method: DemPO introduces two training schemes: 1) Hard Panel - trains exclusively on preferences from a quota-satisfying mini-public sampled via sortition; 2) Soft Panel - retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery. The paper proves Soft Panel weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form.

Result: Using a public preference dataset with rater demographics and a 75-clause constitution from a representative US panel, Llama models (1B to 8B parameters) were fine-tuned. Across six aggregation methods, Hard Panel consistently ranked first, and Soft Panel consistently outperformed unweighted baselines, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increased.

Conclusion: Enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage (via sortition) yields AI models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics, outperforming post-hoc correction approaches.

Abstract: Whose values should AI systems learn? Preference based alignment methods like RLHF derive their training signal from human raters, yet these rater pools are typically convenience samples that systematically over represent some demographics and under represent others. We introduce Democratic Preference Optimization, or DemPO, a framework that applies algorithmic sortition, the same mechanism used to construct citizen assemblies, to preference based fine tuning. DemPO offers two training schemes. Hard Panel trains exclusively on preferences from a quota satisfying mini public sampled via sortition. Soft Panel retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery. We prove that Soft Panel weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form. Using a public preference dataset that pairs human judgments with rater demographics and a seventy five clause constitution independently elicited from a representative United States panel, we evaluate Llama models from one billion to eight billion parameters fine tuned under each scheme. Across six aggregation methods, the Hard Panel consistently ranks first and the Soft Panel consistently outperforms the unweighted baseline, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases. These results demonstrate that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage, rather than post hoc correction, yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics.

*Keyang Xuan,Pengda Wang,Chongrui Ye,Haofei Yu,Tal August,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SocialVeil: A social learning environment that simulates communication barriers (semantic vagueness, sociocultural mismatch, emotional interference) to evaluate LLMs' social intelligence in realistic imperfect settings, showing significant performance degradation and limited effectiveness of adaptation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks assume idealized communication between agents, limiting ability to diagnose whether LLMs can maintain and repair interactions in realistic, imperfect settings with communication barriers.

Method: Created SocialVeil environment based on systematic literature review of human communication challenges, introducing three disruption types: semantic vagueness, sociocultural mismatch, and emotional interference. Developed two barrier-aware metrics: unresolved confusion and mutual understanding. Tested across 720 scenarios with four frontier LLMs, plus human evaluation for fidelity validation.

Result: Communication barriers consistently impair LLM performance: mutual understanding reduced by over 45% on average, confusion elevated by nearly 50%. Human evaluations show high fidelity (ICC≈0.78, Pearson r≈0.80). Adaptation strategies (Repair Instruction and Interactive learning) have only modest effects, far from barrier-free performance.

Conclusion: This work advances social interaction environments toward real-world communication, revealing LLMs' limitations in handling communication barriers and opening opportunities for exploring social intelligence in more realistic settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated in interactive environments to test their social intelligence. However, existing benchmarks often assume idealized communication between agents, limiting our ability to diagnose whether LLMs can maintain and repair interactions in more realistic, imperfect settings. To close this gap, we present \textsc{SocialVeil}, a social learning environment that can simulate social interaction under cognitive-difference-induced communication barriers. Grounded in a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction, \textsc{SocialVeil} introduces three representative types of such disruption, \emph{semantic vagueness}, \emph{sociocultural mismatch}, and \emph{emotional interference}. We also introduce two barrier-aware evaluation metrics, \emph{unresolved confusion} and \emph{mutual understanding}, to evaluate interaction quality under impaired communication. Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs show that barriers consistently impair performance, with mutual understanding reduced by over 45\% on average, and confusion elevated by nearly 50\%. Human evaluations validate the fidelity of these simulated barriers (ICC$\approx$0.78, Pearson r$\approx$0.80). We further demonstrate that adaptation strategies (Repair Instruction and Interactive learning) only have a modest effect far from barrier-free performance. This work takes a step toward bringing social interaction environments closer to real-world communication, opening opportunities for exploring the social intelligence of LLM agents.

*Abdul Joseph Fofanah,Lian Wen,David Chen,Alpha Alimamy Kamara,Zhongyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAST-CKT is a chaos-aware framework for cross-city traffic prediction that uses chaotic analysis to quantify predictability regimes, enabling regime-adaptive temporal modeling, dynamic spatial dependency learning, and cross-city knowledge transfer for few-shot learning.

Conclusion: CAST-CKT effectively addresses cross-city traffic prediction challenges by incorporating chaotic analysis, enabling better few-shot learning, interpretable regime analysis, and uncertainty quantification for practical applications.

Abstract: Traffic prediction in data-scarce, cross-city settings is challenging due to complex nonlinear dynamics and domain shifts. Existing methods often fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature for effective few-shot learning. We propose CAST-CKT, a novel Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer framework. It employs an efficient chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, driving several key innovations: chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modelling; adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer. The framework also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis shows improved generalisation bounds.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HugRAG is a graph-based RAG framework that uses causal gating across hierarchical modules to improve structured retrieval and reasoning by modeling causal relationships and suppressing spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based RAG methods over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful answers. Current causal approaches are limited to local/single-document contexts and suffer from information isolation in modular graph structures, hindering scalability and cross-module reasoning.

Method: HugRAG rethinks knowledge organization through causal gating across hierarchical modules, explicitly modeling causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs.

Result: Extensive experiments show HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: HugRAG establishes a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has enhanced large language models by enabling access to external knowledge, with graph-based RAG emerging as a powerful paradigm for structured retrieval and reasoning. However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Our work establishes a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.

TL;DR: DAKS system improves RAG for Chinese Tibetan medicine by addressing density bias in multi-KB retrieval and enhancing cross-KB evidence coverage through routing, budgeted retrieval, and alignment graph fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain settings with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases (encyclopedia, classics, clinical papers) in Chinese Tibetan medicine present challenges where dense encyclopedia entries dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence, requiring better traceability and cross-KB verification.

Method: Two complementary methods: 1) DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and prioritize authoritative sources, 2) Alignment graph guides evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing to improve cross-KB evidence coverage without naive concatenation, using lightweight generator openPangu-Embedded-7B.

Result: Consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage, with full system achieving best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness on 500-query benchmark covering single-KB and cross-KB questions.

Conclusion: The proposed DAKS system effectively addresses multi-KB RAG challenges in specialized domains like Chinese Tibetan medicine by improving source prioritization and cross-KB evidence integration, enhancing traceability and reducing hallucinations.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) promises grounded question answering, yet domain settings with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases (KBs) remain challenging. In Chinese Tibetan medicine, encyclopedia entries are often dense and easy to match, which can dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence. We study a practical setting with three KBs (encyclopedia, classics, and clinical papers) and a 500-query benchmark (cutoff $K{=}5$) covering both single-KB and cross-KB questions. We propose two complementary methods to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification. First, DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and to prioritize authoritative sources when appropriate. Second, we use an alignment graph to guide evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing, improving cross-KB evidence coverage without relying on naive concatenation. All answers are generated by a lightweight generator, \textsc{openPangu-Embedded-7B}. Experiments show consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage, with the full system achieving the best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness.

TL;DR: Surgery: A fine-tuning defense method that uses attention sink divergence analysis to identify and suppress harmful pattern learning in LLMs, improving safety alignment against harmful fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Harmful fine-tuning can compromise the safety alignment of large language models, creating significant safety risks that need to be addressed.

Method: Proposes Surgery defense: 1) Measures sink divergence statistic for attention heads, 2) Observes two different signs of sink divergence, 3) Finds positive sink divergence increases with model harmfulness, 4) Proposes separable sink divergence hypothesis, 5) Uses regularizer for sink divergence suppression to steer attention heads toward negative divergence group.

Result: Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90% on BeaverTails, 11.25% on HarmBench, and 9.55% on SorryBench benchmarks.

Conclusion: The attention sink mechanism can be effectively utilized to defend against harmful fine-tuning by suppressing attention heads that learn harmful patterns, significantly improving model safety alignment.

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning can invalidate safety alignment of large language models, exposing significant safety risks. In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\%, 11.25\%, and 9.55\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of multiple Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models for brain tumour detection. A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed and trained on the BraTS 2021 dataset, achieving 91.24% accuracy in distinguishing between tumour and non-tumour regions. This research combines Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GRAD-CAM), Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide comprehensive insights into the model's decision-making process. This multi-technique approach successfully identified both full and partial tumours, offering layered explanations ranging from broad regions of interest to pixel-level details. GRAD-CAM highlighted important spatial regions, LRP provided detailed pixel-level relevance and SHAP quantified feature contributions. The integrated approach effectively explained model predictions, including cases with partial tumour visibility thus showing superior explanatory power compared to individual XAI methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TEA: A dynamic in-situ task generation method for embodied agents that creates tasks in unseen 3D environments through interaction-evolution cycles, revealing significant gaps in current models' real-world capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks suffer from data contamination and lack scene specificity, making them inadequate for evaluating agents in unseen real-world environments where general intelligent agents will be deployed.

Method: Two-stage interaction-evolution system: 1) Interaction stage where agents actively interact with environments, creating a loop between task execution and generation; 2) Evolution stage using task graph modeling to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data.

Result: TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks across 10 unseen scenes in two cycles, with human verification confirming physical reasonableness and coverage of essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking revealed SOTA models perform poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness, and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning.

Conclusion: In-situ evaluation is necessary before deploying agents into real-world human environments, as current models despite excelling on public benchmarks show significant deficiencies in real-world settings.

Abstract: As general intelligent agents are poised for widespread deployment in diverse households, evaluation tailored to each unique unseen 3D environment has become a critical prerequisite. However, existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings. To address this, we propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition. We define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA). In the interaction stage, the agent actively interacts with the environment, creating a loop between task execution and generation that allows for continuous task generation. In the evolution stage, task graph modeling allows us to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data. Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on our in-situ tasks reveals that models, despite excelling on public benchmarks, perform surprisingly poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning. These sobering findings highlight the necessity of in-situ evaluation before deploying agents into real-world human environments.

### [351] [Beyond Cosine Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05266)
*Xinbo Ai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces recos, a new similarity metric that outperforms cosine similarity by using a tighter upper bound on dot products and normalizing by sorted vector components, capturing nonlinear semantic relationships better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cosine similarity is limited to capturing linear relationships due to its mathematical grounding in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which fails to model the complex, nonlinear structures of real-world semantic spaces. There's a need for a better similarity metric that can capture more complex semantic relationships.

Method: The authors derive a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound, leading to recos - a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. This relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance.

Result: Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models (static, contextualized, and universal types) show that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks.

Conclusion: recos is established as a mathematically principled and empirically superior alternative to cosine similarity, offering enhanced accuracy for semantic analysis in complex embedding spaces by capturing broader classes of relationships beyond linear dependencies.

Abstract: Cosine similarity, the standard metric for measuring semantic similarity in vector spaces, is mathematically grounded in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which inherently limits it to capturing linear relationships--a constraint that fails to model the complex, nonlinear structures of real-world semantic spaces. We advance this theoretical underpinning by deriving a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound. This new bound leads directly to recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. recos relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance, thereby capturing a broader class of relationships. Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models--spanning static, contextualized, and universal types--demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks. Our work establishes recos as a mathematically principled and empirically superior alternative, offering enhanced accuracy for semantic analysis in complex embedding spaces.

*Kim Hammar,Tansu Alpcan,Emil Lupu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework that integrates LLMs in a security management loop with consistency checking and feedback refinement to control hallucinations and improve incident response planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise for security management tasks like incident response planning, but their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate present significant challenges that need to be addressed.

Method: An iterative framework where LLMs generate candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, the system abstains and collects external feedback (e.g., from digital twins), then refines actions through in-context learning.

Result: The framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs in incident response experiments on four public datasets, with theoretical guarantees on hallucination control and regret bounds.

Conclusion: The proposed principled framework effectively addresses LLM hallucinations in security management by integrating consistency checking and feedback refinement, providing both practical improvements and theoretical guarantees for reliable decision support.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are promising tools for supporting security management tasks, such as incident response planning. However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs. Experiments on four public datasets show that our framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs.

*Xilin Dai,Wanxu Cai,Zhijian Xu,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that universal foundation models for time series are fundamentally flawed due to incompatible generative processes across domains, and proposes replacing them with causal control agents that orchestrate specialized solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to challenge the prevailing approach of building universal foundation models for time series, which the authors believe is based on a category error - mistaking time series as a semantic modality rather than a structural container. They argue that different time series domains (finance, fluid dynamics, etc.) have incompatible generative processes, making universal models ineffective.

Method: The paper introduces the "Autoregressive Blindness Bound" - a theoretical limit showing that history-only models cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts. They propose a "Causal Control Agent" paradigm where an agent uses external context to orchestrate a hierarchy of specialized solvers, including frozen domain experts and lightweight Just-in-Time adaptors.

Result: Theoretical result showing the fundamental limitation of autoregressive models for predicting regime shifts. The proposed Causal Control Agent framework provides an alternative architecture that can better handle distributional drift by leveraging external context and specialized solvers.

Conclusion: The paper calls for a paradigm shift from pursuing universal foundation models to building causal control systems, and recommends changing benchmarks from "Zero-Shot Accuracy" to "Drift Adaptation Speed" to prioritize robust, control-theoretic systems that can handle real-world distributional changes.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the pursuit of "Universal Foundation Models for Time Series" rests on a fundamental category error, mistaking a structural Container for a semantic Modality. We contend that because time series hold incompatible generative processes (e.g., finance vs. fluid dynamics), monolithic models degenerate into expensive "Generic Filters" that fail to generalize under distributional drift. To address this, we introduce the "Autoregressive Blindness Bound," a theoretical limit proving that history-only models cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts. We advocate replacing universality with a Causal Control Agent paradigm, where an agent leverages external context to orchestrate a hierarchy of specialized solvers, from frozen domain experts to lightweight Just-in-Time adaptors. We conclude by calling for a shift in benchmarks from "Zero-Shot Accuracy" to "Drift Adaptation Speed" to prioritize robust, control-theoretic systems.

*Seongyeub Chu,Jongwoo Kim,Mun Yong Yi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AMR is a novel aspect-aware MOOC recommendation framework that automatically discovers metapaths and models path-specific multiple aspects using semantic node embeddings, outperforming traditional graph-based methods that rely on manually predefined metapaths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MOOC recommendation methods (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering) suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization. Existing graph-based approaches still rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which capture only superficial structural relationships and impose substantial burdens on domain experts and engineering costs.

Method: AMR automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding semantic content of nodes within each metapath, derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder, and incorporates these representations as edge features in learner-learner and KC-KC subgraphs for fine-grained semantically informed recommendations.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale MOOCCube and PEEK datasets show AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics (HR@K and nDCG@K). Further analysis confirms AMR effectively captures rich path-specific aspect information for more accurate recommendations.

Conclusion: AMR overcomes limitations of traditional methods by automatically discovering metapaths and modeling semantic aspects, providing a more effective framework for MOOC recommendation that doesn't rely on manually predefined metapaths while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: MOOC recommendation systems have received increasing attention to help learners navigate and select preferred learning content. Traditional methods such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization. To alleviate these limitations, graph-based approaches have been proposed; however, they still rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which often capture only superficial structural relationships and impose substantial burdens on domain experts as well as significant engineering costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose AMR (Aspect-aware MOOC Recommendation), a novel framework that models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath. AMR automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder, and incorporates these representations as edge features in the learner-learner and KC-KC subgraphs to achieve fine-grained semantically informed KC recommendations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale MOOCCube and PEEK datasets show that AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics such as HR@K and nDCG@K. Further analysis confirms that AMR effectively captures rich path-specific aspect information, allowing more accurate recommendations than those methods that rely solely on predefined metapaths. The code will be available upon accepted.

TL;DR: GPT-5 matches or outperforms business school students in negotiation tasks, showing AGI-level performance, but with remaining robustness and trustworthiness challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' negotiation capabilities, a central business task requiring strategic reasoning, theory of mind, and economic value creation, using realistic scenarios from MBA courses.

Method: Introduced PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark with multi-agent interactions over realistic scenarios from an elite business school MBA negotiation course, comparing LLMs against trained business students.

Result: GPT-5 matches or outperforms business school students despite their semester of instruction and targeted coaching. Joint-intentionality scaffolding helps mid/lower-tier LMs more than frontier models. Multi-dimensional behavioral profiles reveal cross-model heterogeneity in deception, computation accuracy, instruction compliance, and reputation.

Conclusion: Frontier language agents are intellectually and psychologically capable for high-stakes economic deployment, but deficiencies in robustness and trustworthiness remain open challenges.

Abstract: We present an in-depth evaluation of LLMs' ability to negotiate, a central business task that requires strategic reasoning, theory of mind, and economic value creation. To do so, we introduce PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark grounded in multi-agent interactions over realistic scenarios drawn from an MBA negotiation course at an elite business school. We find systematic evidence of AGI-level performance in which a representative frontier agent (GPT-5) matches or outperforms trained business-school students, despite a semester of general negotiation instruction and targeted coaching immediately prior to the task. We further study the effects of joint-intentionality agentic scaffolding and find asymmetric gains, with large improvements for mid- and lower-tier LMs and diminishing returns for frontier LMs. Beyond deal outcomes, PieArena provides a multi-dimensional negotiation behavioral profile, revealing novel cross-model heterogeneity, masked by deal-outcome-only benchmarks, in deception, computation accuracy, instruction compliance, and perceived reputation. Overall, our results suggest that frontier language agents are already intellectually and psychologically capable of deployment in high-stakes economic settings, but deficiencies in robustness and trustworthiness remain open challenges.

TL;DR: ProAct is a framework that trains LLM agents for long-horizon planning by internalizing lookahead reasoning through supervised fine-tuning on search-derived trajectories and enhancing policy optimization with a Monte-Carlo critic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents struggle with long-horizon planning in interactive environments due to compounding errors when simulating future states, which limits their planning accuracy and generalization capabilities.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD) - supervised fine-tuning on trajectories from environment-based search, compressing search trees into causal reasoning chains; 2) Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic) - plug-and-play value estimator using lightweight environment rollouts to enhance policy-gradient algorithms like PPO/GRPO.

Result: ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy in both stochastic (2048) and deterministic (Sokoban) environments. A 4B parameter model outperforms all open-source baselines and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source models, with robust generalization to unseen environments.

Conclusion: ProAct effectively addresses long-horizon planning challenges by enabling agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning through efficient training methods, achieving strong performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agents struggle in interactive environments requiring long-horizon planning, primarily due to compounding errors when simulating future states. To address this, we propose ProAct, a framework that enables agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning through a two-stage training paradigm. First, we introduce Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD), where the agent undergoes supervised fine-tuning on trajectories derived from environment-based search. By compressing complex search trees into concise, causal reasoning chains, the agent learns the logic of foresight without the computational overhead of inference-time search. Second, to further refine decision accuracy, we propose the Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic), a plug-and-play auxiliary value estimator designed to enhance policy-gradient algorithms like PPO and GRPO. By leveraging lightweight environment rollouts to calibrate value estimates, MC-Critic provides a low-variance signal that facilitates stable policy optimization without relying on expensive model-based value approximation. Experiments on both stochastic (e.g., 2048) and deterministic (e.g., Sokoban) environments demonstrate that ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy. Notably, a 4B parameter model trained with ProAct outperforms all open-source baselines and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source models, while demonstrating robust generalization to unseen environments.

TL;DR: AgentXRay reconstructs interpretable workflows from black-box agentic systems using only input-output access, employing Monte Carlo Tree Search with pruning to efficiently explore the workflow space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models enable complex problem solving but create opaque agentic systems that are difficult to interpret and control. Current frameworks lack transparency, making deployed systems operate as black boxes to users.

Method: Introduces Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR) task and AgentXRay framework that formulates AWR as combinatorial optimization over discrete agent roles and tool invocations. Uses Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by Red-Black Pruning mechanism to navigate vast search space, integrating proxy quality with search depth.

Result: AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration under fixed iteration budgets across diverse domains.

Conclusion: AgentXRay successfully reconstructs editable white-box workflows that approximate black-box systems without accessing model parameters, improving interpretability and control of agentic systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown strong capabilities in complex problem solving, yet many agentic systems remain difficult to interpret and control due to opaque internal workflows. While some frameworks offer explicit architectures for collaboration, many deployed agentic systems operate as black boxes to users. We address this by introducing Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR), a new task aiming to synthesize an explicit, interpretable stand-in workflow that approximates a black-box system using only input--output access. We propose AgentXRay, a search-based framework that formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem over discrete agent roles and tool invocations in a chain-structured workflow space. Unlike model distillation, AgentXRay produces editable white-box workflows that match target outputs under an observable, output-based proxy metric, without accessing model parameters. To navigate the vast search space, AgentXRay employs Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by a scoring-based Red-Black Pruning mechanism, which dynamically integrates proxy quality with search depth. Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration under fixed iteration budgets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PATHWAYS benchmark reveals web agents struggle with multi-step decision tasks requiring discovery and integration of hidden contextual information, showing limitations in adaptive investigation and evidence integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether web-based agents can effectively discover and use hidden contextual information in multi-step decision tasks, testing their ability to go beyond surface-level signals and perform adaptive investigation.

Method: Created PATHWAYS benchmark with 250 multi-step decision tasks requiring discovery of hidden contextual information. Tested both closed and open models, analyzing performance across tasks that require overturning misleading surface-level signals. Also experimented with providing more explicit instructions to agents.

Result: Agents typically navigate to relevant pages but retrieve decisive hidden evidence in only a small fraction of cases. Performance drops sharply to near chance when tasks require overturning misleading surface-level signals. Agents frequently hallucinate investigative reasoning and fail to integrate discovered context into final decisions. Explicit instructions improve context discovery but often reduce overall accuracy, revealing a tradeoff between procedural compliance and effective judgement.

Conclusion: Current web agent architectures lack reliable mechanisms for adaptive investigation, evidence integration, and judgement override, highlighting fundamental limitations in how these systems handle complex decision-making requiring discovery and use of hidden contextual information.

Abstract: We introduce PATHWAYS, a benchmark of 250 multi-step decision tasks that test whether web-based agents can discover and correctly use hidden contextual information. Across both closed and open models, agents typically navigate to relevant pages but retrieve decisive hidden evidence in only a small fraction of cases. When tasks require overturning misleading surface-level signals, performance drops sharply to near chance accuracy. Agents frequently hallucinate investigative reasoning by claiming to rely on evidence they never accessed. Even when correct context is discovered, agents often fail to integrate it into their final decision. Providing more explicit instructions improves context discovery but often reduces overall accuracy, revealing a tradeoff between procedural compliance and effective judgement. Together, these results show that current web agent architectures lack reliable mechanisms for adaptive investigation, evidence integration, and judgement override.

*Youngcheon You,Banseok Lee,Minseop Choi,Seonyoung Kim,Hyochan Chong,Changdong Kim,Youngmin Kim,Dongkyu Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RaBiT is a novel 2-bit quantization framework that resolves feature co-adaptation in residual binarization by enforcing a residual hierarchy, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 4.49× inference speed-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme quantization of LLMs creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance. Residual binarization enables matmul-free inference but suffers from pathological feature co-adaptation where parallel binary paths learn redundant features, degrading error compensation and limiting model capacity.

Method: RaBiT resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. It sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, ensuring each path corrects the error of the preceding one. The method uses robust initialization prioritizing functional preservation over weight approximation.

Result: RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier, achieving state-of-the-art performance, rivaling hardware-intensive Vector Quantization methods, and delivering 4.49× inference speed-up over full-precision models on RTX 4090.

Conclusion: RaBiT successfully addresses the feature co-adaptation problem in residual binarization through algorithmic residual hierarchy enforcement, enabling efficient 2-bit quantization without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) requires extreme quantization, forcing a critical trade-off between low-bit efficiency and performance. Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.

TL;DR: Evaluation of four small medical LLMs (Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, MedLLaMA3-v20) on ophthalmology patient queries shows Meerkat-7B performs best while MedLLaMA3-v20 has concerning hallucination rates; GPT-4-Turbo evaluation aligns well with clinician assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain-specific LLMs are increasingly used in ophthalmology for patient education, triage, and clinical decision making, making rigorous evaluation essential to ensure safety and accuracy in clinical applications.

Method: Cross-sectional study with 180 ophthalmology patient queries answered by four small medical LLMs (under 10B parameters), generating 2160 responses. Evaluated by three ophthalmologists of different seniority and GPT-4-Turbo using S.C.O.R.E. framework (Safety, Consensus, Objectivity, Reproducibility, Explainability) on 5-point Likert scale. Agreement analyzed using Spearman correlation, Kendall tau, and kernel density estimates.

Result: Meerkat-7B performed best with mean scores: 3.44 (Senior Consultants), 4.08 (Consultants), 4.18 (Residents). MedLLaMA3-v20 performed worst with 25.5% responses containing hallucinations or clinically misleading content. GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinicians (Spearman rho=0.80, Kendall tau=0.67), though Senior Consultants graded more conservatively.

Conclusion: Medical LLMs show potential for safe ophthalmic question answering but have gaps in clinical depth and consensus. LLM-based evaluation is feasible for large-scale benchmarking, but hybrid automated-clinician review frameworks are needed for safe clinical deployment.

Abstract: Domain specific large language models are increasingly used to support patient education, triage, and clinical decision making in ophthalmology, making rigorous evaluation essential to ensure safety and accuracy. This study evaluated four small medical LLMs Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20 in answering ophthalmology related patient queries and assessed the feasibility of LLM based evaluation against clinician grading. In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents. MedLLaMA3-v20 performed poorest, with 25.5 percent of responses containing hallucinations or clinically misleading content, including fabricated terminology. GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinician assessments overall, with Spearman rho of 0.80 and Kendall tau of 0.67, though Senior Consultants graded more conservatively. Overall, medical LLMs demonstrated potential for safe ophthalmic question answering, but gaps remained in clinical depth and consensus, supporting the feasibility of LLM based evaluation for large scale benchmarking and the need for hybrid automated and clinician review frameworks to guide safe clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing opinion dynamics methods lack comprehensive physical systems and struggle to integrate dynamics from local, global, and endogenous levels. Current approaches use penalty-based constraints that fail to deeply encode physical priors, leading to optimization issues and poor alignment between latent representations and physical transparency.

Method: Proposes OPINN framework that interprets opinion dynamics via Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory. Builds on Neural ODEs to coordinate neural networks with physical priors, creating a physics-informed neural framework for opinion modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting on both real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: OPINN offers a promising paradigm for integrating cyber, physical, and social systems, synergizing mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility for better opinion dynamics modeling.

Abstract: Advanced opinion dynamics modeling is vital for deciphering social behavior, emphasizing its role in mitigating polarization and securing cyberspace. To synergize mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility, recent studies have explored the integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for opinion modeling. Despite this promise, existing methods are tailored to incomplete priors, lacking a comprehensive physical system to integrate dynamics from local, global, and endogenous levels. Moreover, penalty-based constraints adopted in existing methods struggle to deeply encode physical priors, leading to optimization pathologies and discrepancy between latent representations and physical transparency. To this end, we offer a physical view to interpret opinion dynamics via Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory. Building upon the Neural ODEs, we define the neural opinion dynamics to coordinate neural networks with physical priors, and further present the OPINN, a physics-informed neural framework for opinion dynamics modeling. Evaluated on real-world and synthetic datasets, OPINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting, offering a promising paradigm for the nexus of cyber, physical, and social systems.

### [363] [THOR: Inductive Link Prediction over Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05424)
*Weijian Yu,Yuhuan Lu,Dingqi Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: THOR is an inductive link prediction method for hyper-relational knowledge graphs that learns transferable structural patterns across different vocabularies, outperforming existing techniques by significant margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hyper-relational KG link prediction methods are mostly transductive - they learn from specific KG vocabularies and can only predict within those same vocabularies, limiting generalizability to unseen entities and relations.

Method: THOR introduces relation and entity foundation graphs to model fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, then uses two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder for efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference.

Result: THOR outperforms baselines on 12 datasets, achieving 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques respectively.

Conclusion: THOR successfully captures structural invariance transferable across HKGs for inductive link prediction, demonstrating strong performance improvements over existing methods in fully-inductive settings.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a key ingredient supporting a variety of applications. Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings. Results show that THOR outperforms a sizable collection of baselines, yielding 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively. A series of ablation studies also reveals our key design factors capturing the structural invariance transferable across HKGs for inductive tasks.

Method: Proposes M²-Miner framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search with three collaborative agents: InferAgent (guidance), OrchestraAgent (acceleration), and JudgeAgent (evaluation). Includes intent recycling strategy to extract additional interaction trajectories and progressive model-in-the-loop training to improve mining success rate.

Result: GUI agents fine-tuned using the mined data achieve state-of-the-art performance on several mobile GUI benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the automated data mining approach.

Conclusion: M²-Miner provides a scalable, low-cost solution for generating high-quality GUI agent training data, addressing key challenges in data collection and enabling advancement of intelligent human-computer interaction systems.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent is pivotal to advancing intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms. Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks. Our work will be released to facilitate the community research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electricity price forecasting is crucial for energy market stakeholders but challenging due to volatility and nonlinearity. Traditional statistical and DL models struggle with complex temporal dependencies and heterogeneous data integration. While TSFMs show promise in general time series tasks, their effectiveness in volatile day-ahead EPF remains underexplored.

Method: Proposes spike regularization strategy and evaluates multiple TSFMs (TTMs, MOIRAI, MOMENT, TimesFM) against traditional models (ARIMA, LSTM, CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly Singapore wholesale market data with volatile trends. Incorporates exogenous factors like weather and calendar variables where applicable.

Result: TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings.

Conclusion: TSFMs offer superior performance for volatile electricity price forecasting, providing practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in energy markets.

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting (EPF) is essential for energy markets stakeholders (e.g. grid operators, energy traders, policymakers) but remains challenging due to the inherent volatility and nonlinearity of price signals. Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore. Exogenous factors (e.g. weather and calendar variables) are also incorporated into models where applicable. Results demonstrate that TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings. The findings offer practical guidance for improving forecast accuracy and decision-making in volatile electricity markets.

Motivation: Existing conditional representation learning methods that project features onto LLM-generated text bases suffer from two key limitations: sensitivity to the subspace basis selection and vulnerability to interference between different semantic subspaces, which degrades performance.

Method: Proposes OD-CRL framework with two components: 1) Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) that constructs orthogonal semantic bases using singular value decomposition with curvature-based truncation, and 2) Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP) that suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces.

Result: Extensive experiments across customized clustering, classification, and retrieval tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: OD-CRL effectively addresses the limitations of existing conditional representation learning methods by optimizing orthogonal bases and suppressing subspace interference, achieving improved performance across diverse customized tasks.

Abstract: Conditional representation learning aims to extract criterion-specific features for customized tasks. Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). Specifically, AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with a curvature-based truncation. NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces. Extensive experiments conducted across customized clustering, customized classification, and customized retrieval tasks demonstrate that OD-CRL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization.

TL;DR: ALIVE is a hands-free alignment framework that uses adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback to help LLMs internalize reasoning principles, overcoming limitations of traditional scalar reward-based RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL for LLMs relies on costly, brittle, and logic-blind scalar rewards that prevent models from developing deep understanding of reasoning principles, creating a "reward bottleneck" that hampers expert-level reasoning development.

Method: ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model using adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback. It enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, transforming external critiques into endogenous reasoning faculties.

Result: ALIVE achieves accuracy gains, improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and logical inference benchmarks, using identical data and compute compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: ALIVE provides a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human supervision, fostering self-sustaining capability growth through its reasoning trinity approach.

Abstract: The quest for expert-level reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hampered by a persistent \textit{reward bottleneck}: traditional reinforcement learning (RL) relies on scalar rewards that are \textbf{costly} to scale, \textbf{brittle} across domains, and \textbf{blind} to the underlying logic of a solution. This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \textbf{ALIVE} (\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates. These results indicate that the reasoning trinity fosters a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth, positioning ALIVE as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human-in-the-loop supervision.

TL;DR: Phi-former is a hierarchical interaction representation learning method that models compound-protein interactions across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels to better reflect biological recognition patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for compound-protein interactions (CPIs) operate at atomic level but don't align with chemical realities where molecular fragments (motifs/functional groups) are the primary units of biological recognition and binding.

Method: Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and uses pairwise pre-training to model interactions systematically across three levels: atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif. It employs intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial.

Result: Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks and accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations.

Conclusion: The method's insights may guide rational drug design and support precision medicine applications by better reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners.

Abstract: Drug discovery remains time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, often requiring years and substantial investment per drug candidate. Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that our method accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations. These insights may guide rational drug design and support precision medicine applications.

*Hanyu Wei,Zunhai Su,Peng Lu,Chao Li,Spandan Tiwari,Ashish Sirasao,Yuhan Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SDFP is a training-free speculative decoding framework that accelerates LLMs by pruning low-impact layers using Fisher Information Trace to create draft models, achieving 1.32x-1.5x speedup without changing output distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are crucial for multimedia applications but suffer from high latency due to autoregressive decoding. Existing speculative decoding methods require costly draft model acquisition, training, or maintenance, limiting deployment.

Method: SDFP uses Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning to remove low-impact layers from the original LLM, creating a compact draft model. This is training-free, plug-and-play, and preserves compatibility for speculative verification.

Result: Achieves 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup across benchmarks without altering the target model's output distribution, enabling low-latency multimedia applications.

Conclusion: SDFP provides a practical, deployment-friendly solution for accelerating LLMs through training-free draft construction, addressing the cost and complexity limitations of existing speculative decoding approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) underpin interactive multimedia applications such as captioning, retrieval, recommendation, and creative content generation, yet their autoregressive decoding incurs substantial latency. Speculative decoding reduces latency using a lightweight draft model, but deployment is often limited by the cost and complexity of acquiring, tuning, and maintaining an effective draft model. Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization. We propose SDFP, a fully training-free and plug-and-play framework that builds the draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM. Using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, SDFP removes low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model for standard speculative verification. SDFP needs no additional training, hyperparameter tuning, or separately maintained drafts, enabling rapid, deployment-friendly draft construction. Across benchmarks, SDFP delivers 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup without altering the target model's output distribution, supporting low-latency multimedia applications.

*Ajo Babu George,Anna Mariam John,Athul Anoop,Balu Bhasuran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: New multimodal dataset and AI model for ameloblastoma diagnosis with improved classification accuracy from 46.2% to 65.9% and tissue detection F1-score from 43.0% to 90.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI resources for maxillofacial pathology lack comprehensive ameloblastoma coverage and consistent format needed for direct model training, limiting personalized diagnostic support.

Method: Created curated multimodal dataset with radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images plus structured case report data. Used NLP for feature extraction, domain-specific preprocessing/augmentation, and developed multimodal deep learning model for variant classification, recurrence risk assessment, and surgical planning.

Result: Significant performance improvements: variant classification accuracy increased from 46.2% to 65.9%, abnormal tissue detection F1-score improved from 43.0% to 90.3%. Model accepts clinical inputs (complaint, age, gender) for personalized inference.

Conclusion: This work advances patient-specific decision support by providing both a robust multimodal dataset and adaptable AI framework that outperforms existing resources like MultiCaRe for ameloblastoma diagnosis.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled diagnostics in maxillofacial pathology require structured, high-quality multimodal datasets. However, existing resources provide limited ameloblastoma coverage and lack the format consistency needed for direct model training. We present a newly curated multimodal dataset specifically focused on ameloblastoma, integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data derived from case reports. Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning. The model is designed to accept clinical inputs such as presenting complaint, age, and gender during deployment to enhance personalized inference. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated substantial improvements; variant classification accuracy increased from 46.2 percent to 65.9 percent, and abnormal tissue detection F1-score improved from 43.0 percent to 90.3 percent. Benchmarked against resources like MultiCaRe, this work advances patient-specific decision support by providing both a robust dataset and an adaptable multimodal AI framework.

*Christopher A. McClurg,Alan R. Wagner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Researchers developed a data-driven simulator to evaluate school security interventions using VR data, enabling scalable testing of robot-based shooter strategies without needing new human participants for each condition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR is effective for evaluating school security measures but requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult, especially for learning effective intervention strategies that need many training episodes.

Method: Developed a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies, then used it to examine robot-based shooter intervention strategies.

Result: The simulator reproduces key empirical patterns from VR studies and enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that would be infeasible to train directly with human subjects.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions, bridging VR experiments with computational simulation.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating school security measures in high-risk scenarios such as school shootings, offering experimental control and high behavioral fidelity. However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects. Overall, this work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPT introduces a method to detect misaligned LLMs by fine-tuning a separate "honest persona" that reviews the main model's responses, achieving 96% accuracy on a benchmark where standard methods fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current auditing techniques fail to detect misaligned LLMs because models can conceal misbehavior during training, and existing methods (black-box and mechanistic interpretability) don't scale with model capabilities.

Method: Split Personality Training (SPT) fine-tunes a second "honest persona" into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation. After the main model responds, the LoRA adapter is activated with a trigger string, allowing the honest persona to review the response while accessing the main model's latent states.

Result: SPT achieves 96% overall accuracy on the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism benchmark, where standard methods report near 0% accuracy. The honest persona reveals latent knowledge inaccessible to external observers, such as fictional biases the compromised model was trained on.

Conclusion: SPT provides an effective approach for detecting misaligned LLMs by creating an internal auditing mechanism that can access the model's latent knowledge, overcoming limitations of current auditing techniques.

Abstract: Detecting misalignment in large language models is challenging because models may learn to conceal misbehavior during training. Standard auditing techniques fall short: black-box methods often cannot distinguish misaligned outputs from benign ones, and mechanistic interpretability does not scale with model capabilities. We introduce Split Personality Training (SPT), which fine-tunes a second ``honest persona'' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation. After the main model responds, we activate the LoRA adapter and insert a trigger string, enabling the honest persona to review the response while accessing the main model's latent states. We test our method on the Anthropic Auditing Game Model Organism, a benchmark where Llama-3.3-70B is trained to exploit reward hacks while concealing this behavior. SPT achieves 96% overall accuracy, whereas Anthropic reports near 0% accuracy. The honest persona reveals latent knowledge inaccessible to external observers, such as the fictional biases the compromised model was trained on.

TL;DR: A principled conditional diffusion guidance framework using Doob's h-transform and martingale theory to enforce hard constraints with probability one, without modifying pretrained score networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety-critical applications and rare-event simulation where soft/reward-based guidance methods offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction. Need for methods that can enforce hard constraints (prescribed events with probability one) in diffusion models.

Method: Develop conditional diffusion guidance based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation, and quadratic variation process. Augments pretrained diffusion with explicit drift correction using logarithmic gradient of conditioning function. Proposes two off-policy learning algorithms: martingale loss and martingale-covariation loss to estimate h and its gradient using only trajectories from pretrained model.

Result: Provides non-asymptotic guarantees for conditional sampler in total variation and Wasserstein distances, explicitly characterizing impact of score approximation and guidance estimation errors. Numerical experiments demonstrate effectiveness in enforcing hard constraints and generating rare-event samples.

Conclusion: Proposes a principled framework for conditional generation under hard constraints with theoretical guarantees, enabling safety-critical applications and rare-event simulation where constraint satisfaction is essential.

Abstract: We study conditional generation in diffusion models under hard constraints, where generated samples must satisfy prescribed events with probability one. Such constraints arise naturally in safety-critical applications and in rare-event simulation, where soft or reward-based guidance methods offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction. Building on a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models, we develop a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation and quadratic variation process. Specifically, the resulting guided dynamics augment a pretrained diffusion with an explicit drift correction involving the logarithmic gradient of a conditioning function, without modifying the pretrained score network. Leveraging martingale and quadratic-variation identities, we propose two novel off-policy learning algorithms based on a martingale loss and a martingale-covariation loss to estimate h and its gradient using only trajectories from the pretrained model. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees for the resulting conditional sampler in both total variation and Wasserstein distances, explicitly characterizing the impact of score approximation and guidance estimation errors. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in enforcing hard constraints and generating rare-event samples.

TL;DR: RGCF-XRec is a hybrid framework that integrates reasoning-guided collaborative filtering knowledge into LLMs for explainable sequential recommendations in one step, improving performance and reducing cold-start gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based recommendation systems overlook collaborative signals and treat recommendation and explanation as separate tasks, creating memory inefficiencies and suboptimal performance.

Method: Introduces reasoning-guided collaborative filtering augmentation through contextual prompting, an efficient scoring mechanism (coherence, completeness, relevance, consistency), and a unified representation learning network that encodes collaborative and semantic signals for structured LLM prompting.

Result: Consistent improvements across Amazon datasets: HR@10 improved by 7.38% in Sports and 4.59% in Toys; ROUGE-L improved by 8.02% and 3.49%; reduced cold-warm performance gap with 14.5% gains in cold-start and 11.9% in warm start; enhanced zero-shot HR@5 by 18.54% in Beauty and 23.16% in Toys.

Conclusion: RGCF-XRec effectively integrates collaborative filtering knowledge with LLMs for explainable sequential recommendations, demonstrating superior performance, generalization, robustness, and training efficiency with a lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B backbone for real-world scalability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit potential for explainable recommendation systems but overlook collaborative signals, while prevailing methods treat recommendation and explanation as separate tasks, resulting in a memory footprint. We present RGCF-XRec, a hybrid framework that introduces reasoning-guided collaborative filtering (CF) knowledge into a language model to deliver explainable sequential recommendations in a single step. Theoretical grounding and empirical findings reveal that RGCF-XRec offers three key merits over leading CF-aware LLM-based methods: (1) reasoning-guided augmentation of CF knowledge through contextual prompting to discover latent preferences and interpretable reasoning paths; (2) an efficient scoring mechanism based on four dimensions: coherence, completeness, relevance, and consistency to mitigate noisy CF reasoning traces and retain high-quality explanations; (3) a unified representation learning network that encodes collaborative and semantic signals, enabling a structured prompt to condition the LLM for explainable sequential recommendation. RGCF-XRec demonstrates consistent improvements across Amazon datasets, Sports, Toys, and Beauty, comprising 642,503 user-item interactions. It improves HR@10 by 7.38\% in Sports and 4.59\% in Toys, along with ROUGE-L by 8.02\% and 3.49\%, respectively. It reduces the cold warm performance gap, achieving overall gains of 14.5\% in cold-start and 11.9\% in warm start scenarios, and enhances zero-shot HR@5 by 18.54\% in Beauty and 23.16\% in Toys, highlighting effective generalization and robustness. Moreover, RGCF-XRec achieves training efficiency with a lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B backbone, ensuring scalability for real-world applications.

*Yikun Zong,Cheston Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VLMs fail at Tangram puzzles (IoU 0.41 single-piece, 0.23 two-piece), but a test-time self-refinement framework with ICL and reward feedback improves performance from 0.63 to 0.932 IoU without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans excel at spatial reasoning through mental rotation and iterative refinement, but VLMs systematically fail at continuous geometric reasoning tasks like Tangram puzzles. The paper addresses whether models can iteratively refine predictions at test time without parameter updates.

Method: A training-free test-time self-refinement framework combining in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops. Uses a verifier-refiner agent with recursive refinement loops that iteratively self-refine predictions based on geometric consistency feedback.

Result: VLMs perform poorly on Tangram tasks (average IoU 0.41 single-piece, 0.23 two-piece). The self-refinement framework improves IoU from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without model retraining, demonstrating substantial enhancement in geometric reasoning.

Conclusion: Incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms through ICL and reward loops can substantially enhance geometric reasoning in VLMs, moving self-improving AI from promise to practice in continuous spatial domains.

Abstract: Humans excel at spatial reasoning tasks like Tangram puzzle assembly through cognitive processes involving mental rotation, iterative refinement, and visual feedback. Inspired by how humans solve Tangram puzzles through trial-and-error, observation, and correction, we design a framework that models these human cognitive mechanisms. However, comprehensive experiments across five representative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) reveal systematic failures in continuous geometric reasoning: average IoU of only 0.41 on single-piece tasks, dropping to 0.23 on two-piece composition, far below human performance where children can complete Tangram tasks successfully. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in self-improving AI: can models iteratively refine their predictions at test time without parameter updates? We introduce a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops, inspired by human cognitive processes. Our training-free verifier-refiner agent applies recursive refinement loops that iteratively self-refine predictions based on geometric consistency feedback, achieving IoU improvements from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without any model retraining. This demonstrates that incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms through ICL and reward loops can substantially enhance geometric reasoning in VLMs, moving self-improving AI from promise to practice in continuous spatial domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can predict cognitive biases at the individual level and emulate the dynamics of biased human behavior when contextual factors like cognitive load interact with these biases, beyond just reproducing well-known biases.

Method: Adapted three well-established decision scenarios into conversational settings, conducted human experiment (N=1100) with chatbot facilitating decision-making through simple/complex dialogues, then used participant demographics and dialogue transcripts to simulate conditions with GPT-4 and GPT-5 LLMs.

Result: Human experiment revealed robust biases, and LLMs reproduced human biases with precision. Notable differences were found between models in how they aligned with human behavior.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively emulate human decision-making biases in interactive contexts, with important implications for designing and evaluating adaptive, bias-aware LLM-based AI systems.

Abstract: Cognitive biases often shape human decisions. While large language models (LLMs) have been shown to reproduce well-known biases, a more critical question is whether LLMs can predict biases at the individual level and emulate the dynamics of biased human behavior when contextual factors, such as cognitive load, interact with these biases. We adapted three well-established decision scenarios into a conversational setting and conducted a human experiment (N=1100). Participants engaged with a chatbot that facilitates decision-making through simple or complex dialogues. Results revealed robust biases. To evaluate how LLMs emulate human decision-making under similar interactive conditions, we used participant demographics and dialogue transcripts to simulate these conditions with LLMs based on GPT-4 and GPT-5. The LLMs reproduced human biases with precision. We found notable differences between models in how they aligned human behavior. This has important implications for designing and evaluating adaptive, bias-aware LLM-based AI systems in interactive contexts.

*Subhadip Maji,Arnab Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) is a novel GNN-based method for cross-lingual knowledge transfer that significantly outperforms existing approaches for low-resource language tasks like POS tagging, sentiment classification, and NER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource languages face significant performance gaps compared to high-resource languages due to data scarcity and insufficient linguistic resources. Cross-lingual knowledge transfer offers a promising solution by leveraging resources from high-resource languages to improve performance on low-resource language tasks.

Method: The paper introduces GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation), a novel GNN-based approach for cross-lingual knowledge transfer. It compares against two baseline methods: (1) augmentation in hidden layers, and (2) token embedding transfer through token translation. The research focuses on sentence-level and word-level tasks with only hundreds of labeled training instances for low-resource languages.

Result: GETR achieves 13 percentage point improvements on truly low-resource languages (Mizo, Khasi) for POS tagging, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam) for sentiment classification and NER tasks respectively. The method significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN-based GETR method effectively transfers linguistic knowledge from high-resource to low-resource languages, demonstrating substantial performance gains across multiple NLP tasks. The paper provides detailed analysis of transfer mechanisms and identifies key factors contributing to successful knowledge transfer in low-resource linguistic contexts.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in natural language processing, developing effective systems for low-resource languages remains a formidable challenge, with performances typically lagging far behind high-resource counterparts due to data scarcity and insufficient linguistic resources. Cross-lingual knowledge transfer has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge by leveraging resources from high-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate methods for transferring linguistic knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, where the number of labeled training instances is in hundreds. We focus on sentence-level and word-level tasks. We introduce a novel method, GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer along with two adopted baselines (a) augmentation in hidden layers and (b) token embedding transfer through token translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-based approach significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baseline methods, achieving 13 percentage point improvements on truly low-resource languages (Mizo, Khasi) for POS tagging, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam) across sentiment classification and NER tasks respectively. We also present a detailed analysis of the transfer mechanisms and identify key factors that contribute to successful knowledge transfer in this linguistic context.

TL;DR: Resin (Reactive Signal Inference) is a probabilistic programming language that combines probabilistic logic with reactive programming, enabling efficient exact inference in dynamic environments by adapting computations to input signal volatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact inference in complex probabilistic models is computationally expensive, especially for autonomous agents in dynamic environments requiring real-time belief updates. Existing methods are inefficient because they re-evaluate entire models upon any change, ignoring that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates.

Method: Introduces Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language merging probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Proposes Reactive Circuits (RCs) as meta-structures over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams - time-dynamic DAGs that autonomously adapt based on input signal volatility. Partitions computations based on estimated Frequency of Change in asynchronous inputs to decompose large inference tasks into memoized sub-problems.

Result: In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, achieves several orders of magnitude speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning.

Conclusion: By partitioning computations based on input signal volatility and only re-evaluating affected model components, the approach drastically reduces redundant computation in streaming contexts, enabling efficient exact inference for autonomous agents in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Exact inference in complex probabilistic models often incurs prohibitive computational costs. This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.

*Benny Cheung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative Ontology combines traditional ontologies with LLMs to create structured, valid outputs while maintaining creativity, demonstrated through game design generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ontologies provide structural validity but lack creativity, while LLMs generate fluently but produce structurally invalid outputs with hallucinations. The paper aims to synthesize these complementary strengths.

Method: Framework encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas that constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. Uses multi-agent pipeline with specialized roles (Mechanics Architect, Theme Weaver, Balance Critic) each with professional "anxiety" to prevent shallow outputs. Incorporates retrieval-augmented generation and iterative validation.

Result: Demonstrated through GameGrammar system that generates complete, playable tabletop game designs from thematic prompts, producing structurally complete specifications with mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions that satisfy ontological constraints while remaining creative.

Conclusion: The pattern generalizes beyond games to any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars. Constraints enable rather than limit creativity, making structured generation possible through ontological frameworks.

Abstract: Traditional ontologies excel at describing domain structure but cannot generate novel artifacts. Large language models generate fluently but produce outputs that lack structural validity, hallucinating mechanisms without components, goals without end conditions. We introduce Generative Ontology, a framework that synthesizes these complementary strengths: ontology provides the grammar; the LLM provides the creativity.
  Generative Ontology encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas that constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles to different ontology domains: a Mechanics Architect designs game systems, a Theme Weaver integrates narrative, a Balance Critic identifies exploits. Each agent carrying a professional "anxiety" that prevents shallow, agreeable outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds novel designs in precedents from existing exemplars, while iterative validation ensures coherence between mechanisms and components.
  We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs. Given a thematic prompt ("bioluminescent fungi competing in a cave ecosystem"), the pipeline produces structurally complete, playable game specifications with mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions. These outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining genuinely creative.
  The pattern generalizes beyond games. Any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars (music composition, software architecture, culinary arts) is a candidate for Generative Ontology. We argue that constraints do not limit creativity but enable it: just as grammar makes poetry possible, ontology makes structured generation possible.

Abstract: Memory emerges as the core module in the Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents for long-horizon complex tasks (e.g., multi-turn dialogue, game playing, scientific discovery), where memory can enable knowledge accumulation, iterative reasoning and self-evolution. Among diverse paradigms, graph stands out as a powerful structure for agent memory due to the intrinsic capabilities to model relational dependencies, organize hierarchical information, and support efficient retrieval. This survey presents a comprehensive review of agent memory from the graph-based perspective. First, we introduce a taxonomy of agent memory, including short-term vs. long-term memory, knowledge vs. experience memory, non-structural vs. structural memory, with an implementation view of graph-based memory. Second, according to the life cycle of agent memory, we systematically analyze the key techniques in graph-based agent memory, covering memory extraction for transforming the data into the contents, storage for organizing the data efficiently, retrieval for retrieving the relevant contents from memory to support reasoning, and evolution for updating the contents in the memory. Third, we summarize the open-sourced libraries and benchmarks that support the development and evaluation of self-evolving agent memory. We also explore diverse application scenarios. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to offer actionable insights to advance the development of more efficient and reliable graph-based agent memory systems.

TL;DR: LLM energy consumption follows non-linear efficiency regimes with sweet spots, not simple linear patterns. Proposed analytical model accurately predicts energy use across models and sequence lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current energy estimation methods use overly simplistic linear functions of input/output lengths, but real LLM inference shows complex non-linear efficiency patterns. Understanding these patterns is crucial for reducing energy consumption in AI applications.

Method: Developed an analytical model based on Transformer architecture's computational and memory-access complexity. Evaluated using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across diverse LLMs (1B-9B parameters) with input/output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens.

Result: Model achieved mean MAPE of 1.79% accuracy. Identified clear efficiency regimes: peak efficiency at short-to-moderate inputs with medium-length outputs, sharp drops for long inputs or very short outputs.

Conclusion: Aligning sequence lengths with identified efficiency "sweet spots" can substantially reduce energy usage, enabling informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inference is central in modern AI applications, making it critical to understand their energy footprint. Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency "Sweet Spots" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.

TL;DR: GenLoRA replaces explicit basis vector storage in LoRA with lightweight nonlinear functions, achieving higher parameter efficiency and better fine-tuning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA's explicit-rank paradigm leads to substantial parameter growth when increasing model capacity, and the basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy that can be more compactly represented.

Method: GenLoRA maintains latent vectors for each low-rank matrix and uses lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize basis vectors instead of storing them explicitly, requiring far fewer parameters per basis vector.

Result: Extensive experiments show GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance across multiple datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: GenLoRA provides a more parameter-efficient alternative to standard LoRA by replacing explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation, enabling better fine-tuning performance with fewer parameters.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) approximates the update of a pretrained weight matrix using the product of two low-rank matrices. However, standard LoRA follows an explicit-rank paradigm, where increasing model capacity requires adding more rows or columns (i.e., basis vectors) to the low-rank matrices, leading to substantial parameter growth. In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures show that GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance.

TL;DR: APO replaces KL regularization's rigid shape matching with support coverage, allowing aggressive sharpening for efficiency while preventing collapse through elastic recovery, breaking the accuracy-diversity trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR suffers from Recursive Space Contraction (RSC) where valid alternatives vanish due to combined positive sharpening and negative squeezing dynamics, while KL regularization creates gradient conflicts by forcing rigid shape matching.

Method: Anchored Policy Optimization (APO) shifts from global shape matching to support coverage, defining a Safe Manifold based on reference model's high-confidence support, allowing aggressive sharpening while using restorative force during error correction.

Result: APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods in mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: APO provides a gradient-aligned mechanism for elastic recovery that prevents collapse while maintaining efficiency, offering a superior alternative to KL regularization for RLVR.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is increasingly viewed as a tree pruning mechanism. However, we identify a systemic pathology termed Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse driven by the combined dynamics of positive sharpening and negative squeezing, where the sampling probability of valid alternatives vanishes. While Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization aims to mitigate this, it imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that forces the policy to mimic the reference model's full density, creating a gradient conflict with the sharpening required for correctness. We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches. Empirical evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLFKV: Reinforcement Learning with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification reduces hallucinations in financial RAG systems by decomposing responses into atomic knowledge units and verifying each unit against retrieved documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial RAG systems suffer from hallucinations where generated responses contradict retrieved information, despite using retrieved documents to address knowledge gaps in time-sensitive financial domains.

Method: Proposes RLFKV framework that decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units, computes fine-grained faithful reward by verifying each unit against retrieved documents, and adds informativeness reward to prevent overly concise replies.

Result: Experiments on Financial Data Description (FDD) task and new FDD-ANT dataset show consistent improvements, confirming effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: Fine-grained knowledge verification through atomic unit decomposition provides more precise optimization signals, improving alignment with retrieved documents and reducing hallucinations in financial RAG systems.

Abstract: In financial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, models frequently rely on retrieved documents to generate accurate responses due to the time-sensitive nature of the financial domain. While retrieved documents help address knowledge gaps, model-generated responses still suffer from hallucinations that contradict the retrieved information. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV). Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward. This reward offers more precise optimization signals, thereby improving alignment with the retrieved documents. Additionally, to prevent reward hacking (e.g., overly concise replies), we incorporate an informativeness reward that encourages the policy model to retain at least as many knowledge units as the base model. Experiments conducted on the public Financial Data Description (FDD) task and our newly proposed FDD-ANT dataset demonstrate consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

*Amit Kravchik Taub,Fred M. Grabovski,Guy Amit,Yisroel Mirsky*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeakBoost is a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes model representations to enhance membership inference attacks, achieving significant performance improvements over static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing membership inference attacks rely on static indicators like loss or confidence, failing to leverage dynamic model behavior when actively probed, which limits their effectiveness in detecting training data membership.

Method: LeakBoost synthesizes interrogation images by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective to amplify representational differences between members and non-members, then analyzes these with off-the-shelf membership detectors without modifying them.

Result: LeakBoost substantially improves membership inference performance: raises AUC from 0.53-0.62 to 0.81-0.88, increases TPR at 1% FPR by over an order of magnitude across multiple datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: LeakBoost offers a modular, computationally efficient approach for privacy risk assessment in white-box settings, advancing dynamic membership inference by showing that deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce strongest leakage.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a sample was part of a model's training set, posing serious privacy risks for modern machine-learning systems. Existing MIAs primarily rely on static indicators, such as loss or confidence, and do not fully leverage the dynamic behavior of models when actively probed. We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals. Given a candidate input, LeakBoost synthesizes an interrogation image by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective, amplifying representational differences between members and non-members. This image is then analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector, without modifying the detector itself. When combined with existing membership inference methods, LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures. In particular, it raises AUC from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and increases TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude compared to strong baseline attacks. A detailed sensitivity analysis reveals that deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce the strongest leakage, and that improvements concentrate in gradient-based detectors. LeakBoost thus offers a modular and computationally efficient way to assess privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference.

TL;DR: Automatic AI agent optimization methods are tested on Rocq theorem proving agents, showing few-shot bootstrapping works best but still can't match carefully engineered state-of-the-art agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if automatic optimization methods can replace manual fine-tuning of AI agents in formal verification settings, specifically for theorem proving in Rocq.

Method: Evaluated different automatic agent optimizers on Rocq proof-generation agents, testing automation of prompt design, contextual knowledge, and control strategies.

Result: Several optimizers showed measurable improvements, with simple few-shot bootstrapping being most consistently effective, but none matched carefully engineered state-of-the-art agents.

Conclusion: Automatic optimization methods can improve agent performance but cannot yet replace the careful engineering required for state-of-the-art theorem proving agents.

Abstract: This work studies the applicability of automatic AI agent optimization methods to real-world agents in formal verification settings, focusing on automated theorem proving in Rocq as a representative and challenging domain. We evaluate how different automatic agent optimizers perform when applied to the task of optimizing a Rocq proof-generation agent, and assess whether parts of the fine-grained tuning of agentic systems, such as prompt design, contextual knowledge, and control strategies, can be automated. Our results show that while several optimizers yield measurable improvements, simple few-shot bootstrapping is the most consistently effective; however, none of the studied methods matches the performance of a carefully engineered state-of-the-art proof agent.

TL;DR: Proposes a fully-asynchronous policy training framework for Vision-Language-Action models that decouples environment interaction, rollout generation, and model updates to overcome synchronous execution bottlenecks and improve training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based training frameworks for VLA models rely on synchronous execution, causing severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation, and model update phases.

Method: A fully-asynchronous policy training framework with multi-level decoupled architecture: asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction/trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates.

Result: Achieves up to 59.25% throughput improvement on LIBERO benchmark vs synchronous strategies; with deep optimization, throughput increases up to 126.67%. Shows excellent scalability across 8-256 GPUs via scaling law validation.

Conclusion: The proposed asynchronous framework effectively addresses training efficiency bottlenecks in VLA models, demonstrating significant throughput improvements and good scalability while maintaining training effectiveness.

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a crucial pathway towards general embodied intelligence, yet their training efficiency has become a key bottleneck. Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions.

Conclusion: FiMI successfully demonstrates that domain specialization for Indian financial systems yields significant performance improvements on financial tasks while preserving general language understanding capabilities, making it a valuable model for digital payment applications.

Abstract: We present FiMI (Finance Model for India), a domain-specialized financial language model developed for Indian digital payment systems. We develop two model variants: FiMI Base and FiMI Instruct. FiMI adapts the Mistral Small 24B architecture through a multi-stage training pipeline, beginning with continuous pre-training on 68 Billion tokens of curated financial, multilingual (English, Hindi, Hinglish), and synthetic data.

### [389] [NEX: Neuron Explore-Exploit Scoring for Label-Free Chain-of-Thought Selection and Model Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05805)
*Kang Chen,Zhuoka Feng,Sihan Zhao,Kai Xiong,Junjie Nian,Yaoning Wang,Changyi Xiao,Yixin Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NEX is an unsupervised scoring framework that analyzes reasoning patterns in LLMs by detecting exploration-exploitation phases through neuron activation patterns, enabling label-free ranking of candidate responses without task answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs increasingly use compute for multiple reasoning traces or merged checkpoints, the bottleneck shifts from generation to selection, often without supervision on target distributions. Current exploration proxies show inverted-U relationships with accuracy, suggesting redundant exploration and overthinking.

Method: NEX views reasoning as alternating exploration (E-phase) and exploitation (X-phase). It detects E-phase via spikes in newly activated MLP neurons per token from sparse activation caches, uses a sticky two-state HMM to infer E-X phases, and credits E-introduced neurons based on whether they're reused in subsequent X spans.

Result: NEX produces interpretable neuron weights and a single Good-Mass Fraction score that effectively ranks candidate responses and merged variants without task answers. It predicts downstream accuracy across reasoning benchmarks and Qwen3 merge families, and validates E-X signals with human annotations and causal evidence via neuron transfer experiments.

Conclusion: NEX provides a white-box, label-free unsupervised scoring framework that addresses the selection bottleneck in LLM reasoning by analyzing exploration-exploitation dynamics through neuron activation patterns, offering an effective way to rank responses without supervision.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly spend inference compute sampling multiple chain-of-thought traces or searching over merged checkpoints. This shifts the bottleneck from generation to selection, often without supervision on the target distribution. We show entropy-based exploration proxies follow an inverted-U with accuracy, suggesting extra exploration can become redundant and induce overthinking. We propose NEX, a white-box label-free unsupervised scoring framework that views reasoning as alternating E-phase (exploration) and X-phase (exploitation). NEX detects E-phase as spikes in newly activated MLP neurons per token from sparse activation caches, then uses a sticky two-state HMM to infer E-X phases and credits E-introduced neurons by whether they are reused in the following X span. These signals yield interpretable neuron weights and a single Good-Mass Fraction score to rank candidate responses and merged variants without task answers. Across reasoning benchmarks and Qwen3 merge families, NEX computed on a small unlabeled activation set predicts downstream accuracy and identifies better variants; we further validate the E-X signal with human annotations and provide causal evidence via "Effective-vs-Redundant" neuron transfer.

Motivation: Current LLM prompting strategies for TKGQA suffer from reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints and lack optimization through dynamic interaction with TKGs, limiting model autonomy and generalization.

Method: Propose TKG-Thinker agent with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities. Uses dual-training: 1) Supervised Fine-Tuning with chain-of-thought data for core planning, 2) Reinforcement Learning with multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under temporal constraints.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with three open-source LLMs and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.

Conclusion: TKG-Thinker effectively addresses limitations of current prompting strategies by enabling dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs and refined reasoning through dual-training, demonstrating superior performance and generalization in temporal knowledge graph QA.

Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) aims to answer time-sensitive questions by leveraging temporal knowledge bases. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways. First, they are prone to reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints. Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with three open-source LLMs show that TKG-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.

Motivation: Large organizations with hierarchical structures need to seat closely related teams near each other (e.g., research groups in contiguous areas). Currently this is done manually, leading to infrequent and suboptimal replanning efforts.

Method: End-to-end framework combining: 1) Scalable distance calculation using probabilistic road maps (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT), 2) Heuristic search and dynamic programming, 3) Integer programming to solve the HSAP optimization problem.

Result: Demonstrated approach under different sized instances by evaluating both the PRM framework and subsequent allocations quantitatively and qualitatively, showing effectiveness of the automated solution.

Conclusion: The proposed framework automates the hierarchical seating allocation problem, replacing manual processes with scalable optimization that ensures hierarchical proximity while considering physical floor plan constraints.

Abstract: We introduce the Hierarchical Seating Allocation Problem (HSAP) which addresses the optimal assignment of hierarchically structured organizational teams to physical seating arrangements on a floor plan. This problem is driven by the necessity for large organizations with large hierarchies to ensure that teams with close hierarchical relationships are seated in proximity to one another, such as ensuring a research group occupies a contiguous area. Currently, this problem is managed manually leading to infrequent and suboptimal replanning efforts. To alleviate this manual process, we propose an end-to-end framework to solve the HSAP. A scalable approach to calculate the distance between any pair of seats using a probabilistic road map (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) which is combined with heuristic search and dynamic programming approach to solve the HSAP using integer programming. We demonstrate our approach under different sized instances by evaluating the PRM framework and subsequent allocations both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Motivation: LLM-based conversational agents in vehicles create novel security challenges at the intersection of AI, automotive safety, and inter-agent communication.

Method: AgentHeLLM framework with: 1) human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented "victim modeling" inspired by Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 2) formal graph-based model distinguishing poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions), and 3) open-source AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator tool using bi-level search strategy for automated multi-stage threat discovery.

Result: The framework provides practical applicability through an open-source tool that automates threat discovery, addressing the methodological gap in existing AI security frameworks for safety-critical automotive systems.

Conclusion: AgentHeLLM offers a systematic approach to threat modeling for LLM-based automotive assistants by formally separating asset identification from attack path analysis, enabling better security assessment for safety-critical systems where AI agents coordinate with external services.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based conversational agents into vehicles creates novel security challenges at the intersection of agentic AI, automotive safety, and inter-agent communication. As these intelligent assistants coordinate with external services via protocols such as Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), they establish attack surfaces where manipulations can propagate through natural language payloads, potentially causing severe consequences ranging from driver distraction to unauthorized vehicle control. Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous "separation of concerns" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented "victim modeling" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions). We demonstrate the framework's practical applicability through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in M&S workflows, but seemingly straightforward practices can introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or lead to inferior results. The paper aims to address common misconceptions and provide comprehensive guidance for modelers.

Method: The paper discusses common sources of confusion including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings. It emphasizes principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation.

Result: The paper provides practical guidance on avoiding pitfalls such as: adding more data backfiring (model collapse), unnecessary fine-tuning without prior assessment, temperature settings not ensuring determinism, and excessive input data overwhelming LLMs while naive simplifications lose information.

Conclusion: The paper helps modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs in M&S applications by providing comprehensive guidance on avoiding common pitfalls and implementing effective strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become familiar tools to researchers and practitioners. Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings. We emphasize principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation, with the goal of helping modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs.

Abstract: This paper addresses the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by comparing classical and quantum Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems such as the CVRP.

### [399] [Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting for Urban Motorway Digital Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05983)
*Krešimir Kušić,Vinny Cahill,Ivana Dusparic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GATTF model uses geographical relationships via mutual information to improve motorway traffic forecasting accuracy without increasing model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital twins need accurate traffic predictions for proactive decision-making, but current sequence-based deep learning models have limitations in forecasting accuracy and complexity for spatio-temporal traffic data.

Method: Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting (GATTF) model that exploits geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI).

Result: Evaluation with Geneva motorway network data shows GATTF outperforms standard Transformer in forecasting accuracy while maintaining same model complexity.

Conclusion: Incorporating geographical awareness through mutual information enhances traffic forecasting accuracy without increasing model complexity, advancing digital twin capabilities for motorway traffic management.

Abstract: The operational effectiveness of digital-twin technology in motorway traffic management depends on the availability of a continuous flow of high-resolution real-time traffic data. To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements. To improve motorway traffic forecasting, this paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting GATTF model, which exploits the geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI). The model has been evaluated using real-time data from the Geneva motorway network in Switzerland and results confirm that incorporating geographical awareness through MI enhances the accuracy of GATTF forecasting compared to a standard Transformer, without increasing model complexity.

Conclusion: Whisper shows strong potential as a representation extractor for Speech Emotion Recognition. Attention-based pooling methods are effective for dimension reduction while preserving emotional features. The approach offers efficient, lightweight alternative to larger models.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) research has faced limitations due to the lack of standard and sufficiently large datasets. Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained models to extract features for downstream tasks such as SER. This work explores the capabilities of Whisper, a pre-trained ASR system, in speech emotion recognition by proposing two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, designed to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of Whisper representations while preserving emotional features. We experiment on English and Persian, using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets respectively, with Whisper Tiny and Small. Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy. We further compare the performance of different Whisper encoder layers and find that intermediate layers often perform better for SER on the Persian dataset, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to much larger models such as HuBERT X-Large. Our findings highlight the potential of Whisper as a representation extractor for SER and demonstrate the effectiveness of attention-based pooling for dimension reduction.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly expected to negotiate, coordinate, and transact autonomously, yet existing benchmarks lack principled settings for evaluating language-mediated economic interaction among multiple agents. We introduce AgenticPay, a benchmark and simulation framework for multi-agent buyer-seller negotiation driven by natural language. AgenticPay models markets in which buyers and sellers possess private constraints and product-dependent valuations, and must reach agreements through multi-round linguistic negotiation rather than numeric bidding alone. The framework supports a diverse suite of over 110 tasks ranging from bilateral bargaining to many-to-many markets, with structured action extraction and metrics for feasibility, efficiency, and welfare. Benchmarking state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs reveals substantial gaps in negotiation performance and highlights challenges in long-horizon strategic reasoning, establishing AgenticPay as a foundation for studying agentic commerce and language-based market interaction.

### [402] [DyTopo: Dynamic Topology Routing for Multi-Agent Reasoning via Semantic Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06039)
*Yuxing Lu,Yucheng Hu,Xukai Zhao,Jiuxin Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DyTopo is a manager-guided multi-agent framework that dynamically reconstructs sparse directed communication graphs at each reasoning round using semantic matching of agent needs and offers, improving multi-round reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent systems use fixed communication patterns that don't match the stage-dependent needs of iterative problem solving, limiting their effectiveness for multi-round reasoning tasks.

Method: DyTopo uses a manager to set round goals, then each agent outputs natural-language "need" and "offer" descriptors. These are embedded and semantically matched to create sparse directed communication graphs, routing private messages only along induced edges.

Result: DyTopo consistently outperforms the strongest baseline by average +6.2% across code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks using four LLM backbones, while providing interpretable coordination traces.

Conclusion: Dynamic communication graph reconstruction based on semantic matching of agent needs/offers significantly improves multi-agent reasoning performance and provides interpretable coordination patterns that adapt across reasoning rounds.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built from prompted large language models can improve multi-round reasoning, yet most existing pipelines rely on fixed, trajectory-wide communication patterns that are poorly matched to the stage-dependent needs of iterative problem solving. We introduce DyTopo, a manager-guided multi-agent framework that reconstructs a sparse directed communication graph at each round. Conditioned on the manager's round goal, each agent outputs lightweight natural-language query (need) and \key (offer) descriptors; DyTopo embeds these descriptors and performs semantic matching, routing private messages only along the induced edges. Across code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks and four LLM backbones, DyTopo consistently outperforms over the strongest baseline (avg. +6.2). Beyond accuracy, DyTopo yields an interpretable coordination trace via the evolving graphs, enabling qualitative inspection of how communication pathways reconfigure across rounds.
