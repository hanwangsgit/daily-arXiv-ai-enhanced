### [1] [SkyCap: Bitemporal VHR Optical-SAR Quartets for Amplitude Change Detection and Foundation-Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14755)
*Paul Weinmann,Ferdinand Schenck,Martin Šiklar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkyCap dataset enables optical-to-SAR label transfer for change detection, showing optical foundation models outperform SAR-specific ones on VHR SAR amplitude change detection with proper preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need reliable change detection for linear infrastructure monitoring requires consistent high-resolution data. Optical VHR imagery is interpretable but cloud-dependent, while SAR provides all-weather capability but is difficult to annotate.

Method: Created SkyCap dataset by matching/co-registering SkySat optical and Capella Space SAR scenes, used optical-to-SAR label transfer for SAR annotations without expert labeling, performed continued pretraining of SARATR-X on SAR data, benchmarked SAR-specific and optical foundation models with different preprocessing.

Result: Optical FM MTP(ViT-B+RVSA) with dB+Z-score preprocessing achieved best F1 score (45.06), outperforming SAR-specific FMs pretrained on Capella data. Found strong sensitivity to preprocessing alignment with pretraining statistics, and optical model rankings don't directly transfer to SAR ACD.

Conclusion: First evaluation of foundation models on VHR SAR amplitude change detection shows optical models can outperform SAR-specific ones with proper preprocessing, but careful preprocessing alignment is crucial and optical model performance doesn't directly translate to SAR tasks.

Abstract: Change detection for linear infrastructure monitoring requires reliable high-resolution data and regular acquisition cadence. Optical very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery is interpretable and straightforward to label, but clouds break this cadence. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables all-weather acquisitions, yet is difficult to annotate. We introduce SkyCap, a bitemporal VHR optical-SAR dataset constructed by archive matching and co-registration of (optical) SkySat and Capella Space (SAR) scenes. We utilize optical-to-SAR label transfer to obtain SAR amplitude change detection (ACD) labels without requiring SAR-expert annotations. We perform continued pretraining of SARATR-X on our SAR data and benchmark the resulting SAR-specific foundation models (FMs) together with SARATR-X against optical FMs on SkyCap under different preprocessing choices. Among evaluated models, MTP(ViT-B+RVSA), an optical FM, with dB+Z-score preprocessing attains the best result (F1$_c$ = 45.06), outperforming SAR-specific FMs further pretrained directly on Capella data. We observe strong sensitivity to preprocessing alignment with pretraining statistics, and the ranking of optical models on optical change detection does not transfer one-to-one to SAR ACD. To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of foundation models on VHR SAR ACD.

### [2] [SocialNav-MoE: A Mixture-of-Experts Vision Language Model for Socially Compliant Navigation with Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14757)
*Tomohito Kawabata,Xinyu Zhang,Ling Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SocialNav-MoE: An efficient Mixture-of-Experts VLM for socially compliant navigation using reinforcement fine-tuning with semantic similarity rewards, achieving good balance between accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior robot navigation work focuses mainly on safety while neglecting social compliance (human comfort, social norms, contextual appropriateness). Large VLMs are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained robots.

Method: Propose SocialNav-MoE, an efficient Mixture-of-Experts vision language model for socially compliant navigation with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). Introduce semantic similarity reward (SSR) to enhance decision-making. Study different small language models (Phi, Qwen, StableLM), routing strategies, and vision encoders (CLIP vs. SigLIP, frozen vs. fine-tuned).

Result: Experiments on SNEI dataset show SocialNav-MoE achieves excellent balance between navigation accuracy and efficiency. SSR function is more effective than hard-level and character-level rewards.

Conclusion: Small VLMs with Mixture-of-Experts architecture and reinforcement fine-tuning with semantic similarity rewards can effectively address socially compliant navigation while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time robotic deployment.

Abstract: For robots navigating in human-populated environments, safety and social compliance are equally critical, yet prior work has mostly emphasized safety. Socially compliant navigation that accounts for human comfort, social norms, and contextual appropriateness remains underexplored. Vision language models (VLMs) show promise for this task; however, large-scale models incur substantial computational overhead, leading to higher inference latency and energy consumption, which makes them unsuitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address this issue, we investigate the effectiveness of small VLM and propose SocialNav-MoE, an efficient Mixture-of-Experts vision language model for socially compliant navigation with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We further introduce a semantic similarity reward (SSR) to effectively leverage RFT for enhancing the decision-making capabilities. Additionally, we study the effectiveness of different small language model types (Phi, Qwen, and StableLM), routing strategies, and vision encoders (CLIP vs. SigLIP, frozen vs. fine-tuned). Experiments on the SNEI dataset demonstrate that SocialNav-MoE achieves an excellent balance between navigation accuracy and efficiency. The proposed SSR function is more effective than hard-level and character-level rewards. Source code will be released upon acceptance.

*Fan Bu,Rongfeng Li,Zijin Li,Ya Li,Linfeng Fan,Pei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid expert-system pipeline for optical music recognition of Chinese Jianpu notation with lyrics, achieving high accuracy without large annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale OMR research has focused mainly on Western staff notation, leaving Chinese Jianpu notation and its rich lyric resources underexplored, creating a need for specialized recognition systems.

Method: Modular expert-system pipeline combining traditional computer vision techniques (phrase correlation, skeleton analysis) with unsupervised deep-learning modules for image feature embeddings, using top-down design to leverage prior knowledge.

Result: Successfully digitized over 5,000 melody-only songs (300,000+ notes) and 1,400+ songs with lyrics (100,000+ notes) from The Anthology of Chinese Folk Songs, achieving note-wise F1 = 0.951 for melody and character-wise F1 = 0.931 for aligned lyrics.

Conclusion: The hybrid expert-system approach effectively bridges the gap between interpretability and accuracy for Chinese Jianpu OMR, enabling large-scale digitization without requiring massive annotated training data.

Abstract: Large-scale optical music recognition (OMR) research has focused mainly on Western staff notation, leaving Chinese Jianpu (numbered notation) and its rich lyric resources underexplored. We present a modular expert-system pipeline that converts printed Jianpu scores with lyrics into machine-readable MusicXML and MIDI, without requiring massive annotated training data. Our approach adopts a top-down expert-system design, leveraging traditional computer-vision techniques (e.g., phrase correlation, skeleton analysis) to capitalize on prior knowledge, while integrating unsupervised deep-learning modules for image feature embeddings. This hybrid strategy strikes a balance between interpretability and accuracy. Evaluated on The Anthology of Chinese Folk Songs, our system massively digitizes (i) a melody-only collection of more than 5,000 songs (> 300,000 notes) and (ii) a curated subset with lyrics comprising over 1,400 songs (> 100,000 notes). The system achieves high-precision recognition on both melody (note-wise F1 = 0.951) and aligned lyrics (character-wise F1 = 0.931).

### [4] [AquaDiff: Diffusion-Based Underwater Image Enhancement for Addressing Color Distortion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14760)
*Afrah Shaahid,Muzammil Behzad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AquaDiff is a diffusion-based underwater image enhancement framework that corrects color distortion while preserving structural and perceptual fidelity through chromatic prior-guided color compensation and conditional diffusion with cross-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from severe degradation due to wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering, causing color distortion, low contrast, and loss of fine details that hinder vision-based underwater applications.

Method: AquaDiff integrates chromatic prior-guided color compensation with conditional diffusion process using cross-attention to fuse degraded inputs and noisy latent states. It features an enhanced denoising backbone with residual dense blocks and multi-resolution attention, plus a novel cross-domain consistency loss enforcing pixel-level accuracy, perceptual similarity, structural integrity, and frequency-domain fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple challenging underwater benchmarks show AquaDiff provides good results compared to state-of-the-art traditional, CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based methods, achieving superior color correction and competitive overall image quality across diverse underwater conditions.

Conclusion: AquaDiff effectively addresses underwater image degradation challenges through a diffusion-based framework that combines chromatic compensation with advanced attention mechanisms and comprehensive loss functions, demonstrating strong performance in color correction and image quality enhancement.

Abstract: Underwater images are severely degraded by wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering, resulting in color distortion, low contrast, and loss of fine details that hinder vision-based underwater applications. To address these challenges, we propose AquaDiff, a diffusion-based underwater image enhancement framework designed to correct chromatic distortions while preserving structural and perceptual fidelity. AquaDiff integrates a chromatic prior-guided color compensation strategy with a conditional diffusion process, where cross-attention dynamically fuses degraded inputs and noisy latent states at each denoising step. An enhanced denoising backbone with residual dense blocks and multi-resolution attention captures both global color context and local details. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain consistency loss jointly enforces pixel-level accuracy, perceptual similarity, structural integrity, and frequency-domain fidelity. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging underwater benchmarks demonstrate that AquaDiff provides good results as compared to the state-of-the-art traditional, CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based methods, achieving superior color correction and competitive overall image quality across diverse underwater conditions.

### [5] [Improving VQA Reliability: A Dual-Assessment Approach with Self-Reflection and Cross-Model Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14770)
*Xixian Wu,Yang Ou,Pengchao Tian,Zian Yang,Jielei Zhang,Peiyi Li,Longwen Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAVR framework integrates self-reflection and cross-model verification to reduce hallucinations and improve reliability in vision-language models for VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models suffer from hallucinations that produce overconfident but incorrect answers, undermining answer reliability in VQA tasks.

Method: Dual-pathway architecture: one pathway uses dual selector modules to assess response reliability by fusing VLM latent features with QA embeddings; the other deploys external reference models for factual cross-checking.

Result: Achieved leading Φ₁₀₀ score of 39.64 and 100-AUC of 97.22, securing first place in Reliable VQA Challenge at ICCV-CLVL 2025.

Conclusion: DAVR effectively enhances trustworthiness of VLM responses through comprehensive uncertainty estimation and hallucination mitigation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, the susceptibility of VLMs to hallucinations can lead to overconfident yet incorrect answers, severely undermining answer reliability. To address this, we propose Dual-Assessment for VLM Reliability (DAVR), a novel framework that integrates Self-Reflection and Cross-Model Verification for comprehensive uncertainty estimation. The DAVR framework features a dual-pathway architecture: one pathway leverages dual selector modules to assess response reliability by fusing VLM latent features with QA embeddings, while the other deploys external reference models for factual cross-checking to mitigate hallucinations. Evaluated in the Reliable VQA Challenge at ICCV-CLVL 2025, DAVR achieves a leading $Φ_{100}$ score of 39.64 and a 100-AUC of 97.22, securing first place and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the trustworthiness of VLM responses.

### [6] [HERBench: A Benchmark for Multi-Evidence Integration in Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14870)
*Dan Ben-Ami,Gabriele Serussi,Kobi Cohen,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERBench is a new VideoQA benchmark designed to test multi-evidence integration across time, requiring aggregation of at least three non-overlapping visual cues from different video segments, with results showing current Video-LLMs perform poorly (31-42% accuracy vs 20% random baseline).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA benchmarks often allow questions to be answered from single salient cues, under-testing reasoning that requires aggregating multiple temporally separated visual evidence. There's a need for benchmarks that specifically assess multi-evidence integration across time.

Method: Created HERBench with 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into twelve compositional tasks probing identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting. Introduced Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS) metric to measure evidential demand. Evaluated 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs.

Result: HERBench imposes substantially higher evidential demand than prior datasets (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2). Current Video-LLMs perform poorly with accuracies of 31-42% (only slightly above 20% random baseline). Two critical bottlenecks identified: retrieval deficit (frame selectors miss key evidence) and fusion deficit (models fail to integrate information even with all evidence).

Conclusion: HERBench establishes a principled target for advancing robust, compositional video understanding by making cross-time evidence both unavoidable and quantifiable, revealing significant limitations in current Video-LLMs' ability to integrate multiple temporal evidence.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) are rapidly improving, yet current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) benchmarks often allow questions to be answered from a single salient cue, under-testing reasoning that must aggregate multiple, temporally separated visual evidence. We present HERBench, a VideoQA benchmark purpose-built to assess multi-evidence integration across time. Each question requires aggregating at least three non-overlapping evidential cues across distinct video segments, so neither language priors nor a single snapshot can suffice. HERBench comprises 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into twelve compositional tasks that probe identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting. To make evidential demand measurable, we introduce the Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS), the smallest number of frames a model must fuse to answer correctly, and show that HERBench imposes substantially higher demand than prior datasets (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2). Evaluating 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs on HERBench reveals pervasive failures: accuracies of 31-42% are only slightly above the 20% random-guess baseline. We disentangle this failure into two critical bottlenecks: (1) a retrieval deficit, where frame selectors overlook key evidence, and (2) a fusion deficit, where models fail to integrate information even when all necessary evidence is provided. By making cross-time evidence both unavoidable and quantifiable, HERBench establishes a principled target for advancing robust, compositional video understanding.

### [7] [Isolated Sign Language Recognition with Segmentation and Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14876)
*Daniel Perkins,Davis Hunter,Dhrumil Patel,Galen Flanagan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight model for American Sign Language recognition that uses pose estimation and segmentation to reduce computational costs while handling signer variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have automated translations for spoken/written languages but remain inaccessible to ASL users. Current ISLR systems face challenges with scarce data, high signer variability, and high computational costs.

Method: Three-component approach: (1) pose estimation pipeline to extract hand and face joint coordinates, (2) segmentation module to isolate relevant information, (3) ResNet-Transformer backbone to jointly model spatial and temporal dependencies.

Result: Proposed model reduces computational requirements while maintaining robustness to signer variation (specific quantitative results not provided in abstract).

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses key limitations in ISLR by creating a more efficient and robust system for American Sign Language recognition.

Abstract: The recent surge in large language models has automated translations of spoken and written languages. However, these advances remain largely inaccessible to American Sign Language (ASL) users, whose language relies on complex visual cues. Isolated sign language recognition (ISLR) - the task of classifying videos of individual signs - can help bridge this gap but is currently limited by scarce per-sign data, high signer variability, and substantial computational costs. We propose a model for ISLR that reduces computational requirements while maintaining robustness to signer variation. Our approach integrates (i) a pose estimation pipeline to extract hand and face joint coordinates, (ii) a segmentation module that isolates relevant information, and (iii) a ResNet-Transformer backbone to jointly model spatial and temporal dependencies.

### [8] [Visual-textual Dermatoglyphic Animal Biometrics: A First Case Study on Panthera tigris](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14878)
*Wenshuo Li,Majid Mirmehdi,Tilo Burghardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces dermatoglyphic textual descriptors for animal re-identification, combining visual and textual modalities to improve AI accuracy and explainability in ecological monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI tools for animal re-identification are largely image-based and limited to species with distinctive morphological features. The paper aims to extend Re-ID methodologies by incorporating precise dermatoglyphic textual descriptors (used in forensics) to overcome vision-only limitations and improve cross-modal identity retrieval.

Method: 1. Incorporates dermatoglyphic textual descriptors to abstract and encode animal coat topology using human-interpretable language tags. 2. Uses 84,264 manually labelled minutiae across 3,355 images of 185 tigers. 3. Develops a text-image co-synthesis pipeline to generate 'virtual individuals' (dozens of life-like visuals paired with dermatoglyphic text) to augment training data.

Result: The dermatoglyphic language-guided approach enables novel cross-modal identity retrieval capabilities. Benchmarking shows that data augmentation with virtual individuals significantly boosts AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval while alleviating data scarcity issues.

Conclusion: Dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics can overcome vision-only limitations, enabling textual-to-visual identity recovery with human-verifiable matchings. This represents a significant advance towards explainability in Re-ID and a language-driven unification of descriptive modalities in ecological monitoring.

Abstract: Biologists have long combined visuals with textual field notes to re-identify (Re-ID) animals. Contemporary AI tools automate this for species with distinctive morphological features but remain largely image-based. Here, we extend Re-ID methodologies by incorporating precise dermatoglyphic textual descriptors-an approach used in forensics but new to ecology. We demonstrate that these specialist semantics abstract and encode animal coat topology using human-interpretable language tags. Drawing on 84,264 manually labelled minutiae across 3,355 images of 185 tigers (Panthera tigris), we evaluate this visual-textual methodology, revealing novel capabilities for cross-modal identity retrieval. To optimise performance, we developed a text-image co-synthesis pipeline to generate 'virtual individuals', each comprising dozens of life-like visuals paired with dermatoglyphic text. Benchmarking against real-world scenarios shows this augmentation significantly boosts AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval while alleviating data scarcity. We conclude that dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics can overcome vision-only limitations, enabling textual-to-visual identity recovery underpinned by human-verifiable matchings. This represents a significant advance towards explainability in Re-ID and a language-driven unification of descriptive modalities in ecological monitoring.

### [9] [Vibe Spaces for Creatively Connecting and Expressing Visual Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14884)
*Huzheng Yang,Katherine Xu,Andrew Lu,Michael D. Grossberg,Yutong Bai,Jianbo Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vibe Blending task generates creative visual hybrids by finding shared "vibe" attributes between images. Vibe Space learns hierarchical graph manifolds to enable smooth semantic transitions in CLIP space, outperforming current methods on creativity and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to create meaningful visual hybrids between distant concepts because they can't identify nonlinear paths connecting them in latent space. The paper aims to enable creative visual concept creation by discovering shared "vibe" attributes between images.

Method: Proposes Vibe Space - a hierarchical graph manifold that learns low-dimensional geodesics in feature spaces like CLIP. This enables smooth, semantically consistent transitions between concepts by modeling nonlinear paths connecting them.

Result: Vibe Space produces blends that humans consistently rate as more creative and coherent than current methods. The evaluation uses a cognitively inspired framework combining human judgments, LLM reasoning, and geometric path-based difficulty scores.

Conclusion: Vibe Space successfully addresses the challenge of creating meaningful visual hybrids by learning hierarchical manifolds that capture shared semantic attributes between concepts, enabling more creative and coherent visual blending than existing approaches.

Abstract: Creating new visual concepts often requires connecting distinct ideas through their most relevant shared attributes -- their vibe. We introduce Vibe Blending, a novel task for generating coherent and meaningful hybrids that reveals these shared attributes between images. Achieving such blends is challenging for current methods, which struggle to identify and traverse nonlinear paths linking distant concepts in latent space. We propose Vibe Space, a hierarchical graph manifold that learns low-dimensional geodesics in feature spaces like CLIP, enabling smooth and semantically consistent transitions between concepts. To evaluate creative quality, we design a cognitively inspired framework combining human judgments, LLM reasoning, and a geometric path-based difficulty score. We find that Vibe Space produces blends that humans consistently rate as more creative and coherent than current methods.

### [10] [PANDA-PLUS-Bench: A Clinical Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of AI Foundation Models in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14922)
*Joshua L. Ebbert,Dennis Della Corte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANDA-PLUS-Bench is a curated benchmark dataset for evaluating AI foundation models' robustness in prostate cancer Gleason grading, specifically testing their ability to distinguish biological features from slide-specific artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI foundation models for prostate cancer Gleason grading may achieve high validation accuracy by learning specimen-specific artifacts rather than generalizable biological features, limiting their real-world clinical utility. There's a need to quantify this failure mode and evaluate model robustness.

Method: Created PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset from expert-annotated prostate biopsies with 9 whole slide images from unique patients. Extracted non-overlapping tissue patches at 512x512 and 224x224 resolutions across 8 augmentation conditions. Evaluated 7 foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders.

Result: Substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 had lowest slide-level encoding (81.0%) but second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder (trained on prostate tissue) showed highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%). All models had within-slide vs. cross-slide accuracy gaps (19.9-26.9 percentage points).

Conclusion: PANDA-PLUS-Bench addresses a critical gap in foundation model evaluation by providing a purpose-built resource for robustness assessment in Gleason grading. Tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signature recognition. The benchmark enables standardized evaluation of model robustness.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence foundation models are increasingly deployed for prostate cancer Gleason grading, where GP3/GP4 distinction directly impacts treatment decisions. However, these models may achieve high validation accuracy by learning specimen-specific artifacts rather than generalizable biological features, limiting real-world clinical utility. We introduce PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset derived from expert-annotated prostate biopsies designed specifically to quantify this failure mode. The benchmark comprises nine carefully selected whole slide images from nine unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns, with non-overlapping tissue patches extracted at both 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across eight augmentation conditions. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders. Our results reveal substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 achieved the lowest slide-level encoding among large-scale models (81.0%) yet exhibited the second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder, trained specifically on prostate tissue, demonstrated the highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and the strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%), suggesting tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures. All models exhibited measurable within-slide vs. cross-slide accuracy gaps, though the magnitude varied from 19.9 percentage points to 26.9 percentage points. We provide an open-source Google Colab notebook enabling researchers to evaluate additional foundation models against our benchmark using standardized metrics. PANDA-PLUS-Bench addresses a critical gap in foundation model evaluation by providing a purpose-built resource for robustness assessment in the clinically important context of Gleason grading.

*Abhijeet Parida,Daniel Capellán-Martín,Zhifan Jiang,Nishad Kulkarni,Krithika Iyer,Austin Tapp,Syed Muhammad Anwar,María J. Ledesma-Carbayo,Marius George Linguraru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes adaptive post-processing techniques to refine glioma segmentation from large-scale pre-trained models, improving performance in BraTS 2025 challenges while addressing computational fairness and sustainability concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale pre-trained models for glioma segmentation generalize poorly, produce systematic errors (false positives, label swaps, slice discontinuities), and create computational fairness issues due to unequal GPU access and environmental costs of training.

Method: Adaptive post-processing techniques to refine glioma segmentations produced by large-scale pre-trained models, demonstrated on multiple BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks.

Result: Ranking metric improved by 14.9% for sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for adult glioma challenge in BraTS 2025 segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The approach promotes a shift from complex model architectures to efficient, clinically aligned post-processing strategies that are precise, computationally fair, and sustainable for brain tumor segmentation research.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults and are among the most lethal. Despite aggressive treatment, the median survival rate is less than 15 months. Accurate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) tumor segmentation is critical for surgical planning, radiotherapy, and disease monitoring. While deep learning models have improved the accuracy of automated segmentation, large-scale pre-trained models generalize poorly and often underperform, producing systematic errors such as false positives, label swaps, and slice discontinuities in slices. These limitations are further compounded by unequal access to GPU resources and the growing environmental cost of large-scale model training. In this work, we propose adaptive post-processing techniques to refine the quality of glioma segmentations produced by large-scale pretrained models developed for various types of tumors. We demonstrated the techniques in multiple BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks, with the ranking metric improving by 14.9 % for the sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for the adult glioma challenge. This approach promotes a shift in brain tumor segmentation research from increasingly complex model architectures to efficient, clinically aligned post-processing strategies that are precise, computationally fair, and sustainable.

### [12] [TalkVerse: Democratizing Minute-Long Audio-Driven Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14938)
*Zhenzhi Wang,Jian Wang,Ke Ma,Dahua Lin,Bing Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TalkVerse is a large-scale open corpus for audio-driven talking video generation, featuring 2.3M high-resolution clips (6.3k hours) with comprehensive annotations, plus a reproducible 5B DiT baseline model that achieves minute-long generation with low drift and 10× lower inference cost than comparable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art talking video generation systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, creating barriers to fair comparison and reproducible research. There's a need for an open, large-scale dataset and efficient baseline models to enable accessible research in this field.

Method: Created TalkVerse corpus through transparent curation pipeline: scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, audio-visual synchronization checks, and comprehensive annotations (2D skeletons, structured captions). Built 5B DiT baseline using video VAE with high downsampling ratio and sliding window mechanism with motion-frame context for minute-long generation. Integrated MLLM director for prompt rewriting and used controlled latent noise injection for zero-shot video dubbing.

Result: TalkVerse offers 2.3M high-resolution clips (720p/1080p) totaling 6.3k hours from 60k+ hours of source video. The 5B model achieves comparable lip-sync and visual quality to 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10× lower inference cost, supports minute-long generation with low drift, and enables zero-shot video dubbing. All resources (dataset, recipes, checkpoints) are open-sourced.

Conclusion: TalkVerse provides a comprehensive open resource for fair comparison in audio-driven talking video generation research. The efficient 5B baseline model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computational costs, lowering barriers for research in this domain and enabling reproducible advancements.

Abstract: We introduce TalkVerse, a large-scale, open corpus for single-person, audio-driven talking video generation designed to enable fair, reproducible comparison across methods. While current state-of-the-art systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, TalkVerse offers 2.3 million high-resolution (720p/1080p) audio-video synchronized clips totaling 6.3k hours. These are curated from over 60k hours of video via a transparent pipeline that includes scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, strict audio-visual synchronization checks, and comprehensive annotations including 2D skeletons and structured visual/audio-style captions. Leveraging TalkVerse, we present a reproducible 5B DiT baseline built on Wan2.2-5B. By utilizing a video VAE with a high downsampling ratio and a sliding window mechanism with motion-frame context, our model achieves minute-long generation with low drift. It delivers comparable lip-sync and visual quality to the 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10$\times$ lower inference cost. To enhance storytelling in long videos, we integrate an MLLM director to rewrite prompts based on audio and visual cues. Furthermore, our model supports zero-shot video dubbing via controlled latent noise injection. We open-source the dataset, training recipes, and 5B checkpoints to lower barriers for research in audio-driven human video generation. Project Page: https://zhenzhiwang.github.io/talkverse/

### [13] [Puzzle Curriculum GRPO for Vision-Centric Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14944)
*Ahmadreza Jeddi,Hakki Can Karaimer,Hue Nguyen,Zhongling Wang,Ke Zhao,Javad Rajabi,Ran Zhang,Raghav Goyal,Babak Taati,Radek Grzeszczuk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PC-GRPO is a supervision-free RL method that improves visual reasoning in VLMs using self-supervised puzzle environments and a difficulty-aware curriculum, addressing issues with noisy annotations, sparse rewards, and reasoning-answer inconsistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for VLMs have three key problems: reliance on costly/noisy hand-curated annotations or external verifiers, flat/sparse reward schemes in GRPO, and logical inconsistency between reasoning chains and final answers.

Method: PC-GRPO uses three self-supervised puzzle environments (PatchFit, Rotation with binary rewards, Jigsaw with graded partial credit) to replace labels. It introduces a difficulty-aware curriculum that dynamically weights samples and peaks at medium difficulty, and monitors Reasoning-Answer Consistency during post-training.

Result: PC-GRPO improves reasoning quality, training stability, and end-task accuracy across diverse benchmarks on Qwen-7B and Qwen-3B backbones. The curriculum delays the decline in Reasoning-Answer Consistency, and consistency-enforcing reward schemes further boost RAC, which correlates with downstream accuracy.

Conclusion: PC-GRPO offers a practical path to scalable, verifiable, and interpretable RL post-training for VLMs without needing annotations or external verifiers, addressing key limitations of existing RL approaches for visual reasoning.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches like outcome-supervised GRPO have advanced chain-of-thought reasoning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), yet key issues linger: (i) reliance on costly and noisy hand-curated annotations or external verifiers; (ii) flat and sparse reward schemes in GRPO; and (iii) logical inconsistency between a chain's reasoning and its final answer. We present Puzzle Curriculum GRPO (PC-GRPO), a supervision-free recipe for RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) that strengthens visual reasoning in VLMs without annotations or external verifiers. PC-GRPO replaces labels with three self-supervised puzzle environments: PatchFit, Rotation (with binary rewards) and Jigsaw (with graded partial credit mitigating reward sparsity). To counter flat rewards and vanishing group-relative advantages, we introduce a difficulty-aware curriculum that dynamically weights samples and peaks at medium difficulty. We further monitor Reasoning-Answer Consistency (RAC) during post-training: mirroring reports for vanilla GRPO in LLMs, RAC typically rises early then degrades; our curriculum delays this decline, and consistency-enforcing reward schemes further boost RAC. RAC correlates with downstream accuracy. Across diverse benchmarks and on Qwen-7B and Qwen-3B backbones, PC-GRPO improves reasoning quality, training stability, and end-task accuracy, offering a practical path to scalable, verifiable, and interpretable RL post-training for VLMs.

*Aref Farhadipour,Teodora Vukovic,Volker Dellwo,Petr Motlicek,Srikanth Madikeri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed trimodal person identification framework integrates voice, face, and gesture with robust handling of missing modalities using multi-task learning, cross-attention, gated fusion, and confidence-weighted adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world person recognition systems often face missing or degraded modalities, requiring robust solutions that can handle incomplete data while maintaining high accuracy.

Method: Multi-task learning for independent modality processing, cross-attention and gated fusion for modality interaction, and confidence-weighted fusion strategy to dynamically adapt to missing/low-quality data.

Result: Achieves 99.18% Top-1 accuracy on CANDOR dataset (first benchmark), 99.92% accuracy on VoxCeleb1 in bimodal mode, and maintains high accuracy even with missing modalities.

Conclusion: The trimodal framework provides robust person identification that works well even with modality loss, making it suitable for real-world applications where data quality varies.

Abstract: Person recognition systems often rely on audio, visual, or behavioral cues, but real-world conditions frequently result in missing or degraded modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a Trimodal person identification framework that integrates voice, face, and gesture modalities, while remaining robust to modality loss. Our approach leverages multi-task learning to process each modality independently, followed by a cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms to facilitate interaction across modalities. Moreover, a confidence-weighted fusion strategy dynamically adapts to missing and low-quality data, ensuring optimal classification even in Unimodal or Bimodal scenarios. We evaluate our method on CANDOR, a newly introduced interview-based multimodal dataset, which we benchmark for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed Trimodal system achieves 99.18% Top-1 accuracy on person identification tasks, outperforming conventional Unimodal and late-fusion approaches. In addition, we evaluate our model on the VoxCeleb1 dataset as a benchmark and reach 99.92% accuracy in Bimodal mode. Moreover, we show that our system maintains high accuracy even when one or two modalities are unavailable, making it a robust solution for real-world person recognition applications. The code and data for this work are publicly available.

### [15] [Where is the Watermark? Interpretable Watermark Detection at the Block Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14994)
*Maria Bulychev,Neil G. Marchant,Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A post-hoc image watermarking method with localized embedding and region-level interpretability that generates detection maps showing which image regions are watermarked or altered.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image watermarking schemes are black boxes that only provide global detection scores without transparency about where watermarks are located, impacting user trust and making it difficult to interpret tampering effects.

Method: Embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy, combining localized embedding with region-level interpretability to generate detection maps.

Result: Achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations, with watermarks being highly imperceptible. Robust to cropping up to half the image and offers more interpretable detection than prior post-hoc methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides transparent, interpretable watermark detection through region-level analysis while maintaining competitive robustness and imperceptibility, addressing trust and interpretability issues in current watermarking systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic digital content, raising concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse. While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness. For example, our watermarks are robust to cropping up to half the image.

*Rohit Jena,Pratik Chaudhari,James C. Gee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning methods for deformable image registration show competitive performance on in-distribution T1 MRI but suffer significant performance degradation on out-of-distribution contrasts, have scalability limitations on high-resolution data, and are sensitive to preprocessing choices, contradicting claims of universal zero-shot superiority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To independently re-evaluate claims from the LUMIR challenge about deep learning methods achieving exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen contrasts and resolutions, which contradicts established understanding of domain shift in deep learning.

Method: Performed independent re-evaluation using rigorous evaluation protocols while addressing potential sources of instrumentation bias, testing methods on various MRI contrasts (T1, T2, T2*, FLAIR) and different resolutions.

Result: (1) Deep learning performs comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1w images and macaque data; (2) Significant performance degradation on out-of-distribution contrasts (Cohen's d 0.7-1.5); (3) Scalability limitations on high-resolution data (fails on 0.6 mm isotropic); (4) High sensitivity to preprocessing choices.

Conclusion: Claims of universal zero-shot superiority require careful scrutiny. Evaluation protocols should reflect practical clinical and research workflows rather than conditions that may inadvertently favor particular method classes.

Abstract: The LUMIR challenge represents an important benchmark for evaluating deformable image registration methods on large-scale neuroimaging data. While the challenge demonstrates that modern deep learning methods achieve competitive accuracy on T1-weighted MRI, it also claims exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen contrasts and resolutions, assertions that contradict established understanding of domain shift in deep learning. In this paper, we perform an independent re-evaluation of these zero-shot claims using rigorous evaluation protocols while addressing potential sources of instrumentation bias. Our findings reveal a more nuanced picture: (1) deep learning methods perform comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1w images and even on human-adjacent species (macaque), demonstrating improved task understanding; (2) however, performance degrades significantly on out-of-distribution contrasts (T2, T2*, FLAIR), with Cohen's d scores ranging from 0.7-1.5, indicating substantial practical impact on downstream clinical workflows; (3) deep learning methods face scalability limitations on high-resolution data, failing to run on 0.6 mm isotropic images, while iterative methods benefit from increased resolution; and (4) deep methods exhibit high sensitivity to preprocessing choices. These results align with the well-established literature on domain shift and suggest that claims of universal zero-shot superiority require careful scrutiny. We advocate for evaluation protocols that reflect practical clinical and research workflows rather than conditions that may inadvertently favor particular method classes.

*Sibi Parivendan,Kashfia Sailunaz,Suresh Neethirajan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pose-based computer vision framework that distinguishes affiliative from agonistic livestock behaviors using anatomical keypoint trajectories instead of simple proximity thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current livestock monitoring systems use static proximity thresholds that cannot differentiate between positive (affiliative) and negative (agonistic) social behaviors, limiting meaningful welfare assessment in commercial farming settings.

Method: End-to-end pipeline with YOLOv11 for detection, supervised individual ID, ByteTrack for tracking, ZebraPose for 27-point keypoint estimation, and SVM classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics from keypoint trajectories.

Result: Achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative vs agonistic behaviors using pose information alone, with substantial improvements over proximity-only baselines, particularly for affiliative interactions. Near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.

Conclusion: The framework provides a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based social interaction classification that enables construction of interaction-aware social networks for precision livestock farming welfare monitoring.

Abstract: Precision livestock farming requires objective assessment of social behavior to support herd welfare monitoring, yet most existing approaches infer interactions using static proximity thresholds that cannot distinguish affiliative from agonistic behaviors in complex barn environments. This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.

*Huaying Zhang,Atsushi Hashimoto,Tosho Hirasawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new evaluation protocol for video question generation (VQG) that focuses on question quality for eliciting expert knowledge, using a question-to-answer retrieval approach with a novel EgoExoAsk dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQG evaluation focuses on answerability rather than question quality for extracting unseen knowledge from human experts. There's a need for quantitative evaluation of what makes questions effective at eliciting expert information.

Method: Proposed a protocol evaluating VQG models' ability to elicit expert knowledge by simulating QA communication using question-to-answer retrieval. Built a novel EgoExoAsk dataset (27,666 QA pairs from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary) to train the retriever, and constructed a benchmark on validation set video segments.

Result: Experimental results show the metric aligns with VQG settings: models with richer context receive better evaluations, confirming the protocol works as intended for assessing question quality in eliciting expert knowledge.

Conclusion: The proposed evaluation protocol and EgoExoAsk dataset provide a meaningful way to assess VQG model quality in generating questions that effectively extract unseen knowledge from human experts, addressing a gap in current evaluation methods.

Abstract: Skilled human interviewers can extract valuable information from experts. This raises a fundamental question: what makes some questions more effective than others? To address this, a quantitative evaluation of question-generation models is essential. Video question generation (VQG) is a topic for video question answering (VideoQA), where questions are generated for given answers. Their evaluation typically focuses on the ability to answer questions, rather than the quality of generated questions. In contrast, we focus on the question quality in eliciting unseen knowledge from human experts. For a continuous improvement of VQG models, we propose a protocol that evaluates the ability by simulating question-answering communication with experts using a question-to-answer retrieval. We obtain the retriever by constructing a novel dataset, EgoExoAsk, which comprises 27,666 QA pairs generated from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary annotation. The EgoExoAsk training set is used to obtain the retriever, and the benchmark is constructed on the validation set with Ego-Exo4D video segments. Experimental results demonstrate our metric reasonably aligns with question generation settings: models accessing richer context are evaluated better, supporting that our protocol works as intended. The EgoExoAsk dataset is available in https://github.com/omron-sinicx/VQG4ExpertKnowledge .

Conclusion: MAPO provides a scalable, model-agnostic preference optimization framework that improves segmentation quality and training stability across various medical imaging tasks without requiring ground-truth supervision.

Abstract: Preference optimization offers a scalable supervision paradigm based on relative preference signals, yet prior attempts in medical image segmentation remain model-specific and rely on low-diversity prediction sampling. In this paper, we propose MAPO (Model-Agnostic Preference Optimization), a training framework that utilizes Dropout-driven stochastic segmentation hypotheses to construct preference-consistent gradients without direct ground-truth supervision. MAPO is fully architecture- and dimensionality-agnostic, supporting 2D/3D CNN and Transformer-based segmentation pipelines.

*Kaizhe Zhang,Shinan Chen,Qian Zhao,Weizhan Zhang,Caixia Yan,Yudeng Xin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVGSR introduces a multi-view consistent super-resolution framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting that handles unstructured multi-view datasets and enhances detail fidelity through epipolar-constrained attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS super-resolution methods have limitations: single-image SR networks lack cross-view consistency, while video-based approaches require sequential frames and can't handle unstructured multi-view datasets. There's a need for a method that can integrate multi-view information for consistent, high-detail 3DGS rendering from arbitrarily organized datasets.

Method: 1) Auxiliary View Selection Method based on camera poses to handle unstructured multi-view datasets without temporal continuity requirements. 2) Epipolar-constrained multi-view attention mechanism integrated into 3DGS SR network to selectively aggregate consistent information from auxiliary views while maintaining geometric consistency.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both object-centric and scene-level 3DGS SR benchmarks, demonstrating superior detail fidelity and geometric consistency compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: MVGSR successfully addresses the limitations of previous 3DGS SR methods by providing a framework that works with unstructured multi-view datasets and enhances both detail fidelity and cross-view consistency through novel view selection and attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Scenes reconstructed by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) trained on low-resolution (LR) images are unsuitable for high-resolution (HR) rendering. Consequently, a 3DGS super-resolution (SR) method is needed to bridge LR inputs and HR rendering. Early 3DGS SR methods rely on single-image SR networks, which lack cross-view consistency and fail to fuse complementary information across views. More recent video-based SR approaches attempt to address this limitation but require strictly sequential frames, limiting their applicability to unstructured multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce Multi-View Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting Super-Resolution (MVGSR), a framework that focuses on integrating multi-view information for 3DGS rendering with high-frequency details and enhanced consistency. We first propose an Auxiliary View Selection Method based on camera poses, making our method adaptable for arbitrarily organized multi-view datasets without the need of temporal continuity or data reordering. Furthermore, we introduce, for the first time, an epipolar-constrained multi-view attention mechanism into 3DGS SR, which serves as the core of our proposed multi-view SR network. This design enables the model to selectively aggregate consistent information from auxiliary views, enhancing the geometric consistency and detail fidelity of 3DGS representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both object-centric and scene-level 3DGS SR benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using event cameras with LED markers to measure high-frequency structural deformations, overcoming limitations of traditional high-speed cameras in harsh lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional high-speed camera methods for measuring high-frequency deformations in large structures are limited by harsh lighting conditions and high equipment costs, creating a need for more practical alternatives.

Method: Uses event camera with LED markers: 1) Filters observation noise using event stream characteristics from LED blinking and spatiotemporal correlation, 2) Differentiates between motion-induced events and LED blinking events to extract high-speed moving markers, 3) Measures high-frequency planar deformations with monocular event camera.

Result: Experimental results confirm the method's accuracy in measuring high-frequency planar deformations, demonstrating successful implementation of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The event camera with LED markers approach provides an effective solution for measuring high-frequency structural deformations, overcoming limitations of traditional high-speed camera methods in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Large-scale structures suffer high-frequency deformations due to complex loads. However, harsh lighting conditions and high equipment costs limit measurement methods based on traditional high-speed cameras. This paper proposes a method to measure high-frequency deformations by exploiting an event camera and LED markers. Firstly, observation noise is filtered based on the characteristics of the event stream generated by LED markers blinking and spatiotemporal correlation. Then, LED markers are extracted from the event stream after differentiating between motion-induced events and events from LED blinking, which enables the extraction of high-speed moving LED markers. Ultimately, high-frequency planar deformations are measured by a monocular event camera. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of our method in measuring high-frequency planar deformations.

*Morgan Coe,Gruffudd Jones,Leah-Nani Alconcel,Marina Gashinova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using sequential feature detection and tracking in sub-THz ISAR images for space domain awareness, enabling robust recognition of satellite external structures through Hough transform-based feature tracking across aligned image sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With growing space debris and satellite populations, detailed Space Domain Awareness (SDA) is needed to monitor resident space objects. Space-based sensing at sub-THz frequencies offers advantages over ground-based systems by enabling closer-range inspection without atmospheric interference.

Method: The approach uses sequential ISAR image analysis with: 1) metaheuristic simulator for ISAR imagery generation, 2) affine transformations for frame-to-frame alignment, 3) gradient-by-ratio edge detection, 4) double-weighted Hough transform for linear feature detection, and 5) feature tracking across image sequences.

Result: The method demonstrates increased confidence in feature detection and classification through sequential tracking. It successfully detects shadowing as a feature and shows that feature evolution analysis across frames improves recognition accuracy of satellite external structures.

Conclusion: Sequential feature tracking in ISAR imagery enhances space domain awareness capabilities by providing more reliable detection and classification of satellite structures, with potential applications in space object monitoring and debris characterization.

Abstract: With the rapidly growing population of resident space objects (RSOs) in the near-Earth space environment, detailed information about their condition and capabilities is needed to provide Space Domain Awareness (SDA). Space-based sensing will enable inspection of RSOs at shorter ranges, independent of atmospheric effects, and from all aspects. The use of a sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging and sensing system for SDA has been proposed in previous work, demonstrating the achievement of sub-cm image resolution at ranges of up to 100 km. This work focuses on recognition of external structures by use of sequential feature detection and tracking throughout the aligned ISAR images of the satellites. The Hough transform is employed to detect linear features, which are tracked throughout the sequence. ISAR imagery is generated via a metaheuristic simulator capable of modelling encounters for a variety of deployment scenarios. Initial frame-to-frame alignment is achieved through a series of affine transformations to facilitate later association between image features. A gradient-by-ratio method is used for edge detection within individual ISAR images, and edge magnitude and direction are subsequently used to inform a double-weighted Hough transform to detect features with high accuracy. Feature evolution during sequences of frames is analysed. It is shown that the use of feature tracking within sequences with the proposed approach will increase confidence in feature detection and classification, and an example use-case of robust detection of shadowing as a feature is presented.

TL;DR: MWNet: Memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network for ultrasound video segmentation, addressing low contrast, noisy backgrounds, and object tracking in long videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical ultrasound videos have low contrast and noisy backgrounds causing missegmentation of organ boundaries, small object losses, and boundary errors. Object tracking in long videos is also challenging for computer-assisted surgery workflows.

Method: Encoder-decoder network with memory-based wavelet convolution to capture category details and adjacent information. Cascaded wavelet compression fuses multiscale frequency features. Long short-term memory bank with cross-attention tracks objects in long videos. HF-aware feature fusion module uses adaptive wavelet filters for boundary-sensitive details.

Result: Extensive tests on four ultrasound datasets (thyroid nodule, thyroid gland, heart) show marked improvements in segmentation metrics compared to SOTA methods. Particularly effective for small thyroid nodule segmentation in long videos.

Conclusion: MWNet effectively addresses ultrasound video segmentation challenges by integrating wavelet filtering, memory mechanisms, and frequency-domain features, demonstrating superior performance especially for small objects in long videos.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound videos are widely used for medical inspections, disease diagnosis and surgical planning. High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics. In particular, our method can more accurately segment small thyroid nodules, demonstrating its effectiveness for cases involving small ultrasound objects in long video.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether commercial text-to-image models like Nano Banana Pro can serve as generalist solvers for traditional low-level vision tasks, which remains largely underexplored despite their popularity.

Method: Conducted comprehensive zero-shot evaluation across 14 distinct low-level vision tasks spanning 40 diverse datasets using simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, benchmarking against state-of-the-art specialist models.

Result: Revealed a performance dichotomy: Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality (often hallucinating plausible high-frequency details that surpass specialist models) but lags behind in traditional reference-based quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: Nano Banana Pro is a capable zero-shot contender for low-level vision tasks, but achieving the high fidelity of domain specialists remains challenging due to the inherent stochasticity of generative models that struggle with pixel-level consistency.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of text-to-image generation models has revolutionized visual content creation. While commercial products like Nano Banana Pro have garnered significant attention, their potential as generalist solvers for traditional low-level vision challenges remains largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate the critical question: Is Nano Banana Pro a Low-Level Vision All-Rounder? We conducted a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation across 14 distinct low-level tasks spanning 40 diverse datasets. By utilizing simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, we benchmarked Nano Banana Pro against state-of-the-art specialist models. Our extensive analysis reveals a distinct performance dichotomy: while \textbf{Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality}, often hallucinating plausible high-frequency details that surpass specialist models, it lags behind in traditional reference-based quantitative metrics. We attribute this discrepancy to the inherent stochasticity of generative models, which struggle to maintain the strict pixel-level consistency required by conventional metrics. This report identifies Nano Banana Pro as a capable zero-shot contender for low-level vision tasks, while highlighting that achieving the high fidelity of domain specialists remains a significant hurdle.

TL;DR: A lightweight 3D animation framework that decouples geometric control from appearance synthesis using a 2D-3D aligned proxy representation, enabling efficient animation generation with 3D controllability on low-power platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D animation pipelines are labor-intensive, expertise-demanding, and computationally expensive. Recent AIGC approaches either inherit heavy 3D pipeline costs or sacrifice 3D controllability by relying on video synthesis. There's a fundamental trade-off between rendering quality and 3D control in single-image 3D animation generation.

Method: Proposes a lightweight framework using a 2D-3D aligned proxy representation: a coarse 3D estimate serves as structural carrier while delegating high-fidelity appearance and view synthesis to learned image-space generative priors. This decouples geometric control from appearance synthesis, enabling 3D-aware motion control without accurate geometry or expensive optimization.

Result: Achieves efficient animation generation on low-power platforms, outperforms video-based 3D animation methods in identity preservation, geometric/textural consistency, and precise interactive control. Naturally extends to coherent background animation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the quality-control trade-off in 3D animation by decoupling geometry and appearance, offering 3D controllability comparable to classical pipelines while maintaining efficiency and quality, making 3D animation more accessible and practical.

Abstract: 3D animation is central to modern visual media, yet traditional production pipelines remain labor-intensive, expertise-demanding, and computationally expensive. Recent AIGC-based approaches partially automate asset creation and rigging, but they either inherit the heavy costs of full 3D pipelines or rely on video-synthesis paradigms that sacrifice 3D controllability and interactivity. We focus on single-image 3D animation generation and argue that progress is fundamentally constrained by a trade-off between rendering quality and 3D control.
  To address this limitation, we propose a lightweight 3D animation framework that decouples geometric control from appearance synthesis. The core idea is a 2D-3D aligned proxy representation that uses a coarse 3D estimate as a structural carrier, while delegating high-fidelity appearance and view synthesis to learned image-space generative priors. This proxy formulation enables 3D-aware motion control and interaction comparable to classical pipelines, without requiring accurate geometry or expensive optimization, and naturally extends to coherent background animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves efficient animation generation on low-power platforms and outperforms video-based 3D animation generation in identity preservation, geometric and textural consistency, and the level of precise, interactive control it offers to users.

*Shengxiao Zhou,Chenghua Li,Jianhao Huang,Qinghao Hu,Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENIE is a framework for reference-guided instance editing that disentangles intrinsic appearance from extrinsic attributes to achieve better editing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reference-guided instance editing methods suffer from semantic entanglement where a reference's intrinsic appearance (what should be borrowed) is intertwined with extrinsic attributes (context-specific features), making it difficult to properly transfer appearance while preserving target structure.

Method: GENIE uses three modules: 1) Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) to correct spatial misalignments, 2) Adaptive Residual Scaling Module (ARSM) to learn what to borrow by amplifying intrinsic cues while suppressing extrinsic attributes, and 3) Progressive Attention Fusion (PAF) to learn how to render appearance onto the target while preserving its structure.

Result: Extensive experiments on the challenging AnyInsertion dataset show that GENIE achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and robustness, setting a new standard for disentanglement-based instance editing.

Conclusion: GENIE successfully addresses the semantic entanglement problem in reference-guided instance editing through explicit disentanglement of intrinsic and extrinsic attributes, enabling more accurate and robust appearance transfer while preserving target structure.

Abstract: Reference-guided instance editing is fundamentally limited by semantic entanglement, where a reference's intrinsic appearance is intertwined with its extrinsic attributes. The key challenge lies in disentangling what information should be borrowed from the reference, and determining how to apply it appropriately to the target. To tackle this challenge, we propose GENIE, a Generalizable Instance Editing framework capable of achieving explicit disentanglement. GENIE first corrects spatial misalignments with a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM). Then, an Adaptive Residual Scaling Module (ARSM) learns what to borrow by amplifying salient intrinsic cues while suppressing extrinsic attributes, while a Progressive Attention Fusion (PAF) mechanism learns how to render this appearance onto the target, preserving its structure. Extensive experiments on the challenging AnyInsertion dataset demonstrate that GENIE achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and robustness, setting a new standard for disentanglement-based instance editing.

### [29] [Explainable Action Form Assessment by Exploiting Multimodal Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15153)
*Mengshi Qi,Yeteng Wu,Xianlin Zhang,Huadong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task is introduced with CoT-AFA dataset for evaluating action standardization, featuring Chain-of-Thought explanations and an Explainable Fitness Assessor framework that improves explanation generation and assessment accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video understanding methods only identify what and where actions occur, lacking assessment of action standardization quality. Existing datasets lack labels for action standardization degree, and action quality assessment datasets lack explainability and detailed feedback.

Method: 1) Define Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task; 2) Create CoT-AFA dataset with fitness/martial arts videos and multi-level annotations; 3) Introduce Chain-of-Thought explanation paradigm providing complete reasoning process; 4) Propose Explainable Fitness Assessor framework with parallel processing streams and dynamic gating mechanism to fuse visual and semantic information.

Result: Achieved improvements: +16.0% in CIDEr for explanation generation, +2.7% in accuracy for action classification, and +2.1% in accuracy for quality assessment. Demonstrates great potential of CoT-AFA for future studies.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel AFA task and CoT-AFA dataset with Chain-of-Thought explanations, enabling comprehensive assessment of action standardization with explainable feedback. The proposed framework shows significant improvements across multiple metrics.

Abstract: Evaluating whether human action is standard or not and providing reasonable feedback to improve action standardization is very crucial but challenging in real-world scenarios. However, current video understanding methods are mainly concerned with what and where the action is, which is unable to meet the requirements. Meanwhile, most of the existing datasets lack the labels indicating the degree of action standardization, and the action quality assessment datasets lack explainability and detailed feedback. Therefore, we define a new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task, and introduce a new diverse dataset CoT-AFA, which contains a large scale of fitness and martial arts videos with multi-level annotations for comprehensive video analysis. We enrich the CoT-AFA dataset with a novel Chain-of-Thought explanation paradigm. Instead of offering isolated feedback, our explanations provide a complete reasoning process--from identifying an action step to analyzing its outcome and proposing a concrete solution. Furthermore, we propose a framework named Explainable Fitness Assessor, which can not only judge an action but also explain why and provide a solution. This framework employs two parallel processing streams and a dynamic gating mechanism to fuse visual and semantic information, thereby boosting its analytical capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has achieved improvements in explanation generation (e.g., +16.0% in CIDEr), action classification (+2.7% in accuracy) and quality assessment (+2.1% in accuracy), revealing great potential of CoT-AFA for future studies.

### [30] [EagleVision: A Dual-Stage Framework with BEV-grounding-based Chain-of-Thought for Spatial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15160)
*Jiaxu Wan,Xu Wang,Mengwei Xie,Hang Zhang,Mu Xu,Yang Han,Hong Zhang,Ding Yuan,Yifan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EagleVision is a dual-stage framework for spatial reasoning that uses macro perception to select keyframes and micro verification for spatial Chain-of-Thought through BEV-grounded pose querying with reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial intelligence approaches have weak spatial consistency, limited viewpoint diversity, and untraceable evidence chains. Current "thinking with images" frameworks don't address key challenges in spatial Chain-of-Thought: building global space perception under token budgets, associating 3D hypotheses with video frames, and designing spatially grounded rewards for RL.

Method: Dual-stage framework: 1) Macro perception uses SPF-DPP to select compact geometry- and semantics-aware keyframes from long videos under fixed token budget. 2) Micro verification formalizes spatial CoT as BEV-grounded pose querying - agent iteratively predicts poses on BEV plane, retrieves nearest real frames, trained purely by RL with spatial grounding reward scoring consistency between predicted poses and observed views.

Result: On VSI-Bench, EagleVision achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source vision-language models, demonstrating strong and generalizable spatial understanding.

Conclusion: EagleVision addresses key challenges in spatial reasoning through its dual-stage approach of macro perception and micro verification, enabling progressive spatial cognition with traceable evidence chains and strong spatial consistency.

Abstract: Recent spatial intelligence approaches typically attach 3D cues to 2D reasoning pipelines or couple MLLMs with black-box reconstruction modules, leading to weak spatial consistency, limited viewpoint diversity, and evidence chains that cannot be traced back to supporting views. Frameworks for "thinking with images" (e.g., ChatGPT-o3 and DeepEyes) show that stepwise multimodal reasoning can emerge by interleaving hypothesis formation with active acquisition of visual evidence, but they do not address three key challenges in spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT): building global space perception under strict token budgets, explicitly associating 3D hypotheses with video frames for verification, and designing spatially grounded rewards for reinforcement learning. To address these issues, we present EagleVision, a dual-stage framework for progressive spatial cognition through macro perception and micro verification. In the macro perception stage, EagleVision employs a semantics-perspective-fusion determinantal point process (SPF-DPP) to select a compact set of geometry- and semantics-aware keyframes from long videos under a fixed token budget. In the micro verification stage, we formalize spatial CoT as BEV-grounded pose querying: the agent iteratively predicts poses on a BEV plane, retrieves the nearest real frames, and is trained purely by reinforcement learning with a spatial grounding reward that scores the consistency between predicted poses and observed views. On VSI-Bench, EagleVision achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source vision-language models, demonstrating strong and generalizable spatial understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CMUS-Net: A cross-modal ultra-scale learning network for multi-modal glomerular disease classification using TEM, OM, and IM images, addressing nanometer-to-micrometer scale differences with sparse multi-instance learning and cross-modal scale attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal classification using renal biopsy images (TEM, OM, IM) can assist pathologists in glomerular disease identification, but existing models struggle with feature fusion due to the huge scale difference between nanometer-scale TEM features and micrometer-scale OM/IM images.

Method: CMUS-Net uses multiple ultrastructural information to bridge nanometer-micrometer scale differences. It includes: 1) sparse multi-instance learning module to aggregate TEM image features, 2) cross-modal scale attention module for feature interaction and pathological semantic enhancement, and 3) combined multiple loss functions to weigh modality importance.

Result: Achieves 95.37±2.41% ACC, 99.05±0.53% AUC, and 95.32±2.41% F1-score on in-house dataset for classifying IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and lupus nephritis. Outperforms other multi-modal/multi-scale methods and shows generalization in MN staging.

Conclusion: CMUS-Net effectively addresses scale differences in multi-modal renal biopsy analysis, achieving state-of-the-art performance for automated glomerular disease classification and demonstrating potential for clinical pathology assistance.

Abstract: Constructing a multi-modal automatic classification model based on three types of renal biopsy images can assist pathologists in glomerular multi-disease identification. However, the substantial scale difference between transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image features at the nanoscale and optical microscopy (OM) or immunofluorescence microscopy (IM) images at the microscale poses a challenge for existing multi-modal and multi-scale models in achieving effective feature fusion and improving classification accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a cross-modal ultra-scale learning network (CMUS-Net) for the auxiliary diagnosis of multiple glomerular diseases. CMUS-Net utilizes multiple ultrastructural information to bridge the scale difference between nanometer and micrometer images. Specifically, we introduce a sparse multi-instance learning module to aggregate features from TEM images. Furthermore, we design a cross-modal scale attention module to facilitate feature interaction, enhancing pathological semantic information. Finally, multiple loss functions are combined, allowing the model to weigh the importance among different modalities and achieve precise classification of glomerular diseases. Our method follows the conventional process of renal biopsy pathology diagnosis and, for the first time, performs automatic classification of multiple glomerular diseases including IgA nephropathy (IgAN), membranous nephropathy (MN), and lupus nephritis (LN) based on images from three modalities and two scales. On an in-house dataset, CMUS-Net achieves an ACC of 95.37+/-2.41%, an AUC of 99.05+/-0.53%, and an F1-score of 95.32+/-2.41%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CMUS-Net outperforms other well-known multi-modal or multi-scale methods and show its generalization capability in staging MN.

TL;DR: First comprehensive analysis of criticality metrics for safety evaluation of object detection in automated driving, proposing novel strategies that achieve up to 100% improvement in criticality classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current perception evaluation metrics lack safety-specific focus, making it difficult to distinguish between relevant and non-relevant objects for safety-critical decision making in automated vehicles.

Method: Comprehensive literature review to identify applicable criticality metrics, empirical validation using DeepAccident dataset with safety-critical scenarios, and proposal of two novel strategies: bidirectional criticality rating and multi-metric aggregation.

Result: The approach demonstrates up to 100% improvement in criticality classification accuracy compared to existing methods, significantly enhancing safety evaluation capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed criticality metrics and application strategies represent a significant advancement for safety evaluation of object detection systems in automated vehicles, addressing a crucial gap in current perception assessment methods.

Abstract: Ensuring safety is the primary objective of automated driving, which necessitates a comprehensive and accurate perception of the environment. While numerous performance evaluation metrics exist for assessing perception capabilities, incorporating safety-specific metrics is essential to reliably evaluate object detection systems. A key component for safety evaluation is the ability to distinguish between relevant and non-relevant objects - a challenge addressed by criticality or relevance metrics. This paper presents the first in-depth analysis of criticality metrics for safety evaluation of object detection systems. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify and assess a range of applicable metrics. Their effectiveness is empirically validated using the DeepAccident dataset, which features a variety of safety-critical scenarios. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we propose two novel application strategies: bidirectional criticality rating and multi-metric aggregation. Our approach demonstrates up to a 100% improvement in terms of criticality classification accuracy, highlighting its potential to significantly advance the safety evaluation of object detection systems in automated vehicles.

TL;DR: A resynthesis framework for deepfake detection that focuses on high-precision verification of authentic samples while maintaining low false positive rates and achieving adversarial robustness against compute-restricted adversaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable because (i) distinguishing inauthentic content post-hoc is often impossible (leading to unbounded false positive rates), and (ii) detection lacks robustness as adversaries can easily adapt to known detectors with minimal computational resources.

Method: Proposes a resynthesis framework to determine if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied. Uses calibrated resynthesis method focusing on high-precision, low-recall setting against compute-restricted adversaries. Supports multiple modalities and leverages state-of-the-art inversion techniques.

Result: The calibrated resynthesis method is the most reliable approach for verifying authentic samples while maintaining controllable low false positive rates. The method achieves adversarial robustness against efficient adversaries, whereas prior methods are easily evaded under identical compute budgets.

Conclusion: The proposed resynthesis framework addresses fundamental limitations of current deepfake detection by providing reliable verification of authentic content with controlled false positive rates and robust defense against computationally efficient adversaries.

Abstract: Generative models can synthesize highly realistic content, so-called deepfakes, that are already being misused at scale to undermine digital media authenticity. Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable for two reasons: (i) distinguishing inauthentic content post-hoc is often impossible (e.g., with memorized samples), leading to an unbounded false positive rate (FPR); and (ii) detection lacks robustness, as adversaries can adapt to known detectors with near-perfect accuracy using minimal computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a resynthesis framework to determine if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied. We make two key contributions focusing on the high-precision, low-recall setting against efficient (i.e., compute-restricted) adversaries. First, we demonstrate that our calibrated resynthesis method is the most reliable approach for verifying authentic samples while maintaining controllable, low FPRs. Second, we show that our method achieves adversarial robustness against efficient adversaries, whereas prior methods are easily evaded under identical compute budgets. Our approach supports multiple modalities and leverages state-of-the-art inversion techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAW-based low-light enhancement methods are computationally heavy due to sequential multi-scale processing and fail to leverage the superior information in green channels of RAW images.

Method: Proposes ERIENet with: 1) Efficient multi-scale fully-parallel architecture with channel-aware residual dense blocks for feature extraction, 2) Green channel guidance branch to exploit rich green channel information for better reconstruction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on low-light RAW image enhancement datasets, achieves over 146 FPS for 4K-resolution images on RTX 3090 GPU, with higher efficiency and better reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: ERIENet provides an efficient solution for real-time RAW image enhancement by combining parallel multi-scale processing with green channel guidance, achieving superior performance with high processing speeds.

Abstract: RAW images have shown superior performance than sRGB images in many image processing tasks, especially for low-light image enhancement. However, most existing methods for RAW-based low-light enhancement usually sequentially process multi-scale information, which makes it difficult to achieve lightweight models and high processing speeds. Besides, they usually ignore the green channel superiority of RAW images, and fail to achieve better reconstruction performance with good use of green channel information. In this work, we propose an efficient RAW Image Enhancement Network (ERIENet), which parallelly processes multi-scale information with efficient convolution modules, and takes advantage of rich information in green channels to guide the reconstruction of images. Firstly, we introduce an efficient multi-scale fully-parallel architecture with a novel channel-aware residual dense block to extract feature maps, which reduces computational costs and achieves real-time processing speed. Secondly, we introduce a green channel guidance branch to exploit the rich information within the green channels of the input RAW image. It increases the quality of reconstruction results with few parameters and computations. Experiments on commonly used low-light image enhancement datasets show that ERIENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing low-light RAW images with higher effiency. It also achieves an optimal speed of over 146 frame-per-second (FPS) for 4K-resolution images on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 with 24G memory.

*Yufeng Xie*

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new Target-Background Contrast (TBC) metric for infrared and visible image fusion in UAV reconnaissance, addressing the "Noise Trap" problem where traditional metrics incorrectly reward noisy images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional no-reference metrics like Entropy (EN) and Average Gradient (AG) fail in complex low-light UAV reconnaissance environments. They misinterpret high-frequency sensor noise as valid detail, creating a "Noise Trap" that paradoxically assigns higher scores to noisy images and misguides fusion algorithms.

Method: The authors propose the Target-Background Contrast (TBC) metric, inspired by Weber's Law. Unlike traditional global statistics-based metrics, TBC focuses on the relative contrast of salient targets, penalizing background noise while rewarding target visibility.

Result: Experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that TBC aligns better with human perception and provides a reliable evaluation standard for low-altitude UAV reconnaissance scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed TBC metric effectively addresses the limitations of traditional no-reference metrics in low-light UAV environments by focusing on target-background contrast rather than global statistics, providing a more reliable evaluation standard for infrared and visible image fusion.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion is a pivotal technology in low-altitude UAV reconnaissance missions, providing high-quality data support for downstream tasks such as target detection and tracking by integrating thermal saliency with background texture details.However, traditional no-reference metrics fail(Specifically,like Entropy (EN) and Average Gradient (AG)) in complex low-light environments. They often misinterpret high-frequency sensor noise as valid detail. This creates a "Noise Trap," paradoxically assigning higher scores to noisy images and misguiding fusion algorithms.To address this, we propose the Target-Background Contrast (TBC) metric. Inspired by Weber's Law, TBC focuses on the relative contrast of salient targets rather than global statistics. Unlike traditional metrics, TBC penalizes background noise and rewards target visibility. Experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that TBC aligns better with human perception and provides a reliable standard for low-altitude scenarios.

TL;DR: Mesh-Plug: A plug-and-play module that transforms human meshes from camera coordinates to world coordinates by estimating camera rotation from human body cues rather than environmental features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human mesh reconstruction methods assume zero camera rotation, which works in camera coordinates but causes significant errors when transforming to world coordinates. The lack of camera rotation information for in-the-wild images makes accurate world coordinate reconstruction challenging.

Method: Proposes a human-centered approach using both RGB images and depth maps from initial mesh. First trains a camera rotation prediction module focusing on human body spatial configuration to estimate camera pitch angle. Then integrates predicted camera parameters with initial mesh in a mesh adjustment module that simultaneously refines root joint orientation and body pose.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets SPEC-SYN and SPEC-MTP, demonstrating effective transformation from camera to world coordinates.

Conclusion: Mesh-Plug provides an effective solution for accurate 3D human mesh reconstruction in world coordinates by eliminating dependency on environmental cues and focusing on human body information for camera rotation estimation.

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate 3D human meshes in the world coordinate system from in-the-wild images remains challenging due to the lack of camera rotation information. While existing methods achieve promising results in the camera coordinate system by assuming zero camera rotation, this simplification leads to significant errors when transforming the reconstructed mesh to the world coordinate system. To address this challenge, we propose Mesh-Plug, a plug-and-play module that accurately transforms human meshes from camera coordinates to world coordinates. Our key innovation lies in a human-centered approach that leverages both RGB images and depth maps rendered from the initial mesh to estimate camera rotation parameters, eliminating the dependency on environmental cues. Specifically, we first train a camera rotation prediction module that focuses on the human body's spatial configuration to estimate camera pitch angle. Then, by integrating the predicted camera parameters with the initial mesh, we design a mesh adjustment module that simultaneously refines the root joint orientation and body pose. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets SPEC-SYN and SPEC-MTP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lens flare removal methods fail to effectively handle nonuniform scattered flares in complex real-world nighttime scenarios with diverse lighting conditions, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: Proposes SLCFormer with two key modules: 1) Frequency Fourier and Excitation Module (FFEM) for global contextual representations in frequency domain, and 2) Directionally-Enhanced Spatial Module (DESM) for local structural enhancement in spatial domain. Also introduces ZernikeVAE-based scatter flare generation pipeline for physically realistic training data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Flare7K++ dataset, outperforming existing approaches in both quantitative metrics and perceptual visual quality, with robust generalization to real nighttime scenes with complex flare artifacts.

Conclusion: SLCFormer effectively addresses nonuniform scattered flares in complex nighttime scenarios through its spectral-local context transformer design, demonstrating superior flare removal capability and practical applicability to real-world conditions.

Abstract: Lens flare is a common nighttime artifact caused by strong light sources scattering within camera lenses, leading to hazy streaks, halos, and glare that degrade visual quality. However, existing methods usually fail to effectively address nonuniform scattered flares, which severely reduces their applicability to complex real-world scenarios with diverse lighting conditions. To address this issue, we propose SLCFormer, a novel spectral-local context transformer framework for effective nighttime lens flare removal. SLCFormer integrates two key modules: the Frequency Fourier and Excitation Module (FFEM), which captures efficient global contextual representations in the frequency domain to model flare characteristics, and the Directionally-Enhanced Spatial Module (DESM) for local structural enhancement and directional features in the spatial domain for precise flare removal. Furthermore, we introduce a ZernikeVAE-based scatter flare generation pipeline to synthesize physically realistic scatter flares with spatially varying PSFs, bridging optical physics and data-driven training. Extensive experiments on the Flare7K++ dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches in both quantitative metrics and perceptual visual quality, and generalizing robustly to real nighttime scenes with complex flare artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA perform adaptation over the full parameter space, but fine-tuning within a subspace can achieve comparable effectiveness. The observation that pre-trained models possess non-trivial null spaces inspires a more efficient approach.

Method: Null-LoRA performs low-rank adaptation within the null space of pre-trained models by freezing portions of low-rank matrices to reduce redundancy and enhance effective rank. It constrains the entire incremental update within the null space to maximize utilization of incremental updates for adapting to new tasks.

Result: Null-LoRA surpasses state-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters in extensive experiments across image-text retrieval and visual question answering tasks.

Conclusion: Null-space based adaptation provides a more parameter-efficient approach to fine-tuning large-scale models, achieving better performance with fewer parameters by leveraging the inherent null spaces in pre-trained models.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have gained considerable popularity for adapting large-scale models to downstream tasks, particularly LoRA and its variants. Existing methods perform low-rank adaptation over the full parameter space. However, fine-tuning within a subspace can achieve comparable effectiveness. Inspired by the observation that pre-trained models possess non-trivial null spaces, we propose Null-space based Low-Rank Adaptation (Null-LoRA). Null-LoRA effectively reduces redundancy and enhances effective rank by freezing portions of the low-rank matrices. To further improve parameter efficiency, Null-LoRA constrains the entire incremental update within the null space, maximizing the utilization of incremental updates to adapt to new task paradigms. Null-LoRA surpasses the state of the art with fewer parameters in extensive experiments across image-text retrieval and visual question answering tasks.

TL;DR: CMAC-MMD framework reduces intersectional bias in medical AI by standardizing diagnostic certainty across patient subgroups without requiring demographic data during inference, improving both fairness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical AI systems exhibit intersectional biases where models are less confident in diagnosing marginalized patient subgroups, leading to inaccurate/missed diagnoses. Current fairness interventions often fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance.

Method: Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD) training framework that standardizes diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference.

Result: In dermatology: reduced intersectional missed diagnosis gap (ΔTPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving AUC from 0.94 to 0.97. In glaucoma screening: reduced ΔTPR from 0.41 to 0.31 with AUC improvement from 0.71 to 0.72.

Conclusion: Establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and equitable across diverse patient subgroups without increasing privacy risks.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly multimodal vision-language models (VLM), often exhibit intersectional biases where models are systematically less confident in diagnosing marginalised patient subgroups. Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $Δ$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $Δ$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline). This establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and can perform equitably across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks.

Motivation: Traditional counting methods rely on domain-specific architectures trained on predefined object categories, while large-scale multimodal vision-language models offer potential as flexible alternatives for open-set object counting.

Method: Systematic comparison of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets plus a novel benchmark with finer-grained control over visual properties.

Result: Most VLMs can approximately enumerate items in visual scenes, matching or surpassing specialized architectures. Accuracy significantly improves when VLMs generate intermediate representations (locations and verbal labels) of each object.

Conclusion: While VLMs show promise for object counting, none can reliably count objects in complex visual scenes, indicating need for further research to create AI systems that can deploy counting procedures in realistic environments.

Abstract: Counting the number of items in a visual scene remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision. Traditional approaches to solving this problem rely on domain-specific counting architectures, which are trained using datasets annotated with a predefined set of object categories. However, recent progress in creating large-scale multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) suggests that these domain-general architectures may offer a flexible alternative for open-set object counting. In this study, we therefore systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets, as well as on a novel benchmark specifically created to have a finer-grained control over the visual properties of test images. Our findings show that most VLMs can approximately enumerate the number of items in a visual scene, matching or even surpassing the performance of specialized computer vision architectures. Notably, enumeration accuracy significantly improves when VLMs are prompted to generate intermediate representations (i.e., locations and verbal labels) of each object to be counted. Nevertheless, none of the models can reliably count the number of objects in complex visual scenes, showing that further research is still needed to create AI systems that can reliably deploy counting procedures in realistic environments.

TL;DR: MMMamba: A cross-modal in-context fusion framework for pan-sharpening using Mamba architecture with multimodal interleaved scanning, achieving linear computational complexity and superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNN-based pan-sharpening methods have limited adaptability to diverse spatial/spectral variations, while cross-attention mechanisms are computationally inefficient and may dilute fine-grained correspondences. There's a need for more efficient and effective cross-modal fusion approaches.

Method: Proposes MMMamba, a cross-modal in-context fusion framework built on Mamba architecture. Uses in-context conditioning instead of cross-attention for direct/efficient cross-modal exchange. Introduces novel multimodal interleaved (MI) scanning mechanism for effective PAN-MS information exchange. Supports zero-shot image super-resolution.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple tasks and benchmarks. Achieves linear computational complexity while maintaining strong cross-modal interaction capacity.

Conclusion: MMMamba provides an effective and efficient solution for pan-sharpening with linear computational complexity, outperforming existing methods through innovative cross-modal in-context fusion and multimodal interleaved scanning.

Abstract: Pan-sharpening aims to generate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images by integrating a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with its corresponding low-resolution multispectral (MS) image. To achieve effective fusion, it is crucial to fully exploit the complementary information between the two modalities. Traditional CNN-based methods typically rely on channel-wise concatenation with fixed convolutional operators, which limits their adaptability to diverse spatial and spectral variations. While cross-attention mechanisms enable global interactions, they are computationally inefficient and may dilute fine-grained correspondences, making it difficult to capture complex semantic relationships. Recent advances in the Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture have demonstrated impressive success in image generation and editing tasks. Unlike cross-attention, MMDiT employs in-context conditioning to facilitate more direct and efficient cross-modal information exchange. In this paper, we propose MMMamba, a cross-modal in-context fusion framework for pan-sharpening, with the flexibility to support image super-resolution in a zero-shot manner. Built upon the Mamba architecture, our design ensures linear computational complexity while maintaining strong cross-modal interaction capacity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal interleaved (MI) scanning mechanism that facilitates effective information exchange between the PAN and MS modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques across multiple tasks and benchmarks.

TL;DR: SynthSeg Agents: A multi-agent LLM framework that generates synthetic training data for Zero-Shot Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation without any real images, achieving competitive performance on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WSSS methods still depend on real-world training samples even when using generative models. The paper introduces ZSWSSS to eliminate this dependency entirely, aiming for cost-efficient and scalable semantic segmentation without real image supervision.

Method: Two-agent framework: 1) Self-Refine Prompt Agent uses LLMs to iteratively craft diverse image prompts via refinement, memory, and exploration with CLIP-based similarity and diversity filtering; 2) Image Generation Agent uses VLMs to synthesize images from prompts, with CLIP scoring for quality selection and ViT classifier for improved semantic relabeling.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO 2014 benchmarks without using any real training images, demonstrating the viability of LLM-driven synthetic data generation for semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: SynthSeg Agents successfully enables Zero-Shot Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven agents for cost-efficient and scalable semantic segmentation without real image supervision.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image level labels aims to produce pixel level predictions without requiring dense annotations. While recent approaches have leveraged generative models to augment existing data, they remain dependent on real world training samples. In this paper, we introduce a novel direction, Zero Shot Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (ZSWSSS), and propose SynthSeg Agents, a multi agent framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data entirely without real images. SynthSeg Agents comprises two key modules, a Self Refine Prompt Agent and an Image Generation Agent. The Self Refine Prompt Agent autonomously crafts diverse and semantically rich image prompts via iterative refinement, memory mechanisms, and prompt space exploration, guided by CLIP based similarity and nearest neighbor diversity filtering. These prompts are then passed to the Image Generation Agent, which leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to synthesize candidate images. A frozen CLIP scoring model is employed to select high quality samples, and a ViT based classifier is further trained to relabel the entire synthetic dataset with improved semantic precision. Our framework produces high quality training data without any real image supervision. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO 2014 show that SynthSeg Agents achieves competitive performance without using real training images. This highlights the potential of LLM driven agents in enabling cost efficient and scalable semantic segmentation.

Abstract: We present the first cross-modality distillation framework specifically tailored for single-panoramic-camera Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) segmentation. Our approach leverages a novel LiDAR image representation fused from range, intensity and ambient channels, together with a voxel-aligned view transformer that preserves spatial fidelity while enabling efficient BEV processing. During training, a high-capacity LiDAR and camera fusion Teacher network extracts both rich spatial and semantic features for cross-modality knowledge distillation into a lightweight Student network that relies solely on a single 360-degree panoramic camera image. Extensive experiments on the Dur360BEV dataset demonstrate that our teacher model significantly outperforms existing camera-based BEV segmentation methods, achieving a 25.6\% IoU improvement. Meanwhile, the distilled Student network attains competitive performance with an 8.5\% IoU gain and state-of-the-art inference speed of 31.2 FPS. Moreover, evaluations on KITTI-360 (two fisheye cameras) confirm that our distillation framework generalises to diverse camera setups, underscoring its feasibility and robustness.

*Antony Jerald,Dattesh Shanbhag,Sudhanya Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoMAC-MRI is an explainable framework for grading motion artifacts in MRI using supervised contrastive learning and grade-specific affinity scores for interpretable quality assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion artifacts degrade MRI quality and increase patient recalls, but existing automated quality assessment methods are limited to binary decisions with little interpretability.

Method: Uses supervised contrastive learning to learn discriminative representations of motion severity, then computes grade-specific affinity scores that quantify an image's proximity to each motion grade for transparent grade assignment.

Result: Evaluated on 5000+ expert-annotated brain MRI slices across multiple contrasts and views; affinity scores align well with expert judgment, supporting their use as interpretable measures of motion severity.

Conclusion: AutoMAC-MRI enables inline MRI quality control with accurate grade detection and interpretable affinity scoring, potentially reducing unnecessary rescans and improving workflow efficiency.

Abstract: Motion artifacts degrade MRI image quality and increase patient recalls. Existing automated quality assessment methods are largely limited to binary decisions and provide little interpretability. We introduce AutoMAC-MRI, an explainable framework for grading motion artifacts across heterogeneous MR contrasts and orientations. The approach uses supervised contrastive learning to learn a discriminative representation of motion severity. Within this feature space, we compute grade-specific affinity scores that quantify an image's proximity to each motion grade, thereby making grade assignments transparent and interpretable. We evaluate AutoMAC-MRI on more than 5000 expert-annotated brain MRI slices spanning multiple contrasts and views. Experiments assessing affinity scores against expert labels show that the scores align well with expert judgment, supporting their use as an interpretable measure of motion severity. By coupling accurate grade detection with per-grade affinity scoring, AutoMAC-MRI enables inline MRI quality control, with the potential to reduce unnecessary rescans and improve workflow efficiency.

*Yuxin Jiang,Yunkang Cao,Weiming Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCSNet improves few-shot anomaly detection by addressing domain gaps between pre-trained features and target scenarios using prototypical learning and context-aware segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSAD methods rely on pre-trained features but overlook domain gaps between these representations and target scenarios, limiting performance.

Method: PCSNet uses two sub-networks: Prototypical Feature Adaption (PFA) for better feature compactness and separation, and Context-Aware Segmentation (CAS) for pixel-level anomaly localization with pseudo anomalies for training.

Result: Achieves 94.9% and 80.2% image-level AUROC on MVTec and MPDD in 8-shot scenarios, with promising results in real-world automotive plastic part inspection.

Conclusion: PCSNet effectively addresses domain gaps in FSAD, improving feature descriptiveness and achieving superior performance with limited training samples.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) denotes the identification of anomalies within a target category with a limited number of normal samples. Existing FSAD methods largely rely on pre-trained feature representations to detect anomalies, but the inherent domain gap between pre-trained representations and target FSAD scenarios is often overlooked. This study proposes a Prototypical Learning Guided Context-Aware Segmentation Network (PCSNet) to address the domain gap, thereby improving feature descriptiveness in target scenarios and enhancing FSAD performance. In particular, PCSNet comprises a prototypical feature adaption (PFA) sub-network and a context-aware segmentation (CAS) sub-network. PFA extracts prototypical features as guidance to ensure better feature compactness for normal data while distinct separation from anomalies. A pixel-level disparity classification loss is also designed to make subtle anomalies more distinguishable. Then a CAS sub-network is introduced for pixel-level anomaly localization, where pseudo anomalies are exploited to facilitate the training process. Experimental results on MVTec and MPDD demonstrate the superior FSAD performance of PCSNet, with 94.9% and 80.2% image-level AUROC in an 8-shot scenario, respectively. Real-world applications on automotive plastic part inspection further demonstrate that PCSNet can achieve promising results with limited training samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRKD introduces masked reverse knowledge distillation with image-level and feature-level masking to prevent overgeneralization in anomaly detection, achieving state-of-the-art results on MVTec dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge distillation for anomaly detection suffers from overgeneralization due to similarities between input and supervisory signals, limiting its effectiveness in distinguishing anomalies.

Method: Proposes masked reverse knowledge distillation (MRKD) with two key components: image-level masking (ILM) to capture global information by differentiating signals, and feature-level masking (FLM) to incorporate synthetic feature-level anomalies for local information preservation.

Result: Achieves impressive performance on MVTec dataset: 98.9% image-level AU-ROC, 98.4% pixel-level AU-ROC, and 95.3% AU-PRO. Ablation studies validate MRKD's superiority in mitigating overgeneralization.

Conclusion: MRKD effectively addresses the overgeneralization problem in knowledge distillation for anomaly detection through dual masking strategies, transforming reconstruction into restoration and significantly improving detection performance.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an effective image anomaly detection and localization scheme. However, a major drawback of this scheme is its tendency to overly generalize, primarily due to the similarities between input and supervisory signals. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces a novel technique called masked reverse knowledge distillation (MRKD). By employing image-level masking (ILM) and feature-level masking (FLM), MRKD transforms the task of image reconstruction into image restoration. Specifically, ILM helps to capture global information by differentiating input signals from supervisory signals. On the other hand, FLM incorporates synthetic feature-level anomalies to ensure that the learned representations contain sufficient local information. With these two strategies, MRKD is endowed with stronger image context capture capacity and is less likely to be overgeneralized. Experiments on the widely-used MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that MRKD achieves impressive performance: image-level 98.9% AU-ROC, pixel-level 98.4% AU-ROC, and 95.3% AU-PRO. In addition, extensive ablation experiments have validated the superiority of MRKD in mitigating the overgeneralization problem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision-based system for reading measurements from linear scales (syringe/cylinder) using human-inspired approach with orientation correction and feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While vision models excel at tasks like object detection, few can perform quantitative measurements from images like humans. For lab robot autonomy, reading instrument measurements is crucial but challenging.

Method: Human-inspired approach: 1) Correct orientation of randomly oriented syringe, 2) Reduce area to linear scale region, 3) Extract features (major markers, digits, level indicator), 4) Calculate final reading from extracted features.

Result: System readings compared against human readings showed accurate correspondence, demonstrating reliable measurement extraction from linear scales.

Conclusion: The approach successfully mimics human measurement reading capabilities for linear scales, enabling robots to autonomously read laboratory instruments like syringes and measuring cylinders.

Abstract: Capabilities and the number of vision-based models are increasing rapidly. And these vision models are now able to do more tasks like object detection, image classification, instance segmentation etc. with great accuracy. But models which can take accurate quantitative measurements form an image, as a human can do by just looking at it, are rare. For a robot to work with complete autonomy in a Laboratory environment, it needs to have some basic skills like navigation, handling objects, preparing samples etc. to match human-like capabilities in an unstructured environment. Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale. As a test case we have picked reading level from a syringe and a measuring cylinder. For a randomly oriented syringe we carry out transformations to correct the orientation. To make the system efficient and robust, the area of interest is reduced to just the linear scale containing part of the image. After that, a series of features were extracted like the major makers, the corresponding digits, and the level indicator location, from which the final reading was calculated. Readings obtained using this system were also compared against human read values of the same instances and an accurate correspondence was observed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human conversation involves continuous exchanges of speech and nonverbal cues that convey attention and emotion. Existing frameworks often treat talking and listening as independent processes or rely on non-causal full-sequence modeling, which hinders temporal coherence across conversational turns.

Method: TIMAR (Turn-level Interleaved Masked AutoRegression) is a causal framework that fuses multimodal information within each turn and applies turn-level causal attention to accumulate conversational history. It uses a lightweight diffusion head to predict continuous 3D head dynamics that capture both coordination and expressive variability.

Result: Experiments on the DualTalk benchmark show that TIMAR reduces Fréchet Distance and MSE by 15-30% on the test set, and achieves similar gains on out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: TIMAR provides an effective causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that models bidirectional dialogue dynamics while maintaining temporal coherence across turns, outperforming existing approaches on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Human conversation involves continuous exchanges of speech and nonverbal cues such as head nods, gaze shifts, and facial expressions that convey attention and emotion. Modeling these bidirectional dynamics in 3D is essential for building expressive avatars and interactive robots.

We present TIMAR (Turn-level Interleaved Masked AutoRegression), a causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that models dialogue as interleaved audio-visual contexts. It fuses multimodal information within each turn and applies turn-level causal attention to accumulate conversational history, while a lightweight diffusion head predicts continuous 3D head dynamics that captures both coordination and expressive variability.

TL;DR: Pro-GRPO improves Group Relative Policy Optimization by dynamically pruning low-variance trajectories during sampling, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance through an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO's effectiveness is limited by the conflict between needing large group sizes for good performance and prohibitive computational costs. The authors identify that many trajectories cluster around the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value, leading to inefficient computation.

Method: Pro-GRPO integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. It uses an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy: first expands initial sampling group size to maximize trajectory diversity, then applies multi-step Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF) to latents to dynamically terminate reward-clustered trajectories early, avoiding unnecessary computation.

Result: Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate Pro-GRPO's generality and effectiveness. The high-variance subset selected by OVF outperforms larger unfiltered groups, and Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Pro-GRPO successfully addresses the computational bottleneck in GRPO by proactively pruning low-variance trajectories during sampling, enabling more efficient alignment of generative models through dynamic trajectory management.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a powerful technique for aligning generative models, but its effectiveness is bottlenecked by the conflict between large group sizes and prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs. Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our Pro-GRPO framework.

Method: Created high-resolution 3D scans of diverse bridge structures with detailed semantic labels. Evaluated three state-of-the-art 3D deep learning architectures and analyzed domain gaps from varying sensors.

Result: All architectures performed robustly on bridge segmentation task, but sensor variations caused domain gaps leading to performance degradation of up to 11.4% mIoU.

Conclusion: The dataset enables automated bridge segmentation for infrastructure monitoring, but sensor-induced domain gaps must be addressed as they can significantly impact model performance.

Abstract: We propose a novel dataset that has been specifically designed for 3D semantic segmentation of bridges and the domain gap analysis caused by varying sensors. This addresses a critical need in the field of infrastructure inspection and maintenance, which is essential for modern society. The dataset comprises high-resolution 3D scans of a diverse range of bridge structures from various countries, with detailed semantic labels provided for each. Our initial objective is to facilitate accurate and automated segmentation of bridge components, thereby advancing the structural health monitoring practice. To evaluate the effectiveness of existing 3D deep learning models on this novel dataset, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of three distinct state-of-the-art architectures. Furthermore, we present data acquired through diverse sensors to quantify the domain gap resulting from sensor variations. Our findings indicate that all architectures demonstrate robust performance on the specified task. However, the domain gap can potentially lead to a decline in the performance of up to 11.4% mIoU.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in signer emotion recognition by using cross-lingual transfer learning from spoken language text to sign language video, demonstrating improved performance through temporal segment selection and hand motion features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two main challenges in signer emotion recognition: 1) theoretical challenge of overlap between grammatical and affective facial expressions, and 2) practical challenge of data scarcity for model training.

Method: Uses cross-lingual approach with eJSL (Japanese Sign Language) dataset and BOBSL (British Sign Language) dataset. Employs textual emotion recognition from spoken language subtitles to mitigate sign language data scarcity, incorporates temporal segment selection, and adds hand motion features.

Result: Shows that: 1) textual emotion recognition from spoken language helps with sign language data scarcity, 2) temporal segment selection significantly impacts performance, and 3) hand motion features enhance emotion recognition in signers. Establishes stronger baseline than spoken language LLMs.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual transfer learning from spoken language text to sign language video effectively addresses data scarcity and improves emotion recognition in signers through careful temporal segment selection and hand motion incorporation.

Abstract: Recognition of signers' emotions suffers from one theoretical challenge and one practical challenge, namely, the overlap between grammatical and affective facial expressions and the scarcity of data for model training. This paper addresses these two challenges in a cross-lingual setting using our eJSL dataset, a new benchmark dataset for emotion recognition in Japanese Sign Language signers, and BOBSL, a large British Sign Language dataset with subtitles. In eJSL, two signers expressed 78 distinct utterances with each of seven different emotional states, resulting in 1,092 video clips. We empirically demonstrate that 1) textual emotion recognition in spoken language mitigates data scarcity in sign language, 2) temporal segment selection has a significant impact, and 3) incorporating hand motion enhances emotion recognition in signers. Finally we establish a stronger baseline than spoken language LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces action anticipation in basketball videos, specifically predicting which team gains possession after a shot attempt, using a new dataset of 100K clips with 2K annotated rebounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While computer vision has advanced sports analytics for tracking and action recognition, anticipating actions before they occur in sports videos has received little attention, particularly for predicting post-shot possession outcomes in basketball.

Method: Created a new self-curated dataset of 100,000 basketball video clips (300+ hours) with 2,000+ manually annotated rebound events. Applied state-of-the-art action anticipation methods as baselines, and explored complementary tasks of rebound classification and spotting.

Result: First application of deep learning to basketball rebound prediction, demonstrating feasibility while highlighting challenges. The dataset supports various video understanding applications in basketball where no comparable datasets exist.

Conclusion: Action anticipation for rebounds enables real-time automated broadcasting and post-game analysis tools. The work provides valuable insights into predictive modeling for dynamic multi-agent sports scenarios and establishes a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Computer vision and video understanding have transformed sports analytics by enabling large-scale, automated analysis of game dynamics from broadcast footage. Despite significant advances in player and ball tracking, pose estimation, action localization, and automatic foul recognition, anticipating actions before they occur in sports videos has received comparatively little attention. This work introduces the task of action anticipation in basketball broadcast videos, focusing on predicting which team will gain possession of the ball following a shot attempt. To benchmark this task, a new self-curated dataset comprising 100,000 basketball video clips, over 300 hours of footage, and more than 2,000 manually annotated rebound events is presented. Comprehensive baseline results are reported using state-of-the-art action anticipation methods, representing the first application of deep learning techniques to basketball rebound prediction. Additionally, two complementary tasks, rebound classification and rebound spotting, are explored, demonstrating that this dataset supports a wide range of video understanding applications in basketball, for which no comparable datasets currently exist. Experimental results highlight both the feasibility and inherent challenges of anticipating rebounds, providing valuable insights into predictive modeling for dynamic multi-agent sports scenarios. By forecasting team possession before rebounds occur, this work enables applications in real-time automated broadcasting and post-game analysis tools to support decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMART is a semantic matching contrastive learning model for partially view-aligned clustering that addresses distributional shifts and leverages both aligned and unaligned data to improve clustering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-view data often has misaligned views, making partially view-aligned clustering (PVC) necessary. Existing PVC methods fail to effectively leverage unaligned data to capture shared semantics and suffer from distributional shifts that impair correspondence learning between cross-view features.

Method: Proposes SMART (Semantic MAtching contRasTive learning model) that alleviates cross-view distributional shifts to facilitate semantic matching contrastive learning. The approach fully exploits semantic relationships in both aligned and unaligned data through contrastive learning techniques.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that SMART consistently outperforms existing approaches on the PVC problem.

Conclusion: SMART effectively addresses the challenges of partially view-aligned clustering by mitigating distributional shifts and enabling better semantic matching, leading to improved clustering performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has been empirically shown to improve learning performance by leveraging the inherent complementary information across multiple views of data. However, in real-world scenarios, collecting strictly aligned views is challenging, and learning from both aligned and unaligned data becomes a more practical solution. Partially View-aligned Clustering aims to learn correspondences between misaligned view samples to better exploit the potential consistency and complementarity across views, including both aligned and unaligned data. However, most existing PVC methods fail to leverage unaligned data to capture the shared semantics among samples from the same cluster. Moreover, the inherent heterogeneity of multi-view data induces distributional shifts in representations, leading to inaccuracies in establishing meaningful correspondences between cross-view latent features and, consequently, impairing learning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic MAtching contRasTive learning model (SMART) for PVC. The main idea of our approach is to alleviate the influence of cross-view distributional shifts, thereby facilitating semantic matching contrastive learning to fully exploit semantic relationships in both aligned and unaligned data. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches on the PVC problem.

### [55] [Preserving Marker Specificity with Lightweight Channel-Independent Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15410)
*Simon Gutwein,Arthur Longuefosse,Jun Seita,Sabine Taschner-Mandl,Roxane Licandro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight channel-independent architectures outperform deep early-fusion CNNs for self-supervised representation learning in multiplex tissue imaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiplex tissue imaging captures many protein markers per cell, but most deep learning models use early channel fusion that assumes shared structure across markers, potentially losing marker-specific information important for rare-cell discrimination.

Method: Proposed Channel-Independent Model (CIM-S) with only 5.5K parameters that preserves marker independence, compared against standard early-fusion CNNs and marker-aware baselines. Used contrastive pretraining and linear evaluation on Hodgkin lymphoma CODEX dataset with 145,000 cells and 49 markers.

Result: Channel-independent architectures, especially CIM-S, achieved substantially stronger representations despite compact size. They better retained marker-specific information and improved rare-cell discrimination compared to early-fusion models. Results were consistent across multiple self-supervised frameworks, augmentation settings, and both 49-marker and reduced 18-marker datasets.

Conclusion: Lightweight, channel-independent architectures can match or surpass deep early-fusion CNNs and foundation models for multiplex representation learning, showing that preserving marker independence with deliberately shallow architectures provides a better inductive bias than increasing model scale.

Abstract: Multiplexed tissue imaging measures dozens of protein markers per cell, yet most deep learning models still apply early channel fusion, assuming shared structure across markers. We investigate whether preserving marker independence, combined with deliberately shallow architectures, provides a more suitable inductive bias for self-supervised representation learning in multiplex data than increasing model scale. Using a Hodgkin lymphoma CODEX dataset with 145,000 cells and 49 markers, we compare standard early-fusion CNNs with channel-separated architectures, including a marker-aware baseline and our novel shallow Channel-Independent Model (CIM-S) with 5.5K parameters. After contrastive pretraining and linear evaluation, early-fusion models show limited ability to retain marker-specific information and struggle particularly with rare-cell discrimination. Channel-independent architectures, and CIM-S in particular, achieve substantially stronger representations despite their compact size. These findings are consistent across multiple self-supervised frameworks, remain stable across augmentation settings, and are reproducible across both the 49-marker and reduced 18-marker settings. These results show that lightweight, channel-independent architectures can match or surpass deep early-fusion CNNs and foundation models for multiplex representation learning.

TL;DR: Monocular depth foundation models hallucinate 3D structures from planar but perceptually ambiguous inputs (3D Mirage). The paper introduces a benchmark, evaluation metrics, and a parameter-efficient mitigation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth foundation models achieve great generalization but have a critical vulnerability: they hallucinate 3D structures from geometrically planar but perceptually ambiguous inputs (street art, illusions). This "3D Mirage" failure represents an unquantified safety risk that needs to be addressed.

Method: 1) 3D-Mirage benchmark with real-world illusions and planar-region annotations. 2) Laplacian-based evaluation framework with two metrics: Deviation Composite Score (DCS) for spurious non-planarity and Confusion Composite Score (CCS) for contextual instability. 3) Grounded Self-Distillation: parameter-efficient strategy that enforces planarity on illusion regions while using frozen teacher to preserve background knowledge.

Result: The paper provides the first end-to-end framework to probe, quantify, and tame the 3D Mirage phenomenon. It introduces essential tools for diagnosing and mitigating this failure, with code and benchmark to be publicly available.

Conclusion: The work urges a necessary shift in monocular depth estimation evaluation from pixel-wise accuracy to structural and contextual robustness. It provides foundational tools to address this safety vulnerability in depth foundation models.

Abstract: Monocular depth foundation models achieve remarkable generalization by learning large-scale semantic priors, but this creates a critical vulnerability: they hallucinate illusory 3D structures from geometrically planar but perceptually ambiguous inputs. We term this failure the 3D Mirage. This paper introduces the first end-to-end framework to probe, quantify, and tame this unquantified safety risk. To probe, we present 3D-Mirage, the first benchmark of real-world illusions (e.g., street art) with precise planar-region annotations and context-restricted crops. To quantify, we propose a Laplacian-based evaluation framework with two metrics: the Deviation Composite Score (DCS) for spurious non-planarity and the Confusion Composite Score (CCS) for contextual instability. To tame this failure, we introduce Grounded Self-Distillation, a parameter-efficient strategy that surgically enforces planarity on illusion ROIs while using a frozen teacher to preserve background knowledge, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Our work provides the essential tools to diagnose and mitigate this phenomenon, urging a necessary shift in MDE evaluation from pixel-wise accuracy to structural and contextual robustness. Our code and benchmark will be publicly available to foster this exciting research direction.

TL;DR: A self-evolving GUI automation pipeline with calibrated reward system produces high-quality training data at low cost, enabling state-of-the-art GUI agents (Step-GUI models) with robust general capabilities, complemented by a privacy-preserving protocol (GUI-MCP) and real-world benchmark (AndroidDaily).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses two key challenges in GUI automation: 1) efficiently acquiring high-quality training data while maintaining annotation reliability, and 2) enabling practical deployment across heterogeneous devices while protecting user privacy.

Method: 1) Self-evolving training pipeline with Calibrated Step Reward System that converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration. 2) Step-GUI family of models (4B/8B parameters). 3) GUI-MCP (Model Context Protocol) with hierarchical architecture combining low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation. 4) AndroidDaily benchmark with real-world mobile usage patterns.

Conclusion: The work advances practical GUI agent development with a comprehensive approach combining efficient training data generation, state-of-the-art models, privacy-preserving deployment protocols, and real-world evaluation benchmarks, demonstrating strong potential for real-world deployment in everyday digital interactions.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models unlock unprecedented opportunities for GUI automation. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to efficiently acquire high-quality training data while maintaining annotation reliability? We introduce a self-evolving training pipeline powered by the Calibrated Step Reward System, which converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100x lower cost. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, a family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities. As GUI agent capabilities improve, practical deployment demands standardized interfaces across heterogeneous devices while protecting user privacy. To this end, we propose GUI-MCP, the first Model Context Protocol for GUI automation with hierarchical architecture that combines low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation to local specialist models, enabling high-privacy execution where sensitive data stays on-device. Finally, to assess whether agents can handle authentic everyday usage, we introduce AndroidDaily, a benchmark grounded in real-world mobile usage patterns with 3146 static actions and 235 end-to-end tasks across high-frequency daily scenarios (8B: static 89.91%, end-to-end 52.50%). Our work advances the development of practical GUI agents and demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in everyday digital interactions.

### [58] [CLIP-FTI: Fine-Grained Face Template Inversion via CLIP-Driven Attribute Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15433)
*Longchen Dai,Zixuan Shen,Zhiheng Zhou,Peipeng Yu,Zhihua Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-FTI: A CLIP-driven framework for face template inversion that uses semantic embeddings of facial features to reconstruct fine-grained facial attributes from leaked face templates, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face template inversion methods produce over-smoothed facial attributes with limited transferability, posing privacy risks when templates are leaked. There's a need for more realistic reconstructions that preserve fine-grained facial features.

Method: Uses CLIP model to extract semantic embeddings of facial features, fuses them with leaked templates via cross-modal feature interaction network, projects into StyleGAN's latent space, and generates face images with fine-grained attributes.

Result: Achieves higher identification accuracy and attribute similarity, recovers sharper component-level attribute semantics, and improves cross-model attack transferability across multiple face recognition backbones and datasets.

Conclusion: CLIP-FTI is the first method to use additional information beyond face templates for inversion, achieving state-of-the-art results in reconstructing photorealistic faces with fine-grained attributes from leaked templates.

Abstract: Face recognition systems store face templates for efficient matching. Once leaked, these templates pose a threat: inverting them can yield photorealistic surrogates that compromise privacy and enable impersonation. Although existing research has achieved relatively realistic face template inversion, the reconstructed facial images exhibit over-smoothed facial-part attributes (eyes, nose, mouth) and limited transferability. To address this problem, we present CLIP-FTI, a CLIP-driven fine-grained attribute conditioning framework for face template inversion. Our core idea is to use the CLIP model to obtain the semantic embeddings of facial features, in order to realize the reconstruction of specific facial feature attributes. Specifically, facial feature attribute embeddings extracted from CLIP are fused with the leaked template via a cross-modal feature interaction network and projected into the intermediate latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN. The StyleGAN generator then synthesizes face images with the same identity as the templates but with more fine-grained facial feature attributes. Experiments across multiple face recognition backbones and datasets show that our reconstructions (i) achieve higher identification accuracy and attribute similarity, (ii) recover sharper component-level attribute semantics, and (iii) improve cross-model attack transferability compared to prior reconstruction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first method to use additional information besides the face template attack to realize face template inversion and obtains SOTA results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-DETrack: A spatiotemporal-fusion dual-decoder network for automated branch tracking in plants, achieving 93.6% BMA by adaptively combining spatial and temporal cues with biological constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated extraction of individual plant branches from time-series imagery is computationally challenging due to non-rigid growth dynamics and severe identity fragmentation within entangled canopies, requiring solutions for stage-dependent ambiguities.

Method: ST-DETrack integrates a spatial decoder (using geometric priors like position and angle for early-stage tracking) with a temporal decoder (exploiting motion consistency for late-stage occlusions), plus an adaptive gating mechanism and biological constraint based on negative gravitropism.

Result: Achieves 93.6% Branch Matching Accuracy (BMA) on Brassica napus dataset, outperforming spatial baselines by 28.9 percentage points and temporal baselines by 3.3 percentage points.

Conclusion: ST-DETrack demonstrates robust long-term identity consistency for plant branch tracking in complex, dynamic architectures by adaptively fusing spatial and temporal information with biological priors.

Abstract: Automated extraction of individual plant branches from time-series imagery is essential for high-throughput phenotyping, yet it remains computationally challenging due to non-rigid growth dynamics and severe identity fragmentation within entangled canopies. To overcome these stage-dependent ambiguities, we propose ST-DETrack, a spatiotemporal-fusion dual-decoder network designed to preserve branch identity from budding to flowering. Our architecture integrates a spatial decoder, which leverages geometric priors such as position and angle for early-stage tracking, with a temporal decoder that exploits motion consistency to resolve late-stage occlusions. Crucially, an adaptive gating mechanism dynamically shifts reliance between these spatial and temporal cues, while a biological constraint based on negative gravitropism mitigates vertical growth ambiguities. Validated on a Brassica napus dataset, ST-DETrack achieves a Branch Matching Accuracy (BMA) of 93.6%, significantly outperforming spatial and temporal baselines by 28.9 and 3.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate the method's robustness in maintaining long-term identity consistency amidst complex, dynamic plant architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResNet-101 and Inception v3 were evaluated for wildlife object detection, achieving 94%/0.91 mAP and 95%/0.92 mAP respectively, with Inception v3 slightly outperforming due to multi-scale feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildlife object detection is crucial for biodiversity conservation but faces challenges from environmental variability, visual similarities among species, and intra-class diversity. This study aims to evaluate deep learning models' effectiveness under these complex conditions.

Method: Evaluated ResNet-101 and Inception v3 architectures on wildlife image dataset with standardized preprocessing (resizing to max 800px, RGB conversion, PyTorch tensor transformation). Used 70:30 training-validation split. Both models were trained for object detection tasks.

Result: ResNet-101 achieved 94% classification accuracy and 0.91 mAP. Inception v3 performed slightly better with 95% accuracy and 0.92 mAP. Both showed strong performance but struggled with visually similar species, poor lighting, and occlusion scenarios.

Conclusion: Both ResNet-101 and Inception v3 are effective for wildlife object detection, with Inception v3 having a slight edge due to multi-scale feature extraction. They provide reliable foundation for conservation-focused computer vision applications despite challenges with similar species and difficult environmental conditions.

Abstract: Wildlife object detection plays a vital role in biodiversity conservation, ecological monitoring, and habitat protection. However, this task is often challenged by environmental variability, visual similarities among species, and intra-class diversity. This study investigates the effectiveness of two individual deep learning architectures ResNet-101 and Inception v3 for wildlife object detection under such complex conditions. The models were trained and evaluated on a wildlife image dataset using a standardized preprocessing approach, which included resizing images to a maximum dimension of 800 pixels, converting them to RGB format, and transforming them into PyTorch tensors. A ratio of 70:30 training and validation split was used for model development. The ResNet-101 model achieved a classification accuracy of 94% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91, showing strong performance in extracting deep hierarchical features. The Inception v3 model performed slightly better, attaining a classification accuracy of 95% and a mAP of 0.92, attributed to its efficient multi-scale feature extraction through parallel convolutions. Despite the strong results, both models exhibited challenges when detecting species with similar visual characteristics or those captured under poor lighting and occlusion. Nonetheless, the findings confirm that both ResNet-101 and Inception v3 are effective models for wildlife object detection tasks and provide a reliable foundation for conservation-focused computer vision applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view 3D human pose estimation faces generalization challenges due to scarce large-scale multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth captured under constrained conditions. Existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios and require camera calibration.

Method: Builds on previous MPL framework, introduces RUMPL with 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints, making it independent of camera calibration and number of views. Uses View Fusion Transformer with learned fused-ray tokens to aggregate information along rays for multi-view consistency.

Result: Reduces MPJPE by up to 53% compared to triangulation and over 60% compared to transformer-based image-representation baselines. Shows robustness and scalability on in-the-wild multi-view and multi-person datasets.

Conclusion: RUMPL provides a universal 3D pose lifting solution that works across arbitrary multi-view configurations without retraining, addressing key limitations of existing multi-view approaches through its camera-independent ray-based representation.

Abstract: Estimating 3D human poses from 2D images remains challenging due to occlusions and projective ambiguity. Multi-view learning-based approaches mitigate these issues but often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios, as large-scale multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth are scarce and captured under constrained conditions. To overcome this limitation, recent methods rely on 2D pose estimation combined with 2D-to-3D pose lifting trained on synthetic data. Building on our previous MPL framework, we propose RUMPL, a transformer-based 3D pose lifter that introduces a 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints. This formulation makes the model independent of camera calibration and the number of views, enabling universal deployment across arbitrary multi-view configurations without retraining or fine-tuning. A new View Fusion Transformer leverages learned fused-ray tokens to aggregate information along rays, further improving multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RUMPL reduces MPJPE by up to 53% compared to triangulation and over 60% compared to transformer-based image-representation baselines. Results on new benchmarks, including in-the-wild multi-view and multi-person datasets, confirm its robustness and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feed-forward 3DGS models suffer from suboptimal primitive placement due to dense, rigid pixel grids, which limit both quality and efficiency in scene generation.

Method: Introduces an "Off The Grid" distribution using multi-resolution decoder for sub-pixel primitive detection, trained end-to-end with 3D reconstruction backbone via self-supervised learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis for feed-forward models, generates photorealistic scenes in seconds, uses far fewer primitives, reduces artifacts, and improves camera pose estimation.

Conclusion: The adaptive primitive placement approach enables more accurate and efficient 3D scene generation while demonstrating potential for training foundational models without labels through improved pose estimation.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models enable real-time scene generation but are hindered by suboptimal pixel-aligned primitive placement, which relies on a dense, rigid grid and limits both quality and efficiency. We introduce a new feed-forward architecture that detects 3D Gaussian primitives at a sub-pixel level, replacing the pixel grid with an adaptive, "Off The Grid" distribution. Inspired by keypoint detection, our multi-resolution decoder learns to distribute primitives across image patches. This module is trained end-to-end with a 3D reconstruction backbone using self-supervised learning. Our resulting pose-free model generates photorealistic scenes in seconds, achieving state-of-the-art novel view synthesis for feed-forward models. It outperforms competitors while using far fewer primitives, demonstrating a more accurate and efficient allocation that captures fine details and reduces artifacts. Moreover, we observe that by learning to render 3D Gaussians, our 3D reconstruction backbone improves camera pose estimation, suggesting opportunities to train these foundational models without labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated image forgeries are becoming sophisticated enough to evade traditional forensic detectors, and existing methods lack quantitative measures of manipulation severity, limiting their forensic utility.

Method: VAAS integrates global attention-based anomaly estimation using Vision Transformers with patch-level self-consistency scoring from SegFormer embeddings to produce continuous, interpretable anomaly scores.

Result: VAAS achieves competitive F1 and IoU performance on DF2023 and CASIA v2.0 datasets while providing enhanced visual explainability through attention-guided anomaly maps.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges quantitative detection with human-understandable reasoning, supporting transparent and reliable image integrity assessment for forensic applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-driven image generation have introduced new challenges for verifying the authenticity of digital evidence in forensic investigations. Modern generative models can produce visually consistent forgeries that evade traditional detectors based on pixel or compression artefacts. Most existing approaches also lack an explicit measure of anomaly intensity, which limits their ability to quantify the severity of manipulation. This paper introduces Vision-Attention Anomaly Scoring (VAAS), a novel dual-module framework that integrates global attention-based anomaly estimation using Vision Transformers (ViT) with patch-level self-consistency scoring derived from SegFormer embeddings. The hybrid formulation provides a continuous and interpretable anomaly score that reflects both the location and degree of manipulation. Evaluations on the DF2023 and CASIA v2.0 datasets demonstrate that VAAS achieves competitive F1 and IoU performance, while enhancing visual explainability through attention-guided anomaly maps. The framework bridges quantitative detection with human-understandable reasoning, supporting transparent and reliable image integrity assessment. The source code for all experiments and corresponding materials for reproducing the results are available open source.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeX-Portrait: A diffusion-based portrait animation method with disentangled control over head pose and facial expression using explicit pose transformations and implicit expression codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based portrait animation methods lack high-fidelity disentangled control between head pose and facial expression, preventing applications like expression-only or pose-only editing and animation.

Method: 1) Design motion trainers to learn pose and expression encoders for extracting decomposed driving signals; 2) Inject pose transformation through dual-branch conditioning and expression latent through cross attention in diffusion model; 3) Use progressive hybrid classifier-free guidance for identity consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both animation quality and disentangled controllability.

Conclusion: DeX-Portrait successfully achieves expressive portrait animation with disentangled pose and expression control, enabling flexible editing applications.

Abstract: Portrait animation from a single source image and a driving video is a long-standing problem. Recent approaches tend to adopt diffusion-based image/video generation models for realistic and expressive animation. However, none of these diffusion models realizes high-fidelity disentangled control between the head pose and facial expression, hindering applications like expression-only or pose-only editing and animation. To address this, we propose DeX-Portrait, a novel approach capable of generating expressive portrait animation driven by disentangled pose and expression signals. Specifically, we represent the pose as an explicit global transformation and the expression as an implicit latent code. First, we design a powerful motion trainer to learn both pose and expression encoders for extracting precise and decomposed driving signals. Then we propose to inject the pose transformation into the diffusion model through a dual-branch conditioning mechanism, and the expression latent through cross attention. Finally, we design a progressive hybrid classifier-free guidance for more faithful identity consistency. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both animation quality and disentangled controllability.

TL;DR: EmoCaliber is a confidence-aware Multimodal Large Language Model that verbalizes confidence in visual emotion comprehension, addressing the subjectivity of emotion perception by providing alternative interpretations and self-assessed competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VEC approaches treat emotion prediction as deterministic, ignoring the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception where multiple interpretations can be equally plausible to different viewers. This limitation reduces reliability in practical applications.

Method: A three-stage training framework: 1) progressive structured reasoning, 2) teaching the model to verbalize confidence, and 3) calibrating confidence expression, resulting in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC.

Result: EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods on the VECBench benchmark in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation, validating the effectiveness of the confidence-aware approach.

Conclusion: The proposed confidence-aware approach represents a feasible step toward more reliable VEC systems by accounting for emotion perception subjectivity and providing users with estimates of alternative interpretations and model competence.

Abstract: Visual Emotion Comprehension (VEC) aims to infer sentiment polarities or emotion categories from affective cues embedded in images. In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and mark a feasible step toward more reliable VEC systems. Project page: https://github.com/wdqqdw/EmoCaliber.

TL;DR: GeoMELT is a compact encoder-only transformer model for multi-task learning in remote sensing, addressing text generation from images and cross-modal retrieval with fewer parameters than large vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) are expensive to train and use due to their massive parameter counts, making them inaccessible to most institutions. There's a need for more efficient models that can handle multiple remote sensing tasks like image captioning and visual question answering.

Method: Proposes GeoMELT (Multi-task Efficient Learning Transformer), an encoder-only architecture that addresses multi-task learning with fewer parameters. The model tackles text generation from remote sensing images and cross-modal retrieval tasks in a unified framework.

Result: GeoMELT demonstrates efficacy and efficiency in established benchmarks, confirming that compact encoder-only models can effectively handle multiple remote sensing tasks while reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Encoder-only architectures like GeoMELT provide a viable alternative to large LVLMs for multi-task learning in remote sensing, offering effective performance with significantly reduced parameter counts and computational costs.

Abstract: The remote sensing community has recently seen the emergence of methods based on Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) that can address multiple tasks at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. To fully exploit the potential of such models, a significant focus has been given to the collection of large amounts of training data that cover multiple remote sensing-specific tasks, such as image captioning or visual question answering. However, the cost of using and training LVLMs is high, due to the large number of parameters. While multiple parameter-efficient adaptation techniques have been explored, the computational costs of training and inference with these models can remain prohibitive for most institutions. In this work, we explore the use of encoder-only architectures and propose a model that can effectively address multi-task learning while remaining compact in terms of the number of parameters. In particular, our model tackles combinations of tasks that are not typically explored in a unified model: the generation of text from remote sensing images and cross-modal retrieval. The results of our GeoMELT model - named from Multi-task Efficient Learning Transformer - in established benchmarks confirm the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: BLANKET is a novel infant face anonymization method that generates compatible random faces via diffusion inpainting and performs temporally consistent face swapping with expression transfer, outperforming DeepPrivacy2 on de-identification, attribute preservation, downstream task impact, and artifact reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ethical use of video data with human subjects, especially infants, requires robust anonymization methods that protect privacy while preserving essential facial attributes for research purposes.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Generate compatible random face via diffusion model inpainting, 2) Perform temporally consistent face swapping with authentic expression transfer across video frames.

Result: BLANKET successfully alters identity while outperforming DeepPrivacy2 in de-identification, facial attribute preservation, impact on human pose estimation (downstream task), and artifact reduction.

Conclusion: BLANKET provides an effective solution for infant face anonymization that balances privacy protection with preservation of essential facial attributes, with code available as an easy-to-use demo.

Abstract: Ensuring the ethical use of video data involving human subjects, particularly infants, requires robust anonymization methods. We propose BLANKET (Baby-face Landmark-preserving ANonymization with Keypoint dEtection consisTency), a novel approach designed to anonymize infant faces in video recordings while preserving essential facial attributes. Our method comprises two stages. First, a new random face, compatible with the original identity, is generated via inpainting using a diffusion model. Second, the new identity is seamlessly incorporated into each video frame through temporally consistent face swapping with authentic expression transfer. The method is evaluated on a dataset of short video recordings of babies and is compared to the popular anonymization method, DeepPrivacy2. Key metrics assessed include the level of de-identification, preservation of facial attributes, impact on human pose estimation (as an example of a downstream task), and presence of artifacts. Both methods alter the identity, and our method outperforms DeepPrivacy2 in all other respects. The code is available as an easy-to-use anonymization demo at https://github.com/ctu-vras/blanket-infant-face-anonym.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAN-TED introduces a new paradigm for text encoders in diffusion models with TED-6K benchmark and a two-stage training method for superior text embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text encoder development for diffusion models faces two challenges: lack of efficient evaluation framework and difficulty adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis.

Method: Two contributions: 1) TED-6K text-only benchmark with lightweight adapter for efficient encoder evaluation; 2) Two-stage training: fine-tuning on MLLM for visual representation, then layer-wise weighting for nuanced text features.

Result: TED-6K performance strongly correlates with downstream generation effectiveness; GRAN-TED encoder achieves SOTA on TED-6K and leads to performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation.

Conclusion: GRAN-TED provides both an evaluation framework and superior text encoder that improves semantic fidelity in diffusion-based generation tasks.

Abstract: The text encoder is a critical component of text-to-image and text-to-video diffusion models, fundamentally determining the semantic fidelity of the generated content. However, its development has been hindered by two major challenges: the lack of an efficient evaluation framework that reliably predicts downstream generation performance, and the difficulty of effectively adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis. To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose TED-6K, a novel text-only benchmark that enables efficient and robust assessment of an encoder's representational quality without requiring costly end-to-end model training. We demonstrate that performance on TED-6K, standardized via a lightweight, unified adapter, strongly correlates with an encoder's effectiveness in downstream generation tasks. Second, guided by this validated framework, we develop a superior text encoder using a novel two-stage training paradigm. This process involves an initial fine-tuning stage on a Multimodal Large Language Model for better visual representation, followed by a layer-wise weighting method to extract more nuanced and potent text features. Our experiments show that the resulting GRAN-TED encoder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on TED-6K but also leads to demonstrable performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation.

### [69] [On the Effectiveness of Textual Prompting with Lightweight Fine-Tuning for SAM3 Remote Sensing Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15564)
*Roni Blushtein-Livnon,Osher Rafaeli,David Ioffe,Amir Boger,Karen Sandberg Esquenazi,Tal Svoray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM3 framework for remote sensing image segmentation shows hybrid (semantic+geometric) prompting works best, text-only performs worst, and light fine-tuning offers good performance-effort trade-off for regular targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing image segmentation faces challenges due to limited annotated data and domain gap between overhead imagery and natural images used to train foundational models, requiring effective adaptation under limited supervision.

Method: Evaluated SAM3 concept-driven framework for RS imagery across four target types, comparing textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies under lightweight fine-tuning scales with increasing supervision, alongside zero-shot inference.

Result: Combining semantic and geometric cues yields highest performance. Text-only prompting shows lowest performance with marked gaps for irregular targets. Light fine-tuning offers practical trade-off for regular targets. Performance improves from zero-shot to fine-tuning then shows diminishing returns with more supervision.

Conclusion: Modest geometric annotation effort is sufficient for effective adaptation. Persistent gap between Precision and IoU indicates under-segmentation and boundary inaccuracies remain prevalent, especially for irregular and less prevalent targets in RS tasks.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) image segmentation is constrained by the limited availability of annotated data and a gap between overhead imagery and natural images used to train foundational models. This motivates effective adaptation under limited supervision. SAM3 concept-driven framework generates masks from textual prompts without requiring task-specific modifications, which may enable this adaptation. We evaluate SAM3 for RS imagery across four target types, comparing textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies, under lightweight fine-tuning scales with increasing supervision, alongside zero-shot inference. Results show that combining semantic and geometric cues yields the highest performance across targets and metrics. Text-only prompting exhibits the lowest performance, with marked score gaps for irregularly shaped targets, reflecting limited semantic alignment between SAM3 textual representations and their overhead appearances. Nevertheless, textual prompting with light fine-tuning offers a practical performance-effort trade-off for geometrically regular and visually salient targets. Across targets, performance improves between zero-shot inference and fine-tuning, followed by diminishing returns as the supervision scale increases. Namely, a modest geometric annotation effort is sufficient for effective adaptation. A persistent gap between Precision and IoU further indicates that under-segmentation and boundary inaccuracies remain prevalent error patterns in RS tasks, particularly for irregular and less prevalent targets.

TL;DR: MoonSeg3R enables online zero-shot monocular 3D instance segmentation using CUT3R geometric priors from single RGB streams, achieving competitive performance with RGB-D systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D instance segmentation methods fail in online monocular settings because they rely on posed RGB-D sequences, creating a practical limitation for real-world applications.

Method: Three key components: (1) self-supervised query refinement with spatial-semantic distillation to transform 2D VFM masks into 3D queries; (2) 3D query index memory for temporal consistency; (3) state-distribution token from CUT3R as mask identity descriptor for cross-frame fusion.

Result: First method to enable online monocular 3D segmentation, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art RGB-D-based systems on ScanNet200 and SceneNN datasets.

Conclusion: MoonSeg3R successfully overcomes the RGB-D dependency limitation by leveraging CUT3R geometric priors, enabling practical online 3D instance segmentation from single RGB streams.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on online zero-shot monocular 3D instance segmentation, a novel practical setting where existing approaches fail to perform because they rely on posed RGB-D sequences. To overcome this limitation, we leverage CUT3R, a recent Reconstructive Foundation Model (RFM), to provide reliable geometric priors from a single RGB stream. We propose MoonSeg3R, which introduces three key components: (1) a self-supervised query refinement module with spatial-semantic distillation that transforms segmentation masks from 2D visual foundation models (VFMs) into discriminative 3D queries; (2) a 3D query index memory that provides temporal consistency by retrieving contextual queries; and (3) a state-distribution token from CUT3R that acts as a mask identity descriptor to strengthen cross-frame fusion. Experiments on ScanNet200 and SceneNN show that MoonSeg3R is the first method to enable online monocular 3D segmentation and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art RGB-D-based systems. Code and models will be released.

*Shashank Mishra,Karan Patil,Didier Stricker,Jason Rambach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMKD is a radar-camera 3D object detection framework using multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves sensor characteristics while enhancing complementary strengths, achieving state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge distillation methods for radar-camera fusion often transfer modality-specific features directly, which can distort each sensor's unique characteristics and degrade their individual strengths. There's a need for a distillation approach that preserves intrinsic sensor properties while amplifying their complementary benefits.

Method: IMKD uses a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar with structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused intensity-guided distillation to highlight useful geometry/depth information at fusion level, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism for effective feature alignment and calibration.

Result: Extensive experiments on nuScenes benchmark show IMKD achieves 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods.

Conclusion: IMKD successfully demonstrates that multi-level knowledge distillation can preserve sensor characteristics while enhancing complementary strengths, achieving state-of-the-art radar-camera 3D object detection performance without LiDAR at inference time.

Abstract: High-performance Radar-Camera 3D object detection can be achieved by leveraging knowledge distillation without using LiDAR at inference time. However, existing distillation methods typically transfer modality-specific features directly to each sensor, which can distort their unique characteristics and degrade their individual strengths. To address this, we introduce IMKD, a radar-camera fusion framework based on multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves each sensor's intrinsic characteristics while amplifying their complementary strengths. IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that IMKD reaches 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods.

TL;DR: FlexAvatar creates complete 3D head avatars from single images by combining monocular and multi-view training with transformer-based architecture and bias sinks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with incomplete 3D head reconstructions from single images due to limited multi-view data and entanglement issues in monocular training.

Method: Transformer-based 3D portrait animation model with learnable data source tokens (bias sinks) that enables unified training across monocular and multi-view datasets.

Result: Generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations, outperforming existing methods in view extrapolation and achieving strong generalization.

Conclusion: FlexAvatar successfully addresses the completeness problem in single-image 3D avatar creation by leveraging both monocular and multi-view data through a unified transformer architecture.

Abstract: We introduce FlexAvatar, a method for creating high-quality and complete 3D head avatars from a single image. A core challenge lies in the limited availability of multi-view data and the tendency of monocular training to yield incomplete 3D head reconstructions. We identify the root cause of this issue as the entanglement between driving signal and target viewpoint when learning from monocular videos. To address this, we propose a transformer-based 3D portrait animation model with learnable data source tokens, so-called bias sinks, which enables unified training across monocular and multi-view datasets. This design leverages the strengths of both data sources during inference: strong generalization from monocular data and full 3D completeness from multi-view supervision. Furthermore, our training procedure yields a smooth latent avatar space that facilitates identity interpolation and flexible fitting to an arbitrary number of input observations. In extensive evaluations on single-view, few-shot, and monocular avatar creation tasks, we verify the efficacy of FlexAvatar. Many existing methods struggle with view extrapolation while FlexAvatar generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations. Website: https://tobias-kirschstein.github.io/flexavatar/

TL;DR: Qwen-Image-Layered is a diffusion model that decomposes RGB images into multiple RGBA layers for isolated editing, using RGBA-VAE, VLD-MMDiT architecture, and multi-stage training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual generative models struggle with consistency in image editing due to raster images' entangled nature, while professional design tools use layered representations for isolated edits.

Method: Three key components: (1) RGBA-VAE to unify RGB and RGBA latent representations; (2) VLD-MMDiT architecture for variable-length layer decomposition; (3) Multi-stage training to adapt pretrained models. Also built pipeline to extract multilayer images from PSD files for training data.

Result: Method significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes new paradigm for consistent image editing.

Conclusion: Qwen-Image-Layered enables inherent editability through semantic layer decomposition, addressing consistency issues in image editing with professional-grade layered representations.

Abstract: Recent visual generative models often struggle with consistency during image editing due to the entangled nature of raster images, where all visual content is fused into a single canvas. In contrast, professional design tools employ layered representations, allowing isolated edits while preserving consistency. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{Qwen-Image-Layered}, an end-to-end diffusion model that decomposes a single RGB image into multiple semantically disentangled RGBA layers, enabling \textbf{inherent editability}, where each RGBA layer can be independently manipulated without affecting other content. To support variable-length decomposition, we introduce three key components: (1) an RGBA-VAE to unify the latent representations of RGB and RGBA images; (2) a VLD-MMDiT (Variable Layers Decomposition MMDiT) architecture capable of decomposing a variable number of image layers; and (3) a Multi-stage Training strategy to adapt a pretrained image generation model into a multilayer image decomposer. Furthermore, to address the scarcity of high-quality multilayer training images, we build a pipeline to extract and annotate multilayer images from Photoshop documents (PSD). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes a new paradigm for consistent image editing.

*Johannes Hägerlind,Bao-Long Tran,Urs Waldmann,Per-Erik Forssén*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust method for camera pose estimation and calibration that improves SfM pipelines through better correspondence subsampling and view selection, especially effective for cameras with strong radial distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While SfM has improved camera calibration accuracy, challenges remain for multi-camera setups used in animal behavior studies and forensic analysis of surveillance footage. The paper aims to develop more robust methods for these specific applications.

Method: Analyzes SfM pipeline components and introduces two key improvements: (1) optimal subsampling of dense matcher correspondences for better estimation, and (2) improved criteria for incremental view addition. Also demonstrates correspondence subsampling in global SfM initialized with VGGT.

Result: Significant improvement over baseline methods, especially for cameras with strong radial distortion (79.9% accuracy vs. 40.4% for vanilla VGGT). The pipeline generalizes well across diverse camera setups.

Conclusion: The proposed robust SfM pipeline with improved correspondence handling and view selection could become a valuable tool for animal behavior research and forensic analysis of surveillance footage due to its generalization across various camera configurations.

Abstract: Estimating camera intrinsics and extrinsics is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and while advances in structure-from-motion (SfM) have improved accuracy and robustness, open challenges remain. In this paper, we introduce a robust method for pose estimation and calibration. We consider a set of rigid cameras, each observing the scene from a different perspective, which is a typical camera setup in animal behavior studies and forensic analysis of surveillance footage. Specifically, we analyse the individual components in a structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline, and identify design choices that improve accuracy. Our main contributions are: (1) we investigate how to best subsample the predicted correspondences from a dense matcher to leverage them in the estimation process. (2) We investigate selection criteria for how to add the views incrementally. In a rigorous quantitative evaluation, we show the effectiveness of our changes, especially for cameras with strong radial distortion (79.9% ours vs. 40.4 vanilla VGGT). Finally, we demonstrate our correspondence subsampling in a global SfM setting where we initialize the poses using VGGT. The proposed pipeline generalizes across a wide range of camera setups, and could thus become a useful tool for animal behavior and forensic analysis.

*Yuanhang Li,Yiren Song,Junzhe Bai,Xinran Liang,Hu Yang,Libiao Jin,Qi Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IC-Effect is a DiT-based framework for few-shot video VFX editing that preserves spatial/temporal consistency while injecting complex effects like flames and particles, using instruction guidance and efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video VFX editing is challenging because effects must blend seamlessly with unchanged backgrounds, and existing models fail to meet requirements for background preservation and efficient learning from limited data.

Method: Uses instruction-guided DiT framework with source video as contextual conditions, two-stage training (general editing adaptation + Effect-LoRA for effect-specific learning), and spatiotemporal sparse tokenization for efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show IC-Effect delivers high-quality, controllable, and temporally consistent VFX editing, opening new possibilities for video creation.

Conclusion: IC-Effect successfully addresses video VFX editing challenges through contextual DiT learning, efficient training strategy, and sparse tokenization, enabling complex effect synthesis with strict consistency preservation.

Abstract: We propose \textbf{IC-Effect}, an instruction-guided, DiT-based framework for few-shot video VFX editing that synthesizes complex effects (\eg flames, particles and cartoon characters) while strictly preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Video VFX editing is highly challenging because injected effects must blend seamlessly with the background, the background must remain entirely unchanged, and effect patterns must be learned efficiently from limited paired data. However, existing video editing models fail to satisfy these requirements. IC-Effect leverages the source video as clean contextual conditions, exploiting the contextual learning capability of DiT models to achieve precise background preservation and natural effect injection. A two-stage training strategy, consisting of general editing adaptation followed by effect-specific learning via Effect-LoRA, ensures strong instruction following and robust effect modeling. To further improve efficiency, we introduce spatiotemporal sparse tokenization, enabling high fidelity with substantially reduced computation. We also release a paired VFX editing dataset spanning $15$ high-quality visual styles. Extensive experiments show that IC-Effect delivers high-quality, controllable, and temporally consistent VFX editing, opening new possibilities for video creation.

### [76] [VTCBench: Can Vision-Language Models Understand Long Context with Vision-Text Compression?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15649)
*Hongbo Zhao,Meng Wang,Fei Zhu,Wenzhuo Liu,Bolin Ni,Fanhu Zeng,Gaofeng Meng,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-text compression (VTC) benchmarks reveal that most vision-language models perform poorly on long-context understanding tasks despite good OCR decoding, highlighting limitations in handling compressed visual representations of text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational and memory overheads of expanding LLM context windows limit scalability. Vision-text compression (VTC) offers token compression ratios of 3x-20x by converting text to dense 2D visual representations, but its impact on VLMs' long-context capabilities remains under-investigated.

Method: Introduced the first VTC benchmark with three evaluation settings: VTC-Retrieval (information retrieval and aggregation), VTC-Reasoning (inferring latent associations with minimal lexical overlap), and VTC-Memory (comprehensive QA within long-term dialogue memory). Also established VTCBench-Wild to simulate diverse input scenarios.

Result: Despite good OCR decoding ability, most VLMs (both open-source and proprietary) exhibit surprisingly poor long-context understanding with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in context.

Conclusion: This study provides deep understanding of VTC limitations and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs that can better handle compressed visual representations of text while maintaining long-context understanding capabilities.

Abstract: The computational and memory overheads associated with expanding the context window of LLMs severely limit their scalability. A noteworthy solution is vision-text compression (VTC), exemplified by frameworks like DeepSeek-OCR and Glyph, which convert long texts into dense 2D visual representations, thereby achieving token compression ratios of 3x-20x. However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory. Furthermore, we establish the VTCBench-Wild to simulate diverse input scenarios.We comprehensively evaluate leading open-source and proprietary models on our benchmarks. The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the context.This study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs.

*Yu Zheng,Jie Hu,Kailun Yang,Jiaming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP) framework for autonomous driving that handles both reactive forecasting (predicting what will happen next) and proactive forecasting (predicting outcomes of specific actions), with a novel benchmark and world model achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving requires robust 3D scene understanding that persists through temporal disturbances and accounts for potential future actions. Current approaches lack comprehensive handling of both reactive and proactive forecasting in challenging scenarios with noisy inputs.

Method: Proposes OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model with dense voxel-based scene state representation that incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context using linear-complexity attention and recurrent state-space modules. The model maintains scene memory with ego-motion compensation for online inference.

Result: Achieves average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain) on the new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios including erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames.

Conclusion: The OccSTeP framework effectively addresses both reactive and proactive forecasting for autonomous driving, with OccSTeP-WM demonstrating robust performance even with missing or noisy historical sensor inputs, enabling persistent 4D scene understanding.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires a persistent understanding of 3D scenes that is robust to temporal disturbances and accounts for potential future actions. We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: "what would happen given a specific future action". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain). The data and code will be open source at https://github.com/FaterYU/OccSTeP.

*Ian J. Maquignaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AllSky is a new sky-model that learns from physically captured HDR imagery to generate realistic environment maps with full dynamic range, outperforming existing DNN-based methods in photorealism and illumination accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sky-models fail to faithfully recreate natural skies and cannot support both photorealism and the full 22 f-stops required for outdoor illumination. Current DNN-generated environment maps don't re-light scenes with the same tones, shadows, and illumination as physically captured HDR imagery.

Method: AllSky is a flexible all-weather sky-model learned directly from physically captured HDRI. The authors study input modalities, tonemapping, conditioning, and evaluation of sky-models, allowing intuitive user control over sun positioning and cloud formations.

Result: AllSky achieves state-of-the-art sky-model performance, expands current functionality with intuitive user control, and demonstrates that existing DNN sky-models are not interchangeable with physically captured HDRI or parametric sky-models.

Conclusion: The work shows progress in HDR literature has been tangential to sky-modelling, and current limitations prevent scalability and accurate illumination in downstream applications. AllSky represents a significant advancement toward realistic sky rendering with full dynamic range.

Abstract: Accurate environment maps are a key component for rendering photorealistic outdoor scenes with coherent illumination. They enable captivating visual arts, immersive virtual reality, and a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. Recent works have extended sky-models to be more comprehensive and inclusive of cloud formations but, as we demonstrate, existing methods fall short in faithfully recreating natural skies. Though in recent years the visual quality of DNN-generated High Dynamic Range Imagery (HDRI) has greatly improved, the environment maps generated by DNN sky-models do not re-light scenes with the same tones, shadows, and illumination as physically captured HDR imagery. In this work, we demonstrate progress in HDR literature to be tangential to sky-modelling as current works cannot support both photorealism and the 22 f-stops required for the Full Dynamic Range (FDR) of outdoor illumination. We achieve this by proposing AllSky, a flexible all-weather sky-model learned directly from physically captured HDRI which we leverage to study the input modalities, tonemapping, conditioning, and evaluation of sky-models. Per user-controlled positioning of the sun and cloud formations, AllSky expands on current functionality by allowing for intuitive user control over environment maps and achieves state-of-the-art sky-model performance. Through our proposed evaluation, we demonstrate existing DNN sky-models are not interchangeable with physically captured HDRI or parametric sky-models, with current limitations being prohibitive of scalability and accurate illumination in downstream applications

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InpaintDPO: A DPO-based framework for foreground-conditioned inpainting that addresses spatial relationship hallucinations between foreground subjects and generated backgrounds through specialized optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foreground-conditioned inpainting methods suffer from Spatial Relationship Hallucinations (inappropriate scale, positional relationships, and viewpoints) between foreground subjects and generated backgrounds. The subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it difficult to quantify and apply traditional RLHF methods.

Method: Proposes InpaintDPO framework with three key components: 1) MaskDPO to confine preference optimization to background regions while retaining inpainting loss in foreground; 2) Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization with differentiated cropping to enhance boundary coherence; 3) Shared Commonality Preference Optimization to learn spatial commonality across high-quality winning samples.

Result: The framework ensures plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background elements, addresses gradient conflicts in standard DPO, enhances foreground-background boundary coherence, and promotes shared spatial rationality understanding.

Conclusion: InpaintDPO provides an effective DPO-based solution for spatial rationality in foreground-conditioned inpainting, overcoming challenges of spatial relationship hallucinations through specialized optimization techniques that handle foreground-background interactions and boundary coherence.

Abstract: Foreground-conditioned inpainting, which aims at generating a harmonious background for a given foreground subject based on the text prompt, is an important subfield in controllable image generation. A common challenge in current methods, however, is the occurrence of Spatial Relationship Hallucinations between the foreground subject and the generated background, including inappropriate scale, positional relationships, and viewpoints. Critically, the subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it challenging to quantify, hindering the use of traditional reward-based RLHF methods. To address this issue, we propose InpaintDPO, the first Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based framework dedicated to spatial rationality in foreground-conditioned inpainting, ensuring plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background elements. To resolve the gradient conflicts in standard DPO caused by identical foreground in win-lose pairs, we propose MaskDPO, which confines preference optimization exclusively to the background to enhance background spatial relationships, while retaining the inpainting loss in the foreground region for robust foreground preservation. To enhance coherence at the foreground-background boundary, we propose Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization, which samples pairs with differentiated cropping operations and applies global preference optimization to promote contextual awareness and enhance boundary coherence. Finally, based on the observation that winning samples share a commonality in plausible spatial relationships, we propose Shared Commonality Preference Optimization to enhance the model's understanding of spatial commonality across high-quality winning samples, further promoting shared spatial rationality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Soft labels from teacher models can cause local semantic drift when using few image crops, where crops resemble wrong classes. Hard labels provide content-agnostic anchors to correct this drift. Proposed HALD combines soft and hard labels for better alignment.


<details>

Motivation: Soft labels from teacher models are widely used for knowledge transfer but suffer from local semantic drift when only limited crops per image are used. This drift occurs when a crop visually resembles another class, causing its soft embedding to deviate from the original image's ground-truth semantics, creating mismatch between local visual content and global semantic meaning.

Method: Proposed HALD (Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift) - a new training paradigm that leverages hard labels as intermediate corrective signals while retaining the fine-grained advantages of soft labels. Theoretically characterizes drift under few soft-label supervision and shows hybridizing soft and hard labels restores alignment between visual content and semantic supervision.

Result: Achieves 42.7% accuracy on ImageNet-1K with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LPLD by 9.0%. Extensive experiments on dataset distillation and large-scale conventional classification benchmarks show consistent improvements in generalization.

Conclusion: Hard labels provide powerful content-agnostic anchors to calibrate semantic drift in soft-label-dominated training. Findings re-establish the importance of hard labels as complementary tools and call for rethinking their role in current training paradigms.

Abstract: Soft labels generated by teacher models have become a dominant paradigm for knowledge transfer and recent large-scale dataset distillation such as SRe2L, RDED, LPLD, offering richer supervision than conventional hard labels. However, we observe that when only a limited number of crops per image are used, soft labels are prone to local semantic drift: a crop may visually resemble another class, causing its soft embedding to deviate from the ground-truth semantics of the original image. This mismatch between local visual content and global semantic meaning introduces systematic errors and distribution misalignment between training and testing. In this work, we revisit the overlooked role of hard labels and show that, when appropriately integrated, they provide a powerful content-agnostic anchor to calibrate semantic drift. We theoretically characterize the emergence of drift under few soft-label supervision and demonstrate that hybridizing soft and hard labels restores alignment between visual content and semantic supervision. Building on this insight, we propose a new training paradigm, Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift (HALD), which leverages hard labels as intermediate corrective signals while retaining the fine-grained advantages of soft labels. Extensive experiments on dataset distillation and large-scale conventional classification benchmarks validate our approach, showing consistent improvements in generalization. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve 42.7% with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LPLD by 9.0%. Our findings re-establish the importance of hard labels as a complementary tool, and call for a rethinking of their role in soft-label-dominated training.

TL;DR: Training pipeline combining synthetic images with neural style transfer improves deep vision models' robustness to common corruptions, achieving SOTA results on corruption benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep vision models are vulnerable to common corruptions, and existing data augmentation methods need improvement for better corruption robustness.

Method: Combines synthetic image data generation with neural style transfer augmentation, systematically analyzes hyperparameters, and integrates with rule-based augmentations like TrivialAugment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art corruption robustness: 93.54% on CIFAR-10-C, 74.9% on CIFAR-100-C, and 50.86% on TinyImageNet-C.

Conclusion: Stylization and synthetic data complement each other effectively for improving corruption robustness, though they don't work with all rule-based augmentation techniques.

Abstract: This paper proposes a training data augmentation pipeline that combines synthetic image data with neural style transfer in order to address the vulnerability of deep vision models to common corruptions. We show that although applying style transfer on synthetic images degrades their quality with respect to the common FID metric, these images are surprisingly beneficial for model training. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the effects of both augmentations and their key hyperparameters on the performance of image classifiers. Our results demonstrate that stylization and synthetic data complement each other well and can be combined with popular rule-based data augmentation techniques such as TrivialAugment, while not working with others. Our method achieves state-of-the-art corruption robustness on several small-scale image classification benchmarks, reaching 93.54%, 74.9% and 50.86% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C and TinyImageNet-C, respectively

Conclusion: Skyra addresses the limitations of existing AI-generated video detectors by providing both detection and human-interpretable explanations, advancing the field of explainable AI video detection through artifact-based analysis.

Abstract: The misuse of AI-driven video generation technologies has raised serious social concerns, highlighting the urgent need for reliable AI-generated video detectors. However, most existing methods are limited to binary classification and lack the necessary explanations for human interpretation. In this paper, we present Skyra, a specialized multimodal large language model (MLLM) that identifies human-perceivable visual artifacts in AI-generated videos and leverages them as grounded evidence for both detection and explanation. To support this objective, we construct ViF-CoT-4K for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which represents the first large-scale AI-generated video artifact dataset with fine-grained human annotations. We then develop a two-stage training strategy that systematically enhances our model's spatio-temporal artifact perception, explanation capability, and detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Skyra, we introduce ViF-Bench, a benchmark comprising 3K high-quality samples generated by over ten state-of-the-art video generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyra surpasses existing methods across multiple benchmarks, while our evaluation yields valuable insights for advancing explainable AI-generated video detection.

*Kyle Sargent,Ruiqi Gao,Philipp Henzler,Charles Herrmann,Aleksander Holynski,Li Fei-Fei,Jiajun Wu,Jason Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models can replicate human visual judgments zero-shot, enabling diffusion-based image compression trained directly with VLM preferences instead of traditional perceptual losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional distortion metrics like MSE don't align well with human perception. While prior work uses perceptual losses trained on human judgments, the paper discovers that VLMs can surprisingly replicate human visual preferences zero-shot, motivating their use for human-aligned compression.

Method: Proposes VLIC: a diffusion-based image compression system that uses VLMs to provide binary preference judgments (2AFC) during post-training. Instead of distilling VLM judgments into a separate loss network, the system directly trains with VLM preferences using existing diffusion model preference training techniques.

Result: VLIC achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on human-aligned image compression across different datasets, as measured by perceptual metrics and large-scale user studies. The paper also provides extensive analysis of VLM reward design and training procedures.

Conclusion: VLMs can effectively serve as zero-shot proxies for human visual judgments, enabling high-quality human-aligned image compression without needing large-scale human annotation datasets. The direct preference training approach with VLMs produces state-of-the-art compression performance.

Abstract: Evaluations of image compression performance which include human preferences have generally found that naive distortion functions such as MSE are insufficiently aligned to human perception. In order to align compression models to human perception, prior work has employed differentiable perceptual losses consisting of neural networks calibrated on large-scale datasets of human psycho-visual judgments. We show that, surprisingly, state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) can replicate binary human two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) judgments zero-shot when asked to reason about the differences between pairs of images. Motivated to exploit the powerful zero-shot visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we propose Vision-Language Models for Image Compression (VLIC), a diffusion-based image compression system designed to be post-trained with binary VLM judgments. VLIC leverages existing techniques for diffusion model post-training with preferences, rather than distilling the VLM judgments into a separate perceptual loss network. We show that calibrating this system on VLM judgments produces competitive or state-of-the-art performance on human-aligned visual compression depending on the dataset, according to perceptual metrics and large-scale user studies. We additionally conduct an extensive analysis of the VLM-based reward design and training procedure and share important insights. More visuals are available at https://kylesargent.github.io/vlic

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Resampling Forcing enables end-to-end training of autoregressive video diffusion models without teacher models, using self-resampling to simulate inference errors during training and history routing for efficient long-horizon generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive video diffusion models suffer from exposure bias due to train-test mismatch. Existing solutions require bidirectional teacher models or online discriminators, lacking end-to-end training solutions.

Method: Introduces Resampling Forcing with: 1) Self-resampling scheme that simulates inference-time model errors on history frames during training, 2) Sparse causal mask for temporal causality with parallel training using frame-level diffusion loss, 3) History routing mechanism that dynamically retrieves top-k most relevant history frames for each query.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to distillation-based baselines while exhibiting superior temporal consistency on longer videos due to native-length training.

Conclusion: Resampling Forcing provides a teacher-free, end-to-end framework for training autoregressive video diffusion models from scratch at scale, addressing exposure bias and enabling efficient long-horizon generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models hold promise for world simulation but are vulnerable to exposure bias arising from the train-test mismatch. While recent works address this via post-training, they typically rely on a bidirectional teacher model or online discriminator. To achieve an end-to-end solution, we introduce Resampling Forcing, a teacher-free framework that enables training autoregressive video models from scratch and at scale. Central to our approach is a self-resampling scheme that simulates inference-time model errors on history frames during training. Conditioned on these degraded histories, a sparse causal mask enforces temporal causality while enabling parallel training with frame-level diffusion loss. To facilitate efficient long-horizon generation, we further introduce history routing, a parameter-free mechanism that dynamically retrieves the top-k most relevant history frames for each query. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to distillation-based baselines while exhibiting superior temporal consistency on longer videos owing to native-length training.

*Yu Wang,Juhyung Ha,Frangil M. Ramirez,Yuchen Wang,David J. Crandall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GateFusion introduces a hierarchical gated fusion decoder with auxiliary losses for active speaker detection, achieving SOTA results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Late fusion approaches in active speaker detection fail to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions needed for robust performance in unconstrained scenarios.

Method: Combines pretrained unimodal encoders with Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate) for progressive multi-depth fusion, plus Masked Alignment Loss and Over-Positive Penalty auxiliary objectives.

Result: Achieves 77.8% mAP (+9.4%) on Ego4D-ASD, 86.1% mAP (+2.9%) on UniTalk, 96.1% mAP (+0.5%) on WASD, and competitive performance on AVA-ActiveSpeaker.

Conclusion: GateFusion's hierarchical fusion and auxiliary objectives enable superior cross-modal learning and generalization for active speaker detection.

Abstract: Active Speaker Detection (ASD) aims to identify who is currently speaking in each frame of a video. Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on late fusion to combine visual and audio features, but late fusion often fails to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions, which can be critical for robust performance in unconstrained scenarios. In this paper, we introduce GateFusion, a novel architecture that combines strong pretrained unimodal encoders with a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate). HiGate enables progressive, multi-depth fusion by adaptively injecting contextual features from one modality into the other at multiple layers of the Transformer backbone, guided by learnable, bimodally-conditioned gates. To further strengthen multimodal learning, we propose two auxiliary objectives: Masked Alignment Loss (MAL) to align unimodal outputs with multimodal predictions, and Over-Positive Penalty (OPP) to suppress spurious video-only activations. GateFusion establishes new state-of-the-art results on several challenging ASD benchmarks, achieving 77.8% mAP (+9.4%), 86.1% mAP (+2.9%), and 96.1% mAP (+0.5%) on Ego4D-ASD, UniTalk, and WASD benchmarks, respectively, and delivering competitive performance on AVA-ActiveSpeaker. Out-of-domain experiments demonstrate the generalization of our model, while comprehensive ablations show the complementary benefits of each component.

*Leo Segre,Or Hirschorn,Shai Avidan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to convert single-view foundation models into multi-view foundation models that produce consistent features across different views of the same 3D scene without building explicit 3D models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models process single RGB images independently, leading to inconsistent features for the same 3D point across different views. This inconsistency limits their effectiveness in multi-view scenarios where consistent feature representation is crucial.

Method: Augment Transformers-based foundation models (DINO, SAM, CLIP) with intermediate 3D-aware attention layers that match features across different views, operating directly in image space without constructing explicit 3D feature models.

Result: Quantitative experiments show significant improvement in feature matching compared to current foundation models. The method successfully demonstrates applications in surface normal estimation and multi-view segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively transforms single-view foundation models into multi-view foundation models, enabling consistent feature representation across different views while maintaining the flexibility of direct image-space manipulation.

Abstract: Foundation models are vital tools in various Computer Vision applications. They take as input a single RGB image and output a deep feature representation that is useful for various applications. However, in case we have multiple views of the same 3D scene, they operate on each image independently and do not always produce consistent features for the same 3D point. We propose a way to convert a Foundation Model into a Multi-View Foundation Model. Such a model takes as input a set of images and outputs a feature map for each image such that the features of corresponding points are as consistent as possible. This approach bypasses the need to build a consistent 3D model of the features and allows direct manipulation in the image space. Specifically, we show how to augment Transformers-based foundation models (i.e., DINO, SAM, CLIP) with intermediate 3D-aware attention layers that help match features across different views. As leading examples, we show surface normal estimation and multi-view segmentation tasks. Quantitative experiments show that our method improves feature matching considerably compared to current foundation models.

*Lunbin Zeng,Jingfeng Yao,Bencheng Liao,Hongyuan Tao,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffusionVL enables conversion of autoregressive vision-language models to diffusion-based models with improved performance and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show promise for multimodal tasks but current diffusion VLMs lag behind autoregressive models. The paper investigates whether powerful AR models can be converted to diffusion VLMs to leverage their strengths.

Method: Proposes DiffusionVL framework that translates any AR model into diffusion paradigm through simple fine-tuning. Introduces block-decoding design for arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse.

Result: Achieves 34.4% gain on MMMU-Pro (vision) and 37.5% gain on MME (Cog.) benchmarks with less than 5% training data. Achieves 2x inference speedup and competitive performance with LLaVA-style models.

Conclusion: AR-to-diffusion paradigm shift is effective and feasible, enabling high-performance diffusion VLMs with faster inference using existing AR models.

Abstract: In recent multimodal research, the diffusion paradigm has emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm (AR), owing to its unique decoding advantages. However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup. The model and code are released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionVL.

TL;DR: Pixio is an enhanced masked autoencoder that shows autoencoder-based self-supervised learning remains competitive for representation learning, outperforming DINOv3 on various downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that autoencoder-based self-supervised learning (a classical paradigm) remains competitive today for learning representations from pixels, offering a simple, stable, and efficient alternative to latent-space approaches.

Method: Enhanced masked autoencoder (MAE) with more challenging pre-training tasks and capable architectures, trained on 2B web-crawled images using self-curation with minimal human intervention.

Result: Pixio performs competitively across diverse downstream tasks including monocular depth estimation (Depth Anything), feed-forward 3D reconstruction (MapAnything), semantic segmentation, and robot learning, outperforming or matching DINOv3 trained at similar scales.

Conclusion: Pixel-space self-supervised learning via autoencoders serves as a promising alternative and complement to latent-space approaches, remaining competitive with modern methods while being simpler and more stable.

Abstract: At the most basic level, pixels are the source of the visual information through which we perceive the world. Pixels contain information at all levels, ranging from low-level attributes to high-level concepts. Autoencoders represent a classical and long-standing paradigm for learning representations from pixels or other raw inputs. In this work, we demonstrate that autoencoder-based self-supervised learning remains competitive today and can produce strong representations for downstream tasks, while remaining simple, stable, and efficient. Our model, codenamed "Pixio", is an enhanced masked autoencoder (MAE) with more challenging pre-training tasks and more capable architectures. The model is trained on 2B web-crawled images with a self-curation strategy with minimal human curation. Pixio performs competitively across a wide range of downstream tasks in the wild, including monocular depth estimation (e.g., Depth Anything), feed-forward 3D reconstruction (i.e., MapAnything), semantic segmentation, and robot learning, outperforming or matching DINOv3 trained at similar scales. Our results suggest that pixel-space self-supervised learning can serve as a promising alternative and a complement to latent-space approaches.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) traditionally requires significant human expertise or automated trial-and-error to design deep learning models. We present NN-Caption, an LLM-guided neural architecture search pipeline that generates runnable image-captioning models by composing CNN encoders from LEMUR's classification backbones with sequence decoders (LSTM/GRU/Transformer) under a strict Net API. Using DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B as the primary generator, we present the prompt template and examples of generated architectures. We evaluate on MS COCO with BLEU-4. The LLM generated dozens of captioning models, with over half successfully trained and producing meaningful captions. We analyse the outcomes of using different numbers of input model snippets (5 vs. 10) in the prompt, finding a slight drop in success rate when providing more candidate components. We also report training dynamics (caption accuracy vs. epochs) and the highest BLEU-4 attained. Our results highlight the promise of LLM-guided NAS: the LLM not only proposes architectures but also suggests hyperparameters and training practices. We identify the challenges encountered (e.g., code hallucinations or API compliance issues) and detail how prompt rules and iterative code fixes addressed them. This work presents a pipeline that integrates prompt-based code generation with automatic evaluation, and adds dozens of novel captioning models to the open LEMUR dataset to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and downstream AutoML research.

TL;DR: AutoS is an unsupervised multi-domain adaptation method that autonomously selects relevant source knowledge from massive source domains to improve transfer learning to unlabeled target domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiple source domains often contain redundant or unrelated information that can harm transfer performance, especially in massive-source settings. There's a need to identify and select the most transferable knowledge from many source domains to address target tasks effectively.

Method: AutoS uses a density-driven selection strategy to choose source training samples and determine which source models should contribute to target prediction. It also employs a pseudo-label enhancement module based on a pre-trained multimodal model to mitigate target label noise and improve self-supervision.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to other approaches.

Conclusion: AutoS effectively addresses the challenge of selecting relevant knowledge from massive source domains for unsupervised multi-domain adaptation, improving transfer learning performance through autonomous source knowledge selection and pseudo-label enhancement.

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-domain adaptation plays a key role in transfer learning by leveraging acquired rich source information from multiple source domains to solve target task from an unlabeled target domain. However, multiple source domains often contain much redundant or unrelated information which can harm transfer performance, especially when in massive-source domain settings. It is urgent to develop effective strategies for identifying and selecting the most transferable knowledge from massive source domains to address the target task. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain adaptation method named \underline{\textit{Auto}}nomous Source Knowledge \underline{\textit{S}}election (AutoS) to autonomosly select source training samples and models, enabling the prediction of target task using more relevant and transferable source information. The proposed method employs a density-driven selection strategy to choose source samples during training and to determine which source models should contribute to target prediction. Simulteneously, a pseudo-label enhancement module built on a pre-trained multimodal modal is employed to mitigate target label noise and improve self-supervision. Experiments on real-world datasets indicate the superiority of the proposed method.

*Ryan Cartularo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares two multimodal fusion approaches for sepsis prediction, finding that a Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts architecture outperforms a complex End-to-End Deep Fusion model, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 0.915 AUC for 4-hour prediction and reducing missed cases by 48%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sepsis accounts for 20% of global ICU admissions, but conventional prediction models fail to effectively integrate heterogeneous data streams (vitals, text, imaging), remaining either siloed by modality or reliant on brittle early fusion.

Method: The paper compares two approaches: 1) End-to-End Deep Fusion using a Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network (SepsisFusionFormer), and 2) Context-Aware Stacking using a "leaner" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts architecture (SepsisLateFusion) with three orthogonal experts (Historian for static data, Monitor for temporal data, Reader for NLP) dynamically gated via a CatBoost meta-learner.

Result: SepsisFusionFormer suffered from "attention starvation" and overfitting (AUC 0.66) on small antibiotic cohort. SepsisLateFusion achieved SOTA performance: 0.915 AUC for prediction 4 hours prior to clinical onset, reduced missed cases by 48% relative to default operating point. For antibiotic selection, Quad-Modal Ensemble achieved 0.72 AUC.

Conclusion: Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts architecture outperforms complex end-to-end fusion for sepsis prediction, enabling clinically actionable preventative windows. The models are integrated into SepsisSuite, a deployment-ready Python framework for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Sepsis accounts for nearly 20% of global ICU admissions, yet conventional prediction models often fail to effectively integrate heterogeneous data streams, remaining either siloed by modality or reliant on brittle early fusion. In this work, we present a rigorous architectural comparison between End-to-End Deep Fusion and Context-Aware Stacking for sepsis tasks. We initially hypothesized that a novel Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network -- termed SepsisFusionFormer -- would resolve complex cross-modal interactions between vitals, text, and imaging. However, experiments on MIMIC-IV revealed that SepsisFusionFormer suffered from "attention starvation" in the small antibiotic cohort ($N \approx 2,100$), resulting in overfitting (AUC 0.66). This counterintuitive result informed the design of SepsisLateFusion, a "leaner" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. By treating modalities as orthogonal experts -- the "Historian" (Static), the "Monitor" (Temporal), and the "Reader" (NLP) -- and dynamically gating them via a CatBoost meta-learner, we achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance: 0.915 AUC for prediction 4 hours prior to clinical onset. By calibrating the decision threshold for clinical safety, we reduced missed cases by 48% relative to the default operating point, thus opening a true preventative window for timely intervention over reactive alerts. Furthermore, for the novel prescriptive task of multi-class antibiotic selection, we demonstrate that a Quad-Modal Ensemble achieved the highest performance (0.72 AUC). These models are integrated into SepsisSuite, a deployment-ready Python framework for clinical decision support.

TL;DR: Proposes a Latent Class Reinforcement Learning (LCRL) model to capture heterogeneity in how travelers learn and adapt preferences over time, applied to driving simulator data with three distinct behavioral classes identified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Travel decisions involve experience formation where individuals learn preferences over time, with significant heterogeneity across travelers in both underlying preferences and how these evolve. Current models need to better capture both learning dynamics and individual differences.

Method: Develops a Latent Class Reinforcement Learning (LCRL) model that combines latent class analysis with reinforcement learning to capture heterogeneous preference learning. Applied to driving simulator dataset with parameters estimated through Variational Bayes inference.

Result: Identifies three distinct classes of individuals: 1) context-dependent preferences with context-specific exploitative tendencies, 2) persistent exploitative strategy regardless of context, and 3) exploratory strategy combined with context-specific preferences.

Conclusion: The LCRL model successfully captures heterogeneity in how travelers adapt preferences, revealing distinct behavioral patterns that traditional models would miss. This approach provides better understanding of travel decision-making dynamics with learning.

Abstract: Many travel decisions involve a degree of experience formation, where individuals learn their preferences over time. At the same time, there is extensive scope for heterogeneity across individual travellers, both in their underlying preferences and in how these evolve. The present paper puts forward a Latent Class Reinforcement Learning (LCRL) model that allows analysts to capture both of these phenomena. We apply the model to a driving simulator dataset and estimate the parameters through Variational Bayes. We identify three distinct classes of individuals that differ markedly in how they adapt their preferences: the first displays context-dependent preferences with context-specific exploitative tendencies; the second follows a persistent exploitative strategy regardless of context; and the third engages in an exploratory strategy combined with context-specific preferences.

TL;DR: GSE ResNeXt: A deep learning model combining learnable Gabor convolutional layers with ResNeXt backbone and squeeze-excitation attention for underwater acoustic target classification, outperforming baselines with better stability and 28% faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater acoustic target classification is crucial for environmental monitoring and defense, but faces challenges from complex ship/environmental noise, limited datasets, lack of standardized experimentation, and poor generalization/robustness.

Method: Proposes GSE ResNeXt architecture integrating learnable Gabor convolutional layers (as 2D adaptive band-pass filters) with ResNeXt backbone enhanced by squeeze-and-excitation attention mechanisms. Gabor filters extend feature channel representation and combined with channel attention improve training stability and discriminative feature extraction.

Result: GSE ResNeXt consistently outperforms baseline models (Xception, ResNet, MobileNetV2) in classification performance across three tasks of increasing complexity. Gabor convolutions in initial layers reduce training time by 28%. Distance between vessel and sensor significantly affects performance due to temporal differences between training/testing data.

Conclusion: Signal processing strategies (like Gabor filters) improve reliability and generalization in data-limited underwater acoustic classification. Future work should focus on mitigating environmental factors' impact on input signals.

Abstract: Remotely detecting and classifying underwater acoustic targets is critical for environmental monitoring and defence. However, the complex nature of ship-radiated and environmental underwater noise poses significant challenges to accurate signal processing. While recent advancements in machine learning have improved classification accuracy, issues such as limited dataset availability and a lack of standardised experimentation hinder generalisation and robustness. This paper introduces GSE ResNeXt, a deep learning architecture integrating learnable Gabor convolutional layers with a ResNeXt backbone enhanced by squeeze-and-excitation attention mechanisms. The Gabor filters serve as two-dimensional adaptive band-pass filters, extending the feature channel representation. Its combination with channel attention improves training stability and convergence while enhancing the model's ability to extract discriminative features. The model is evaluated on three classification tasks of increasing complexity. In particular, the impact of temporal differences between the training and testing data is explored, revealing that the distance between the vessel and sensor significantly affects performance. Results show that, GSE ResNeXt consistently outperforms baseline models like Xception, ResNet, and MobileNetV2, in terms of classification performance. Regarding stability and convergence, the addition of Gabor convolutions in the initial layers of the model represents a 28% reduction in training time. These results emphasise the importance of signal processing strategies in improving the reliability and generalisation of models under different environmental conditions, especially in data-limited underwater acoustic classification scenarios. Future developments should focus on mitigating the impact of environmental factors on input signals.

TL;DR: BLADE framework uses gradient-based sensitivity analysis to identify which bits in LLM weights, when flipped, can alter semantic meaning of generated image captions while preserving grammar and fluency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior fault analysis methods focus on crashing classifiers or degrading accuracy, overlooking semantic and linguistic dimensions of generative systems. The paper investigates how subtle bit-level perturbations can influence semantic meaning in LLM-generated image captions while preserving grammatical structure.

Method: BLADE (Bit-level Fault Analysis via Differentiable Estimation) uses gradient-based sensitivity estimation to locate semantically critical bits, then refines selection through a caption-level semantic-fluency objective. The framework is differentiable and predicts which bit perturbations will most strongly influence meaning while maintaining syntax and fluency.

Result: The research demonstrates that even imperceptible low-level bit changes can steer high-level semantics of generative vision-language models. Semantic drifts are not random but differentiably estimable using the model's own gradients.

Conclusion: The work reveals how meaning is encoded, distributed, and alterable at the bit level in LLMs, opening pathways for robustness testing, adversarial defense, and explainable AI by exposing how structured bit-level faults can reshape semantic output.

Abstract: Hard-to-detect hardware bit flips, from either malicious circuitry or bugs, have already been shown to make transformers vulnerable in non-generative tasks. This work, for the first time, investigates how low-level, bitwise perturbations (fault injection) to the weights of a large language model (LLM) used for image captioning can influence the semantic meaning of its generated descriptions while preserving grammatical structure. While prior fault analysis methods have shown that flipping a few bits can crash classifiers or degrade accuracy, these approaches overlook the semantic and linguistic dimensions of generative systems. In image captioning models, a single flipped bit might subtly alter how visual features map to words, shifting the entire narrative an AI tells about the world. We hypothesize that such semantic drifts are not random but differentiably estimable. That is, the model's own gradients can predict which bits, if perturbed, will most strongly influence meaning while leaving syntax and fluency intact. We design a differentiable fault analysis framework, BLADE (Bit-level Fault Analysis via Differentiable Estimation), that uses gradient-based sensitivity estimation to locate semantically critical bits and then refines their selection through a caption-level semantic-fluency objective. Our goal is not merely to corrupt captions, but to understand how meaning itself is encoded, distributed, and alterable at the bit level, revealing that even imperceptible low-level changes can steer the high-level semantics of generative vision-language models. It also opens pathways for robustness testing, adversarial defense, and explainable AI, by exposing how structured bit-level faults can reshape a model's semantic output.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models in financial services necessitates rigorous evaluation frameworks to assess their performance, efficiency, and practical applicability. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the GPT-OSS model family alongside contemporary LLMs across ten diverse financial NLP tasks. Through extensive experimentation on 120B and 20B parameter variants of GPT-OSS, we reveal a counterintuitive finding: the smaller GPT-OSS-20B model achieves comparable accuracy (65.1% vs 66.5%) while demonstrating superior computational efficiency with 198.4 Token Efficiency Score and 159.80 tokens per second processing speed [1]. Our evaluation encompasses sentiment analysis, question answering, and entity recognition tasks using real-world financial datasets including Financial PhraseBank, FiQA-SA, and FLARE FINERORD. We introduce novel efficiency metrics that capture the trade-off between model performance and resource utilization, providing critical insights for deployment decisions in production environments. The benchmark reveals that GPT-OSS models consistently outperform larger competitors including Qwen3-235B, challenging the prevailing assumption that model scale directly correlates with task performance [2].

TL;DR: SEED is a spectral entropy-guided framework for multivariate time series forecasting that addresses issues with existing attention/graph methods by dynamically evaluating dependencies, preserving negative correlations, and improving temporal awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention- or graph-based methods for multivariate time series forecasting have three key issues: (1) strong temporal self-dependencies are disrupted by irrelevant variables, (2) softmax normalization ignores/reverses negative correlations, and (3) variables struggle to perceive their temporal positions.

Method: SEED introduces four key components: (1) Dependency Evaluator using spectral entropy to dynamically assess spatial-temporal dependencies and balance Channel Independence vs Channel Dependence strategies, (2) Spectral Entropy-based Fuser to refine dependency weights and separate temporal regularities from intrinsic dynamics, (3) Signed Graph Constructor with signed edge weights to preserve negative correlations, and (4) Context Spatial Extractor using local contextual windows to help variables perceive temporal positions and extract spatial features.

Result: Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets from various application domains demonstrate that SEED achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and generality.

Conclusion: SEED effectively addresses key limitations in existing multivariate time series forecasting methods by introducing spectral entropy-guided dependency evaluation, signed graph construction, and improved temporal awareness, leading to superior performance across diverse real-world datasets.

Abstract: Effective multivariate time series forecasting often benefits from accurately modeling complex inter-variable dependencies. However, existing attention- or graph-based methods face three key issues: (a) strong temporal self-dependencies are often disrupted by irrelevant variables; (b) softmax normalization ignores and reverses negative correlations; (c) variables struggle to perceive their temporal positions. To address these, we propose \textbf{SEED}, a Spectral Entropy-guided Evaluation framework for spatial-temporal Dependency modeling. SEED introduces a Dependency Evaluator, a key innovation that leverages spectral entropy to dynamically provide a preliminary evaluation of the spatial and temporal dependencies of each variable, enabling the model to adaptively balance Channel Independence (CI) and Channel Dependence (CD) strategies. To account for temporal regularities originating from the influence of other variables rather than intrinsic dynamics, we propose Spectral Entropy-based Fuser to further refine the evaluated dependency weights, effectively separating this part. Moreover, to preserve negative correlations, we introduce a Signed Graph Constructor that enables signed edge weights, overcoming the limitations of softmax. Finally, to help variables perceive their temporal positions and thereby construct more comprehensive spatial features, we introduce the Context Spatial Extractor, which leverages local contextual windows to extract spatial features. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets from various application domains demonstrate that SEED achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and generality.

TL;DR: CAP framework extracts class-aware attribution priors to help SLMs distinguish semantically similar classes, improving interpretability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attribution methods for SLMs highlight class-relevant tokens but often focus on common keywords shared by similar classes, providing insufficient discriminative cues for distinguishing between semantically similar classes that are already hard to differentiate.

Method: Proposes Class-Aware Attribution Prior (CAP) framework that extracts attribution priors capturing fine-grained class distinctions. Also introduces CAP Hybrid that combines CAP priors with existing attribution techniques to create comprehensive supervisory signals, aligning model's self-attribution with these enriched priors.

Result: Extensive experiments in full-data, few-shot, and adversarial scenarios demonstrate consistent improvements in both interpretability and robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The CAP framework successfully addresses limitations of existing attribution methods by providing more discriminative attribution priors that help SLMs learn diverse, decision-relevant features, enhancing both model interpretability and robustness across various scenarios.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are widely used in tasks that require low latency and lightweight deployment, particularly classification. As interpretability and robustness gain increasing importance, explanation-guided learning has emerged as an effective framework by introducing attribution-based supervision during training; however, deriving general and reliable attribution priors remains a significant challenge. Through an analysis of representative attribution methods in classification settings, we find that although these methods can reliably highlight class-relevant tokens, they often focus on common keywords shared by semantically similar classes. Because such classes are already difficult to distinguish under standard training, these attributions provide insufficient discriminative cues, limiting their ability to improve model differentiation. To overcome this limitation, we propose Class-Aware Attribution Prior (CAP), a novel attribution prior extraction framework that guides language models toward capturing fine-grained class distinctions and producing more salient, discriminative attribution priors. Building on this idea, we further introduce CAP Hybrid, which combines priors from CAP with those from existing attribution techniques to form a more comprehensive and balanced supervisory signal. By aligning a model's self-attribution with these enriched priors, our approach encourages the learning of diverse, decision-relevant features. Extensive experiments in full-data, few-shot, and adversarial scenarios demonstrate that our method consistently enhances both interpretability and robustness.

TL;DR: Automated generation of Synthea rules from cancer statistics to create synthetic glioblastoma patient data that preserves statistical properties while enabling privacy-preserving research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic medical data generation enables privacy-compliant secondary use of medical data, but creating meaningful rules for tools like Synthea requires expert knowledge and realistic sample data, making the process complex and resource-intensive.

Method: Developed an approach to automatically generate Synthea rules based on statistics extracted from tabular cancer report data. Created a Synthea module for glioblastoma from real-world datasets and used it to generate synthetic patient data.

Result: The synthetic data reproduced known disease courses and mostly retained the statistical properties of the original dataset. Synthetic glioblastoma data demonstrated realistic patient trajectories while maintaining privacy protection.

Conclusion: Synthetic patient data shows great potential for privacy-preserving medical research, useful for hypothesis formulation and prototype development, though medical interpretation should consider the limitations of current synthetic data approaches.

Abstract: The generation of synthetic data is a promising technology to make medical data available for secondary use in a privacy-compliant manner. A popular method for creating realistic patient data is the rule-based Synthea data generator. Synthea generates data based on rules describing the lifetime of a synthetic patient. These rules typically express the probability of a condition occurring, such as a disease, depending on factors like age. Since they only contain statistical information, rules usually have no specific data protection requirements. However, creating meaningful rules can be a very complex process that requires expert knowledge and realistic sample data. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate an approach to automatically generate Synthea rules based on statistics from tabular data, which we extracted from cancer reports. As an example use case, we created a Synthea module for glioblastoma from a real-world dataset and used it to generate a synthetic dataset. Compared to the original dataset, the synthetic data reproduced known disease courses and mostly retained the statistical properties. Overall, synthetic patient data holds great potential for privacy-preserving research. The data can be used to formulate hypotheses and to develop prototypes, but medical interpretation should consider the specific limitations as with any currently available approach.

In this paper, we improve this approach by applying Hierarchical Attention Transformers (HATs) to solve systems of multivariate polynomial equations via Groebner bases computation. The HAT architecture incorporates a tree-structured inductive bias that enables the modeling of hierarchical relationships present in the data and thus achieves significant computational savings compared to conventional flat attention models. We generalize to arbitrary depths and include a detailed computational cost analysis. Combined with curriculum learning, our method solves instances that are much larger than those in Kera et al.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban wind flow modeling is crucial for air quality assessment and sustainable city planning, but current approaches face challenges: low-order models can't capture complex geometry effects, while high-fidelity CFD simulations are computationally expensive for multiple geometries or wind conditions.

Method: Proposes a generative diffusion framework combining hierarchical graph neural networks with score-based diffusion modeling to generate steady-state urban wind fields over unstructured meshes. The model requires only geometry information, doesn't need temporal rollouts or dense measurements, and is trained across multiple mesh slices and wind angles.

Result: The model generalizes to unseen geometries, recovers key flow structures (wakes and recirculation zones), offers uncertainty-aware predictions, shows robustness to mesh variation, and performs well under different inference regimes. It's the first step toward foundation models for the built environment.

Conclusion: This generative diffusion framework enables rapid evaluation of urban design decisions under densification and climate uncertainty, providing an efficient alternative to expensive CFD simulations while capturing complex geometry effects that low-order models miss.

Abstract: Urban wind flow modeling and simulation play an important role in air quality assessment and sustainable city planning. A key challenge for modeling and simulation is handling the complex geometries of the urban landscape. Low order models are limited in capturing the effects of geometry, while high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are prohibitively expensive, especially across multiple geometries or wind conditions. Here, we propose a generative diffusion framework for synthesizing steady-state urban wind fields over unstructured meshes that requires only geometry information. The framework combines a hierarchical graph neural network with score-based diffusion modeling to generate accurate and diverse velocity fields without requiring temporal rollouts or dense measurements. Trained across multiple mesh slices and wind angles, the model generalizes to unseen geometries, recovers key flow structures such as wakes and recirculation zones, and offers uncertainty-aware predictions. Ablation studies confirm robustness to mesh variation and performance under different inference regimes. This work develops is the first step towards foundation models for the built environment that can help urban planners rapidly evaluate design decisions under densification and climate uncertainty.

TL;DR: A multi-modal semantic communication framework that uses text queries to guide adaptive-resolution transmission of task-relevant image patches based on channel bandwidth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer-based semantic communication approaches struggle with complex scenes containing multiple objects because self-attention lacks explicit task guidance, limiting communication efficiency in bandwidth-constrained environments.

Method: Proposes a multi-modal framework integrating text queries with visual data using cross-modal attention to compute relevance scores. Uses these scores and channel bandwidth to transmit image patches at adaptive resolutions via independently trained encoder-decoder pairs, matching total bitrate to channel capacity.

Result: The system enables efficient semantic communication by preserving task-critical information while adapting to bandwidth constraints, with patches reconstructed at the receiver to maintain essential visual content.

Conclusion: The proposed flexible, goal-driven design addresses limitations of existing approaches by incorporating explicit task guidance through text queries, enabling effective semantic communication in complex, bandwidth-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to transmit information most relevant to a task rather than raw data, offering significant gains in communication efficiency for applications such as telepresence, augmented reality, and remote sensing. Recent transformer-based approaches have used self-attention maps to identify informative regions within images, but they often struggle in complex scenes with multiple objects, where self-attention lacks explicit task guidance. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Semantic Communication framework that integrates text-based user queries to guide the information extraction process. Our proposed system employs a cross-modal attention mechanism that fuses visual features with language embeddings to produce soft relevance scores over the visual data. Based on these scores and the instantaneous channel bandwidth, we use an algorithm to transmit image patches at adaptive resolutions using independently trained encoder-decoder pairs, with total bitrate matching the channel capacity. At the receiver, the patches are reconstructed and combined to preserve task-critical information. This flexible and goal-driven design enables efficient semantic communication in complex and bandwidth-constrained environments.

Motivation: Standard Decision Transformers struggle with long-horizon credit assignment and complex state-action dependencies in offline reinforcement learning, limiting their effectiveness on challenging sequential decision-making tasks.

Method: Quantum Decision Transformer integrates two quantum-inspired components: 1) Quantum-Inspired Attention with entanglement operations for non-local feature correlations, and 2) Quantum Feedforward Networks with multi-path processing and learnable interference for adaptive computation.

Result: Achieves over 2,000% performance improvement compared to standard DTs, with superior generalization across varying data qualities. Ablation studies reveal strong synergy between quantum components - neither alone achieves competitive performance, but their combination produces dramatic improvements.

Conclusion: Quantum-inspired architecture design requires holistic co-design of interdependent mechanisms rather than modular component adoption. The approach provides three key advantages: enhanced credit assignment, implicit ensemble behavior, and adaptive resource allocation, establishing quantum-inspired design as promising for advancing transformer architectures in sequential decision-making.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets without environment interaction, but existing Decision Transformer (DT) architectures struggle with long-horizon credit assignment and complex state-action dependencies. We introduce the Quantum Decision Transformer (QDT), a novel architecture incorporating quantum-inspired computational mechanisms to address these challenges. Our approach integrates two core components: Quantum-Inspired Attention with entanglement operations that capture non-local feature correlations, and Quantum Feedforward Networks with multi-path processing and learnable interference for adaptive computation. Through comprehensive experiments on continuous control tasks, we demonstrate over 2,000\% performance improvement compared to standard DTs, with superior generalization across varying data qualities. Critically, our ablation studies reveal strong synergistic effects between quantum-inspired components: neither alone achieves competitive performance, yet their combination produces dramatic improvements far exceeding individual contributions. This synergy demonstrates that effective quantum-inspired architecture design requires holistic co-design of interdependent mechanisms rather than modular component adoption. Our analysis identifies three key computational advantages: enhanced credit assignment through non-local correlations, implicit ensemble behavior via parallel processing, and adaptive resource allocation through learnable interference. These findings establish quantum-inspired design principles as a promising direction for advancing transformer architectures in sequential decision-making, with implications extending beyond reinforcement learning to neural architecture design more broadly.

Conclusion: The proposed plan-and-execute agentic framework combining LLMs and VLMs effectively automates incidental findings management in abdominal CT scans, offering improved efficiency and precision over existing methods.

Abstract: Incidental findings in CT scans, though often benign, can have significant clinical implications and should be reported following established guidelines. Traditional manual inspection by radiologists is time-consuming and variable. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and foundational vision-language models (VLMs) in a plan-and-execute agentic approach to improve the efficiency and precision of incidental findings detection, classification, and reporting for abdominal CT scans. Given medical guidelines for abdominal organs, the process of managing incidental findings is automated through a planner-executor framework. The planner, based on LLM, generates Python scripts using predefined base functions, while the executor runs these scripts to perform the necessary checks and detections, via VLMs, segmentation models, and image processing subroutines.

*Klaus-Rudolf Kladny,Bernhard Schölkopf,Lisa Koch,Christian F. Baumgartner,Michael Muehlebach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Conformal prediction's statistical guarantees hold for any calibration set size, but practical utility depends heavily on calibration set size, especially problematic in medical domains where data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ML models lack reliable uncertainty estimates needed for safe clinical decisions. While conformal prediction provides statistical guarantees for uncertainty estimates, there's a misconception that these guarantees remain practically meaningful even with small calibration sets, which is particularly relevant in medical domains where data is often scarce.

Method: The paper critiques conformal prediction's promise by analyzing the relationship between calibration set size and practical utility of statistical guarantees. It includes an empirical demonstration on a medical image classification task to support the theoretical critique.

Result: The analysis shows that although conformal prediction's statistical guarantees hold for calibration sets of arbitrary size, the practical utility of these guarantees depends highly on the size of the calibration set. This is particularly problematic in medical domains where obtaining large calibration sets is often infeasible due to data scarcity.

Conclusion: Conformal prediction's theoretical promise of meaningful statistical guarantees with small calibration sets is misleading in practice, especially for medical applications where data scarcity prevents obtaining sufficiently large calibration sets for practically useful uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is transforming healthcare, but safe clinical decisions demand reliable uncertainty estimates that standard ML models fail to provide. Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular tool that allows users to turn heuristic uncertainty estimates into uncertainty estimates with statistical guarantees. CP works by converting predictions of a ML model, together with a calibration sample, into prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the true label with any desired probability. An often cited advantage is that CP theory holds for calibration samples of arbitrary size, suggesting that uncertainty estimates with practically meaningful statistical guarantees can be achieved even if only small calibration sets are available. We question this promise by showing that, although the statistical guarantees hold for calibration sets of arbitrary size, the practical utility of these guarantees does highly depend on the size of the calibration set. This observation is relevant in medical domains because data is often scarce and obtaining large calibration sets is therefore infeasible. We corroborate our critique in an empirical demonstration on a medical image classification task.

Conclusion: The fully data-driven approach eliminates reliance on external/survey data, enhances robustness and applicability, and demonstrates high accuracy using real individual travel trajectory data for validation.

Abstract: Refined trajectory inference of urban rail transit is of great significance to the operation organization. In this paper, we develop a fully data-driven approach to inferring individual travel trajectories in urban rail transit systems. It utilizes data from the Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems to infer key trajectory elements, such as selected train, access/egress time, and transfer time. The approach includes establishing train alternative sets based on spatio-temporal constraints, data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, and trave l trajectory construction. To realize data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, a data-driven parameter estimation method based on KL divergence combined with EM algorithm (KLEM) was proposed. This method eliminates the reliance on external or survey data for parameter fitting, enhancing the robustness and applicability of the model. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of using synthetic data to validate the result, this paper employs real individual travel trajectory data for verification. The results show that the approach developed in this paper can achieve high-precision passenger trajectory inference, with an accuracy rate of over 90% in urban rail transit travel trajectory inference during peak hours.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent hallucinated commitments in high-stakes domains where incorrect semantic interpretations can have serious consequences, especially in regulated environments like finance.

Method: Semantic meaning represented as direction on unit sphere, evidence as witness vectors, admissible interpretations as spherical convex regions. Policy constraints as explicit priors on same manifold. Interpretation reduces to constrained optimization over admissible regions.

Result: Zero hallucinated approvals across multiple policy regimes on large-scale regulated financial data - first such result at scale. Complexity bounds proven information-theoretically optimal.

Conclusion: Geometric framework with separated evidence geometry and policy constraints provides provable prevention of hallucinated commitments, connecting to information theory, Bayesian inference, and sheaf-theoretic semantics.

Abstract: We present a geometric framework for policy-constrained semantic interpretation that provably prevents hallucinated commitments in high-stakes domains. Semantic meaning is represented as direction on a unit sphere, evidence is modeled as sets of witness vectors, and admissible interpretations correspond to spherical convex regions. Policy constraints are introduced as explicit priors defined over the same manifold, separated from evidence geometry. Interpretation reduces to constrained optimization over admissible regions, with refusal emerging as a topologically necessary outcome under contradiction or policy exclusion. We connect this framework to information theory, Bayesian inference, and sheaf-theoretic semantics, proving that our complexity bounds are information-theoretically optimal. Empirical validation on large scale regulated financial data demonstrates zero hallucinated approvals across multiple policy regimes-the first such result at scale.

The ablation study confirms the usefulness of the centroid refinement decoder. The system provides an excellent trade-off between Diarization Error Rate (DER) and computational complexity.

Conclusion: O-EENC-SD offers an efficient, hyperparameter-free online speaker diarization solution that balances performance and computational cost, making it practical for real-time applications while maintaining competitive accuracy with existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce O-EENC-SD: an end-to-end online speaker diarization system based on EEND-EDA, featuring a novel RNN-based stitching mechanism for online prediction. In particular, we develop a novel centroid refinement decoder whose usefulness is assessed through a rigorous ablation study. Our system provides key advantages over existing methods: a hyperparameter-free solution compared to unsupervised clustering approaches, and a more efficient alternative to current online end-to-end methods, which are computationally costly. We demonstrate that O-EENC-SD is competitive with the state of the art in the two-speaker conversational telephone speech domain, as tested on the CallHome dataset. Our results show that O-EENC-SD provides a great trade-off between DER and complexity, even when working on independent chunks with no overlap, making the system extremely efficient.

*Hiroyoshi Nagahama,Katsufumi Inoue,Masayoshi Todorokihara,Michifumi Yoshioka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two phase-aware preprocessing methods for vibration signals improve predictive maintenance accuracy by addressing random phase variations in multi-axis data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most predictive maintenance approaches either discard phase information during spectral feature extraction or use raw waveforms without explicitly leveraging phase, missing valuable information for rotating machinery diagnostics.

Method: Two phase-aware preprocessing strategies: (1) three-axis independent phase adjustment aligning each axis individually to zero phase, and (2) single-axis reference phase adjustment preserving inter-axis relationships with uniform time shifts. Evaluated using a new rotor dataset with synchronized three-axis sensors and six deep learning architectures in a two-stage framework.

Result: Both methods show architecture-independent improvements: three-axis independent method achieves consistent gains (+2.7% for Transformer), while single-axis reference approach delivers superior performance with up to 96.2% accuracy (+5.4%) by preserving spatial phase relationships.

Conclusion: Both phase alignment strategies are practical and scalable enhancements for predictive maintenance systems, with the single-axis reference method being particularly effective due to its preservation of inter-axis phase relationships.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance of rotating machinery increasingly relies on vibration signals, yet most learning-based approaches either discard phase during spectral feature extraction or use raw time-waveforms without explicitly leveraging phase information. This paper introduces two phase-aware preprocessing strategies to address random phase variations in multi-axis vibration data: (1) three-axis independent phase adjustment that aligns each axis individually to zero phase (2) single-axis reference phase adjustment that preserves inter-axis relationships by applying uniform time shifts. Using a newly constructed rotor dataset acquired with a synchronized three-axis sensor, we evaluate six deep learning architectures under a two-stage learning framework. Results demonstrate architecture-independent improvements: the three-axis independent method achieves consistent gains (+2.7\% for Transformer), while the single-axis reference approach delivers superior performance with up to 96.2\% accuracy (+5.4\%) by preserving spatial phase relationships. These findings establish both phase alignment strategies as practical and scalable enhancements for predictive maintenance systems.

*Qiang Chen,Venkatesh Ganapati Hegde,Hongfei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lightweight intra-day personalization for video streaming by injecting recent watch history at inference time without model retraining, achieving 0.47% engagement boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batch-trained models with daily feature updates create stale recommendations that don't incorporate users' most recent actions, limiting personalization effectiveness.

Method: Model-agnostic approach that selectively overrides stale user features at inference time using recent watch history, without requiring model retraining.

Result: Statistically significant 0.47% increase in key user engagement metrics, among the most substantial gains in recent experimentation cycles.

Conclusion: First evidence that intra-day personalization can drive meaningful impact in long-form video streaming, offering a compelling alternative to full real-time architectures requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Many recommender systems in long-form video streaming reply on batch-trained models and batch-updated features, where user features are updated daily and served statically throughout the day. While efficient, this approach fails to incorporate a user's most recent actions, often resulting in stale recommendations. In this work, we present a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for intra-day personalization that selectively injects recent watch history at inference time without requiring model retraining. Our approach selectively overrides stale user features at inference time using the recent watch history, allowing the system to adapt instantly to evolving preferences. By reducing the personalization feedback loop from daily to intra-day, we observed a statistically significant 0.47% increase in key user engagement metrics which ranked among the most substantial engagement gains observed in recent experimentation cycles. To our knowledge, this is the first published evidence that intra-day personalization can drive meaningful impact in long-form video streaming service, providing a compelling alternative to full real-time architectures where model retraining is required.

*Julian Oelhaf,Mehran Pashaei,Georg Kordowich,Christian Bergler,Andreas Maier,Johann Jäger,Siming Bayer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework for evaluating ML model robustness in power system protection under sensor/data degradation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Renewable energy integration challenges conventional protection schemes, requiring ML-based solutions that must be robust against missing, noisy, or degraded sensor data for reliable deployment.

Method: High-fidelity EMT simulations to model realistic degradation scenarios (sensor outages, reduced sampling rates, communication losses), providing consistent benchmarking methodology for ML models.

Result: FC remains stable under most degradation (13% drop under single-phase loss), while FL is more sensitive (150% error increase with voltage loss). Identifies critical measurement channels for resilient operation.

Conclusion: The framework offers actionable guidance for robustness-aware design of future ML-assisted protection systems, enabling more reliable deployment in real-world power systems.

Abstract: The growing penetration of renewable and distributed generation is transforming power systems and challenging conventional protection schemes that rely on fixed settings and local measurements. Machine learning (ML) offers a data-driven alternative for centralized fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL), enabling faster and more adaptive decision-making. However, practical deployment critically depends on robustness. Protection algorithms must remain reliable even when confronted with missing, noisy, or degraded sensor data. This work introduces a unified framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of ML models in power system protection.
  High-fidelity EMT simulations are used to model realistic degradation scenarios, including sensor outages, reduced sampling rates, and transient communication losses. The framework provides a consistent methodology for benchmarking models, quantifying the impact of limited observability, and identifying critical measurement channels required for resilient operation. Results show that FC remains highly stable under most degradation types but drops by about 13% under single-phase loss, while FL is more sensitive overall, with voltage loss increasing localization error by over 150%. These findings offer actionable guidance for robustness-aware design of future ML-assisted protection systems.

TL;DR: Develops a model to estimate and rank conceptual novelty of AI papers using title, abstract, and semantic similarity to prior literature, with two task formulations: binary classification and pairwise novelty comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The surge in AI research publications makes it difficult for truly novel work to stand out, and manual novelty assessment is unstable and time-consuming. Need for data-driven, scalable assessment of research originality.

Method: Uses paper title, abstract, and semantic similarity to prior literature. Explores two task formulations: (1) binary classification predicting absolute novelty, and (2) pairwise novelty comparison learning relative novelty. Fine-tunes Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 and SciBERT, benchmarking against GPT-5.1.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable system for novelty assessment that can help researchers identify innovative submissions and provide reviewers with quantitative novelty signals, addressing the challenge of information overload in AI research.

Abstract: With the growing ease of academic publishing, the volume of research papers, especially in AI-related fields, has surged dramatically. This flood of publications makes it difficult for truly novel and impactful work to stand out, and manual novelty assessment is often unstable and time-consuming. Our project aims to develop a model that estimates and ranks the conceptual novelty of AI papers, enabling a data-driven and scalable assessment of research originality. Such a system can help researchers efficiently identify submissions that introduce genuinely innovative ideas rather than minor variants, and provide conference reviewers with a quantitative and consistent signal of novelty. Our approach evaluates novelty primarily through a paper's title, abstract, and semantic similarity to prior literature. Given the motivation of novelty estimation, we explore two task formulations with different modeling objectives, each offering a different perspective: (1) binary classification, which predicts the paper's absolute novelty from learned patterns of prior novel works, and (2) pairwise novelty comparison, which learns to distinguish papers by relative novelty over others. We fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 and SciBERT on both tasks, benchmarking against GPT-5.1 to analyze how task formulation and modeling choices affect performance. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/ZhengxuYan/NoveltyRank.

*Kornelius Raeth,Nicole Ludwig*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decision calibration evaluates forecasts by their ability to improve decision-making rather than just statistical accuracy, revealing that forecast-level performance doesn't reliably translate to decision-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard forecast evaluations focus on statistical accuracy from the forecaster's perspective, but in practice forecasts are used for decision-making. There's a need to evaluate forecasts from the decision-maker's perspective to quantify their actual value in improving decisions.

Method: Decision calibration framework evaluates forecast performance at the decision level rather than forecast level. Applied to compare Machine Learning and classical numerical weather prediction models across various weather-dependent decision tasks.

Result: Forecast-level performance doesn't reliably translate to decision-level performance. Some performance differences only appear at decision level, and model rankings can change among different decision tasks.

Conclusion: Typical forecast evaluations are insufficient for selecting optimal forecast models for specific decision tasks. Decision calibration provides a more relevant framework for evaluating forecast value in practical applications.

Abstract: Standard weather forecast evaluations focus on the forecaster's perspective and on a statistical assessment comparing forecasts and observations. In practice, however, forecasts are used to make decisions, so it seems natural to take the decision-maker's perspective and quantify the value of a forecast by its ability to improve decision-making. Decision calibration provides a novel framework for evaluating forecast performance at the decision level rather than the forecast level. We evaluate decision calibration to compare Machine Learning and classical numerical weather prediction models on various weather-dependent decision tasks. We find that model performance at the forecast level does not reliably translate to performance in downstream decision-making: some performance differences only become apparent at the decision level, and model rankings can change among different decision tasks. Our results confirm that typical forecast evaluations are insufficient for selecting the optimal forecast model for a specific decision task.

*Aslak Djupskås,Alexander Johannes Stasik,Signe Riemer-Sørensen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCD uncertainty estimates are unreliable compared to Bayesian methods like GPs and BNNs, especially in extrapolation/interpolation regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need reliable uncertainty estimation for safety-critical ML applications, but exact Bayesian inference is computationally infeasible for deep neural networks.

Method: Empirical investigation comparing Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) to Gaussian Processes (GP) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) for uncertainty estimation.

Result: MCD struggles to accurately reflect true uncertainty, particularly failing to capture increased uncertainty in extrapolation and interpolation regions where Bayesian models show proper uncertainty behavior.

Conclusion: Uncertainty estimates from MCD are not as reliable as those from traditional Bayesian approaches (GPs and BNNs) for capturing both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is crucial for machine learning models, especially in safety-critical domains. While exact Bayesian inference offers a principled approach, it is often computationally infeasible for deep neural networks. Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) was proposed as an efficient approximation to Bayesian inference in deep learning by applying neuron dropout at inference time \citep{gal2016dropout}. Hence, the method generates multiple sub-models yielding a distribution of predictions to estimate uncertainty. We empirically investigate its ability to capture true uncertainty and compare to Gaussian Processes (GP) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN). We find that MCD struggles to accurately reflect the underlying true uncertainty, particularly failing to capture increased uncertainty in extrapolation and interpolation regions as observed in Bayesian models. The findings suggest that uncertainty estimates from MCD, as implemented and evaluated in these experiments, is not as reliable as those from traditional Bayesian approaches for capturing epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

### [115] [How Does Fourier Analysis Network Work? A Mechanism Analysis and a New Dual-Activation Layer Proposal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14873)
*Sam Jeong,Hae Yong Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAN's performance gains come from sine activation's non-zero derivative at zero, not its periodicity, addressing vanishing gradients and dying-ReLU problem. This insight led to DAL, a more efficient convergence accelerator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) improves neural network performance, as previous studies showed consistent gains but unclear mechanisms. The goal is to shift from spectral interpretation to concrete training dynamics analysis.

Method: Analyzed FAN components to show only sine activation helps while cosine hurts. Revealed improvement stems from sine's local behavior near x=0 (non-zero derivative) rather than periodicity. Developed Dual-Activation Layer (DAL) as a more efficient convergence accelerator based on this insight.

Result: FAN primarily alleviates dying-ReLU problem by providing stable gradient pathways. DAL models converge faster and achieve equal or higher validation accuracy on three tasks: noisy sinusoidal signal classification, MNIST digit classification, and ECG-based biometric recognition.

Conclusion: FAN's benefits come from addressing vanishing gradients through sine activation's local properties, not spectral characteristics. This understanding enabled development of DAL, a practical convergence accelerator that outperforms conventional activations.

Abstract: Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) was recently proposed as a simple way to improve neural network performance by replacing part of ReLU activations with sine and cosine functions. Although several studies have reported small but consistent gains across tasks, the underlying mechanism behind these improvements has remained unclear. In this work, we show that only the sine activation contributes positively to performance, whereas the cosine activation tends to be detrimental. Our analysis reveals that the improvement is not a consequence of the sine function's periodic nature; instead, it stems from the function's local behavior near x = 0, where its non-zero derivative mitigates the vanishing-gradient problem. We further show that FAN primarily alleviates the dying-ReLU problem, in which a neuron consistently receives negative inputs, produces zero gradients, and stops learning. Although modern ReLU-like activations, such as Leaky ReLU, GELU, and Swish, reduce ReLU's zero-gradient region, they still contain input domains where gradients remain significantly diminished, contributing to slower optimization and hindering rapid convergence. FAN addresses this limitation by introducing a more stable gradient pathway. This analysis shifts the understanding of FAN's benefits from a spectral interpretation to a concrete analysis of training dynamics, leading to the development of the Dual-Activation Layer (DAL), a more efficient convergence accelerator. We evaluate DAL on three tasks: classification of noisy sinusoidal signals versus pure noise, MNIST digit classification, and ECG-based biometric recognition. In all cases, DAL models converge faster and achieve equal or higher validation accuracy compared to models with conventional activations.

### [116] [Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection: An Information-Geometric Unification of Model Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14879)
*Jingwei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ERBP framework explains model collapse in self-referential learning as entropy decay and provides stabilization through entropy reservoirs, unifying various ad-hoc fixes into a single design principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-referential learning suffers from model collapse across domains (language models, GANs, RL), but existing fixes are ad-hoc without unified theoretical understanding. Need a single principle explaining both failure modes and successful fixes.

Method: Propose Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection (ERBP) framework: model closed-loop self-training as stochastic Bregman projection sequence in distribution space. Introduce Entropy Reservoir (high-entropy distribution mixed into each projection) to inject controllable entropy flux that stabilizes dynamics.

Result: Theory yields: (i) necessary condition for collapse, (ii) sufficient condition guaranteeing non-trivial entropy floor, (iii) closed-form rates depending on sample size and Bregman generator constants. Experiments validate predictions across LLM self-training, Soft Actor-Critic RL, and GAN optimization.

Conclusion: ERBP transforms disparate stabilization heuristics into single quantitative design rule: monitor and budget entropy flux. Provides unified framework explaining model collapse and unifying various ad-hoc fixes across different self-referential learning domains.

Abstract: Self-referential learning -- training a model on data it generated itself -- promises boundless scalability but chronically suffers from model collapse: language models degenerate into repetitive text, GANs drop modes, and reinforcement-learning policies over-exploit. Although practitioners employ ad~hoc fixes such as real-data mixing, entropy bonuses, knowledge distillation, or retrieval-augmented generation, a single principle that explains both the failure mode and the success of these fixes has remained elusive. We present Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection (ERBP), an information-geometric framework that unifies these phenomena. We model the closed loop as a stochastic Bregman projection sequence in distribution space. Without external coupling, finite-sample noise forces the system to project onto an ever-shrinking empirical support, causing exponential entropy decay and eventual collapse. Introducing an Entropy Reservoir -- a high-entropy distribution mixed into each projection -- injects a controllable entropy flux that provably stabilises the dynamics. Our theory yields (i) a necessary condition for collapse, (ii) a sufficient condition that guarantees a non-trivial entropy floor, and (iii) closed-form rates that depend only on sample size and the strong-convexity/Lipschitz constants of the Bregman generator. Experiments on large-language-model self-training, Soft Actor-Critic in reinforcement learning, and GAN optimisation validate our predictions and show that disparate stabilisation heuristics correspond to specific reservoir choices and coupling coefficients. ERBP thus transforms a collection of folk remedies into a single, quantitative design rule: monitor and budget your entropy flux.

*Darrin O' Brien,Dhikshith Gajulapalli,Eric Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "task matrices" - linear transformations from base to fine-tuned embedding states - showing they can achieve performance approaching fine-tuned models across vision/text tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While prior work shows linear encodings exist with in-context prompting, it's unclear if similar linear representations exist in more general adaptation regimes like fine-tuning.

Method: Develop task matrices as linear transformations between base and fine-tuned embedding states. Use data-based approximation to efficiently compute these encodings across vision/text models and 10 datasets.

Result: Task matrices surpass linear probe performance, sometimes approaching fine-tuned model levels. Validates existence of cross-layer linear encodings between pretrained and fine-tuned architectures.

Conclusion: Linear task matrices provide efficient, generalizable adaptation method across domains, demonstrating cross-layer linear encodings exist beyond just in-context prompting scenarios.

Abstract: Results in interpretability suggest that large vision and language models learn implicit linear encodings when models are biased by in-context prompting. However, the existence of similar linear representations in more general adaptation regimes has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we develop the concept of a task matrix, a linear transformation from a base to finetuned embedding state. We demonstrate that for vision and text models and ten different datasets, a base model augmented with a task matrix achieves results surpassing linear probes, sometimes approaching finetuned levels. Our results validate the existence of cross-layer linear encodings between pretrained and finetuned architectures. Moreover, we show that a data-based approximation for such encodings is both efficient and generalizable to multiple domains. We make our implementation publicly available.

*Mohammad Abu-Shaira,Alejandro Rodriguez,Greg Speegle,Victor Sheng,Ishfaq Ahmad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OLR-WA is a novel online linear regression model that uses weighted averaging to achieve batch-like performance while handling data drift and confidence-based scenarios effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online learning needs efficient models that avoid large storage and costly recalculations while handling evolving data patterns (drift) and maintaining performance comparable to batch methods.

Method: OLR-WA (Online Regression with Weighted Average) uses a weighted averaging approach that prioritizes older data points with higher confidence levels, adopting a conservative update strategy.

Result: OLR-WA achieves performance comparable to batch regression and outperforms other online models, with rapid convergence (high R² from first iteration), works with minimal initial data (1-10% of total), and uniquely handles confidence-based scenarios.

Conclusion: OLR-WA is a versatile and effective solution for online linear regression tasks, particularly valuable for handling temporal drift and confidence-based scenarios while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Online learning updates models incrementally with new data, avoiding large storage requirements and costly model recalculations. In this paper, we introduce "OLR-WA; OnLine Regression with Weighted Average", a novel and versatile multivariate online linear regression model. We also investigate scenarios involving drift, where the underlying patterns in the data evolve over time, conduct convergence analysis, and compare our approach with existing online regression models. The results of OLR-WA demonstrate its ability to achieve performance comparable to the batch regression, while also showcasing comparable or superior performance when compared with other state-of-the-art online models, thus establishing its effectiveness. Moreover, OLR-WA exhibits exceptional performance in terms of rapid convergence, surpassing other online models with consistently achieving high r2 values as a performance measure from the first iteration to the last iteration, even when initialized with minimal amount of data points, as little as 1% to 10% of the total data points. In addition to its ability to handle time-based (temporal drift) scenarios, remarkably, OLR-WA stands out as the only model capable of effectively managing confidence-based challenging scenarios. It achieves this by adopting a conservative approach in its updates, giving priority to older data points with higher confidence levels. In summary, OLR-WA's performance further solidifies its versatility and utility across different contexts, making it a valuable solution for online linear regression tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OEC (on-policy expert corrections) addresses covariate shift in multi-turn LLM agent training by combining student rollouts with expert interventions, showing 13-14% improvements over imitation learning on software engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning for multi-turn LM agents suffers from covariate shift - as student policies diverge from experts, they encounter unseen states, reducing fine-tuning effectiveness. This is a fundamental limitation of off-policy training.

Method: Proposes OEC (on-policy expert corrections): partially on-policy data generated by starting rollouts with student model, then switching to expert model part way through trajectory. Combines rejection sampling with supervised fine-tuning on SWE tasks.

Result: OEC trajectories show 14% improvement over imitation learning for 7b models and 13% improvement for 32b models on SWE-bench verified. Demonstrates superiority over traditional on-policy and imitation learning approaches.

Conclusion: Combining expert demonstrations with on-policy data is essential for effective multi-turn LM agent training. OEC addresses covariate shift by blending student exploration with expert guidance, inspired by DAgger algorithm principles.

Abstract: A popular paradigm for training LM agents relies on imitation learning, fine-tuning on expert trajectories. However, we show that the off-policy nature of imitation learning for multi-turn LM agents suffers from the fundamental limitation known as covariate shift: as the student policy's behavior diverges from the expert's, it encounters states not present in the training data, reducing the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Taking inspiration from the classic DAgger algorithm, we propose a novel data generation methodology for addressing covariate shift for multi-turn LLM training. We introduce on-policy expert corrections (OECs), partially on-policy data generated by starting rollouts with a student model and then switching to an expert model part way through the trajectory. We explore the effectiveness of our data generation technique in the domain of software engineering (SWE) tasks, a multi-turn setting where LLM agents must interact with a development environment to fix software bugs. Our experiments compare OEC data against various other on-policy and imitation learning approaches on SWE agent problems and train models using a common rejection sampling (i.e., using environment reward) combined with supervised fine-tuning technique. Experiments find that OEC trajectories show a relative 14% and 13% improvement over traditional imitation learning in the 7b and 32b setting, respectively, on SWE-bench verified. Our results demonstrate the need for combining expert demonstrations with on-policy data for effective multi-turn LM agent training.

*Turja Kundu,Sanjukta Bhowmick*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATLAS is a scalable graph learning algorithm that uses multi-level community topology instead of iterative aggregation to handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses two key GNN limitations: 1) accuracy degradation on heterophilic graphs, and 2) scalability issues due to iterative feature aggregation that limits application to large graphs.

Method: Extracts topological information about graph communities at multiple refinement levels, concatenates community assignments to feature vectors, and applies MLPs to the resulting representation without iterative aggregation.

Result: Achieves comparable accuracy to baselines with gains up to 20 percentage points over GCN for heterophilic graphs and 11 percentage points over MLP for homophilic graphs. Shows scalability to large graphs without sampling.

Conclusion: ATLAS provides a scalable, accurate solution for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs while offering explainable graph learning through systematic multi-resolution community features.

Abstract: We present ATLAS (Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs), a novel graph learning algorithm that addresses two important challenges in graph neural networks (GNNs). First, the accuracy of GNNs degrades when the graph is heterophilic. Second, iterative feature aggregation limits the scalability of GNNs to large graphs. We address these challenges by extracting topological information about graph communities at multiple levels of refinement, concatenating community assignments to the feature vector, and applying multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to the resulting representation. This provides topological context about nodes and their neighborhoods without invoking aggregation. Because MLPs are typically more scalable than GNNs, our approach applies to large graphs without the need for sampling. Across a wide set of graphs, ATLAS achieves comparable accuracy to baseline methods, with gains as high as 20 percentage points over GCN for heterophilic graphs with negative structural bias and 11 percentage points over MLP for homophilic graphs. Furthermore, we show how multi-resolution community features systematically modulate performance in both homophilic and heterophilic settings, opening a principled path toward explainable graph learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The regularization parameter is crucial for low-rank MMSE filter performance but challenging to determine efficiently. Existing methods may not work well in low-rank settings where regularization is linked to rank selection.

Method: Proposes an efficient method to find regularization parameter based on Kronecker-product representation of low-rank MMSE filters. The approach connects regularization parameter selection to the rank selection problem.

Result: Simulation results show significant performance gains over commonly used methods, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: Proper regularization parameter selection is essential for low-rank MMSE filters, and the proposed Kronecker-product based method provides an efficient solution with superior performance.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a method to efficiently find the regularization parameter for low-rank MMSE filters based on a Kronecker-product representation. We show that the regularization parameter is surprisingly linked to the problem of rank selection and, thus, properly choosing it, is crucial for low-rank settings. The proposed method is validated through simulations, showing significant gains over commonly used methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for solving MV-FBSDEs with common noise require computationally expensive nested Monte Carlo simulations, creating a need for more efficient numerical approaches.

Method: Combines Picard iterations, elicitability, and deep learning. Uses elicitability to derive path-wise loss functions, trains RNN for mean-field interactions via elicitable scores, and approximates backward process with feedforward networks representing decoupling fields.

Result: Validated on systemic risk inter-bank model with accurate recovery of analytical solutions. Extended to quantile-mediated interactions and applied to non-stationary Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett economic growth model with endogenous interest rates.

Conclusion: The elicitability framework provides an efficient alternative to nested Monte Carlo for MV-FBSDEs with common noise, offering flexibility beyond conditional means and applicability to complex mean-field games without closed-form solutions.

Abstract: We present a novel numerical method for solving McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MV-FBSDEs) with common noise, combining Picard iterations, elicitability and deep learning. The key innovation involves elicitability to derive a path-wise loss function, enabling efficient training of neural networks to approximate both the backward process and the conditional expectations arising from common noise - without requiring computationally expensive nested Monte Carlo simulations. The mean-field interaction term is parameterized via a recurrent neural network trained to minimize an elicitable score, while the backward process is approximated through a feedforward network representing the decoupling field. We validate the algorithm on a systemic risk inter-bank borrowing and lending model, where analytical solutions exist, demonstrating accurate recovery of the true solution. We further extend the model to quantile-mediated interactions, showcasing the flexibility of the elicitability framework beyond conditional means or moments. Finally, we apply the method to a non-stationary Aiyagari--Bewley--Huggett economic growth model with endogenous interest rates, illustrating its applicability to complex mean-field games without closed-form solutions.

Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with constraint compliance in scientific applications. Existing methods (regularization or guidance) bias the model away from true data distribution, especially problematic when constraints are misspecified.

Method: Instead of changing loss or sampling loop, integrate guidance-inspired adjustment into the denoiser itself, giving it a soft inductive bias towards constraint-compliant samples.

Result: Softly constrained denoisers exploit constraint knowledge to improve compliance over standard denoisers while maintaining flexibility to deviate when constraints are misspecified with observed data.

Conclusion: Integrating constraint guidance directly into the denoiser architecture provides a balanced approach that improves constraint compliance without sacrificing model flexibility for handling constraint misspecification.

Abstract: Diffusion models struggle to produce samples that respect constraints, a common requirement in scientific applications. Recent approaches have introduced regularization terms in the loss or guidance methods during sampling to enforce such constraints, but they bias the generative model away from the true data distribution. This is a problem, especially when the constraint is misspecified, a common issue when formulating constraints on scientific data. In this paper, instead of changing the loss or the sampling loop, we integrate a guidance-inspired adjustment into the denoiser itself, giving it a soft inductive bias towards constraint-compliant samples. We show that these softly constrained denoisers exploit constraint knowledge to improve compliance over standard denoisers, and maintain enough flexibility to deviate from it when there is misspecification with observed data.

*Hanqing Jin,Renyuan Xu,Yanzhao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Model-based RL algorithm for controlled diffusion processes with unbounded state spaces using adaptive partitioning and achieves regret bounds scaling with zooming dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world problems in finance, economics, and operations research involve continuous, high-dimensional state spaces with unbounded domains and polynomial reward growth, which existing RL methods struggle to handle efficiently.

Method: Introduces a model-based algorithm that adaptively partitions the joint state-action space, maintaining estimators for drift, volatility, and rewards within each partition, and refines discretization when estimation bias exceeds statistical confidence.

Result: Establishes regret bounds that depend on problem horizon, state dimension, reward growth order, and a newly defined zooming dimension for unbounded diffusion processes, recovering existing bounded results as special cases.

Conclusion: The adaptive partitioning approach enables efficient learning in unbounded continuous domains, validated through numerical experiments including high-dimensional applications like multi-asset portfolio selection.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning for controlled diffusion processes with unbounded continuous state spaces, bounded continuous actions, and polynomially growing rewards: settings that arise naturally in finance, economics, and operations research. To overcome the challenges of continuous and high-dimensional domains, we introduce a model-based algorithm that adaptively partitions the joint state-action space. The algorithm maintains estimators of drift, volatility, and rewards within each partition, refining the discretization whenever estimation bias exceeds statistical confidence. This adaptive scheme balances exploration and approximation, enabling efficient learning in unbounded domains. Our analysis establishes regret bounds that depend on the problem horizon, state dimension, reward growth order, and a newly defined notion of zooming dimension tailored to unbounded diffusion processes. The bounds recover existing results for bounded settings as a special case, while extending theoretical guarantees to a broader class of diffusion-type problems. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments, including applications to high-dimensional problems such as multi-asset mean-variance portfolio selection.

TL;DR: DreamPRM-Code improves coding-focused Process Reward Models by using functions as reasoning steps and meta-learning to correct noisy intermediate labels, achieving state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PRMs for coding are limited because code lacks meaningful step decompositions and suffers from noise in Monte-Carlo-generated partial labels, hindering effective test-time scaling for LLMs in coding tasks.

Method: DreamPRM-Code treats functions as reasoning steps using Chain-of-Function prompting to induce modular code generation, and introduces meta-learning-based correction that leverages clean final-solution unit-test labels with bi-level optimization to refine intermediate labels.

Result: DreamPRM-Code achieved state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench with 80.9 pass@1 rate, surpassing OpenAI o4-mini.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses key limitations of coding PRMs by providing meaningful step decompositions and reducing label noise, enabling superior test-time scaling performance for coding tasks.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have become essential for improving Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling, yet their effectiveness in coding remains limited due to the lack of meaningful step decompositions in code and the noise of Monte-Carlo-generated partial labels. We propose DreamPRM-Code, a coding-focused PRM that treats functions as reasoning steps using a Chain-of-Function prompting strategy to induce modular code generation, enabling PRM training and application analogous to mathematical reasoning tasks. To address label noise, DreamPRM-Code introduces a meta-learning-based correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution unit-test labels and performs bi-level optimization to refine intermediate labels. Applying on test-time scaling, DreamPRM-Code achieved state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench with 80.9 pass@1 rate, surpassing OpenAI o4-mini.

*Sandeep Neela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPA is a deterministic framework that extracts monotonic price runs from daily OHLCV data, aligns them with public events using symmetric correlation windows, and generates factual, historical explanations for transparent market analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing market analysis tools (technical indicators, chart heuristics, predictive models) lack transparency and auditability. Technical indicators are platform-specific, while predictive systems offer little explanation, creating challenges in settings requiring transparency.

Method: SPA uses only daily OHLCV data and normalized event streams. It deterministically extracts monotonic price runs, attaches relevant public events through symmetric correlation windows, and generates guardrailed explanations that are factual and historical.

Result: Evaluation across four equities (AAPL, NVDA, SCHW, PGR) spanning different volatility regimes shows SPA consistently produces stable structural decompositions and contextual narratives. Ablation experiments demonstrate contributions of deterministic segmentation, event alignment, and constrained explanation to interpretability.

Conclusion: SPA is not a forecasting or trading system but provides transparent, reproducible historical price structure analysis. It complements analyst workflows, risk reviews, and explainable-AI pipelines by offering audit-friendly market insights.

Abstract: Understanding how prices evolve over time often requires peeling back the layers of market noise to identify clear, structural behavior. Many of the tools commonly used for this purpose technical indicators, chart heuristics, or even sophisticated predictive models leave important questions unanswered. Technical indicators depend on platform-specific rules, and predictive systems typically offer little in terms of explanation. In settings that demand transparency or auditability, this poses a significant challenge. We introduce the Stock Pattern Assistant (SPA), a deterministic framework designed to extract monotonic price runs, attach relevant public events through a symmetric correlation window, and generate explanations that are factual, historical, and guardrailed. SPA relies only on daily OHLCV data and a normalized event stream, making the pipeline straight-forward to audit and easy to reproduce. To illustrate SPA's behavior in practice, we evaluate it across four equities-AAPL, NVDA, SCHW, and PGR-chosen to span a range of volatility regimes and sector characteristics. Although the evaluation period is modest, the results demonstrate how SPA consistently produces stable structural decompositions and contextual narratives. Ablation experiments further show how deterministic segmentation, event alignment, and constrained explanation each contribute to interpretability. SPA is not a forecasting system, nor is it intended to produce trading signals. Its value lies in offering a transparent, reproducible view of historical price structure that can complement analyst workflows, risk reviews, and broader explainable-AI pipelines.

### [128] [Epistemic diversity across language models mitigates knowledge collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15011)
*Damian Hodel,Jevin D. West*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AI ecosystem diversity can mitigate knowledge collapse, but only up to an optimal level - too little diversity causes rapid decay, while too much reduces individual model capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses concerns about "knowledge collapse" in AI systems - the reduction to dominant ideas - and investigates whether diversity among AI models (ecosystem diversity) can mitigate this problem, inspired by ecological principles.

Method: The researchers build on single-model collapse studies but focus on ecosystems of models trained on their collective output. They segment training data across different language models and evaluate resulting ecosystems over ten self-training iterations to study how diversity affects model performance.

Result: Increased epistemic diversity mitigates collapse, but only up to an optimal level. Too few diverse models fail to express the full distribution, causing rapid performance decay. Too many models reduces each model's approximation capacity, leading to poor performance from the start.

Conclusion: In AI monoculture contexts, there's a need to monitor diversity across AI systems and develop policies that incentivize more domain- and community-specific models to maintain optimal ecosystem diversity and prevent knowledge collapse.

Abstract: The growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) raises concerns of knowledge collapse, i.e., a reduction to the most dominant and central set of ideas. Prior work has demonstrated single-model collapse, defined as performance decay in an AI model trained on its own output. Inspired by ecology, we ask whether AI ecosystem diversity, that is, diversity among models, can mitigate such a collapse. We build on the single-model approach but focus on ecosystems of models trained on their collective output. To study the effect of diversity on model performance, we segment the training data across language models and evaluate the resulting ecosystems over ten, self-training iterations. We find that increased epistemic diversity mitigates collapse, but, interestingly, only up to an optimal level. Our results suggest that an ecosystem containing only a few diverse models fails to express the rich mixture of the full, true distribution, resulting in rapid performance decay. Yet distributing the data across too many models reduces each model's approximation capacity on the true distribution, leading to poor performance already in the first iteration step. In the context of AI monoculture, our results suggest the need to monitor diversity across AI systems and to develop policies that incentivize more domain- and community-specific models.

### [129] [Spectral Representation-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15036)
*Chenxiao Gao,Haotian Sun,Na Li,Dale Schuurmans,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectral representations from transition operator decomposition provide theoretical clarity and practical efficiency for RL, outperforming baselines on 20+ control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL function approximations (like neural networks) have theoretical ambiguities, optimization instability, exploration difficulty, and high computational costs. Spectral representations offer a principled alternative.

Method: Construct spectral representations from transition operator decomposition. Develop learning methods for transition operators with latent variable or energy-based structures, each yielding an effective RL algorithm. Extend to partially observable MDPs.

Result: Algorithms achieve comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines on over 20 challenging DeepMind Control Suite tasks.

Conclusion: Spectral representations provide an effective framework for RL with clear theoretical characterization, addressing key challenges of standard approximations while maintaining strong empirical performance.

Abstract: In real-world applications with large state and action spaces, reinforcement learning (RL) typically employs function approximations to represent core components like the policies, value functions, and dynamics models. Although powerful approximations such as neural networks offer great expressiveness, they often present theoretical ambiguities, suffer from optimization instability and exploration difficulty, and incur substantial computational costs in practice. In this paper, we introduce the perspective of spectral representations as a solution to address these difficulties in RL. Stemming from the spectral decomposition of the transition operator, this framework yields an effective abstraction of the system dynamics for subsequent policy optimization while also providing a clear theoretical characterization. We reveal how to construct spectral representations for transition operators that possess latent variable structures or energy-based structures, which implies different learning methods to extract spectral representations from data. Notably, each of these learning methods realizes an effective RL algorithm under this framework. We also provably extend this spectral view to partially observable MDPs. Finally, we validate these algorithms on over 20 challenging tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, where they achieve performances comparable or superior to current state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines.

*Zijiang Yan,Yixiang Huang,Jianhua Pei,Hina Tabassum,Luca Chiaraviglio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMFusion: A conditional multivariate diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework for frequency-selective EMF levels that integrates contextual factors and provides uncertainty quantification, outperforming baselines by significant margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EMF forecasting uses univariate approaches on aggregate data, but frequency-selective multivariate forecasting is needed to capture inter-operator and inter-frequency variations for proactive network planning, health impact assessment, and compliance monitoring.

Method: EMFusion uses a conditional multivariate diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework with residual U-Net backbone enhanced by cross-attention mechanism to integrate external conditions. It employs imputation-based sampling treating forecasting as structural inpainting for temporal coherence.

Result: EMFusion with working hours contextual information outperforms baseline models: 23.85% improvement in CRPS, 13.93% improvement in normalized RMSE, and 22.47% reduction in prediction CRPS error.

Conclusion: EMFusion provides calibrated probabilistic prediction intervals with explicit uncertainty quantification essential for trustworthy decision-making in EMF monitoring, network planning, and compliance assessment.

Abstract: The rapid growth in wireless infrastructure has increased the need to accurately estimate and forecast electromagnetic field (EMF) levels to ensure ongoing compliance, assess potential health impacts, and support efficient network planning. While existing studies rely on univariate forecasting of wideband aggregate EMF data, frequency-selective multivariate forecasting is needed to capture the inter-operator and inter-frequency variations essential for proactive network planning. To this end, this paper introduces EMFusion, a conditional multivariate diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework that integrates diverse contextual factors (e.g., time of day, season, and holidays) while providing explicit uncertainty estimates. The proposed architecture features a residual U-Net backbone enhanced by a cross-attention mechanism that dynamically integrates external conditions to guide the generation process. Furthermore, EMFusion integrates an imputation-based sampling strategy that treats forecasting as a structural inpainting task, ensuring temporal coherence even with irregular measurements. Unlike standard point forecasters, EMFusion generates calibrated probabilistic prediction intervals directly from the learned conditional distribution, providing explicit uncertainty quantification essential for trustworthy decision-making. Numerical experiments conducted on frequency-selective EMF datasets demonstrate that EMFusion with the contextual information of working hours outperforms the baseline models with or without conditions. The EMFusion outperforms the best baseline by 23.85% in continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), 13.93% in normalized root mean square error, and reduces prediction CRPS error by 22.47%.

### [131] [The Semantic Illusion: Certified Limits of Embedding-Based Hallucination Detection in RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15068)
*Debu Sinha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAG systems still hallucinate despite evidence grounding. Conformal prediction provides coverage guarantees for detection, but embedding-based methods fail on real benchmarks due to "semantic illusion" - plausible hallucinations preserve semantic similarity while introducing factual errors invisible to embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hallucination detection methods for RAG systems rely on semantic similarity and NLI, but their fundamental limitations haven't been rigorously characterized. There's a need for methods with provable guarantees and better understanding of detection capabilities.

Method: Apply conformal prediction to hallucination detection to provide finite-sample coverage guarantees. Test on synthetic hallucinations (Natural Questions) and three real hallucination benchmarks (HaluEval, RAGTruth, WikiBio) across multiple LLMs. Compare embedding-based methods (including OpenAI text-embedding-3-large and cross-encoder models) with GPT-4 as an LLM judge.

Result: On synthetic hallucinations: 94% coverage with 0% false positive rate. On real benchmarks: embedding-based methods show unacceptable FPRs (100% on HaluEval, 88% on RAGTruth, 50% on WikiBio). GPT-4 as LLM judge achieves only 7% FPR, proving the task is solvable through reasoning. This reveals "semantic illusion" - plausible hallucinations preserve similarity to source while introducing factual errors invisible to embeddings.

Conclusion: Embedding-based hallucination detection is insufficient for production RAG deployment due to "semantic illusion." The limitation persists across embedding architectures, LLM generators, and task types. GPT-4's superior performance suggests reasoning-based approaches are needed for effective detection.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain susceptible to hallucinations despite grounding in retrieved evidence. Current detection methods rely on semantic similarity and natural language inference (NLI), but their fundamental limitations have not been rigorously characterized. We apply conformal prediction to hallucination detection, providing finite-sample coverage guarantees that enable precise quantification of detection capabilities. Using calibration sets of approximately 600 examples, we achieve 94% coverage with 0% false positive rate on synthetic hallucinations (Natural Questions). However, on three real hallucination benchmarks spanning multiple LLMs (GPT-4, ChatGPT, GPT-3, Llama-2, Mistral), embedding-based methods - including state-of-the-art OpenAI text-embedding-3-large and cross-encoder models - exhibit unacceptable false positive rates: 100% on HaluEval, 88% on RAGTruth, and 50% on WikiBio. Crucially, GPT-4 as an LLM judge achieves only 7% FPR (95% CI: [3.4%, 13.7%]) on the same data, proving the task is solvable through reasoning. We term this the "semantic illusion": semantically plausible hallucinations preserve similarity to source documents while introducing factual errors invisible to embeddings. This limitation persists across embedding architectures, LLM generators, and task types, suggesting embedding-based detection is insufficient for production RAG deployment.

TL;DR: FEAML is an automated feature engineering method for multi-label classification that uses LLMs' code generation capabilities with metadata and label co-occurrence guidance, incorporating feedback mechanisms for continuous optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based feature engineering methods haven't been applied to multi-label learning tasks, lacking ability to model complex label dependencies and not being adapted to multi-label task characteristics.

Method: Uses LLMs' code generation capabilities guided by metadata and label co-occurrence matrices to understand feature-task relationships and generate high-quality features. Incorporates feedback mechanism where generated features are evaluated by model accuracy and Pearson correlation for redundancy detection, using results to optimize subsequent iterations.

Result: Empirical results on various multi-label datasets demonstrate that FEAML outperforms other feature engineering methods.

Conclusion: FEAML creates an efficient, interpretable, and self-improving feature engineering paradigm by integrating LLMs with feedback mechanisms for multi-label classification tasks.

Abstract: Existing feature engineering methods based on large language models (LLMs) have not yet been applied to multi-label learning tasks. They lack the ability to model complex label dependencies and are not specifically adapted to the characteristics of multi-label tasks. To address the above issues, we propose Feature Engineering Automation for Multi-Label Learning (FEAML), an automated feature engineering method for multi-label classification which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs. By utilizing metadata and label co-occurrence matrices, LLMs are guided to understand the relationships between data features and task objectives, based on which high-quality features are generated. The newly generated features are evaluated in terms of model accuracy to assess their effectiveness, while Pearson correlation coefficients are used to detect redundancy. FEAML further incorporates the evaluation results as feedback to drive LLMs to continuously optimize code generation in subsequent iterations. By integrating LLMs with a feedback mechanism, FEAML realizes an efficient, interpretable and self-improving feature engineering paradigm. Empirical results on various multi-label datasets demonstrate that our FEAML outperforms other feature engineering methods.

TL;DR: NMP is a modular neural physics simulator for elastic materials that combines neural networks with traditional simulation principles, improving interpretability, reliability, and generalization over monolithic neural approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monolithic neural physics simulators lose essential features of traditional numerical simulators like physical interpretability and reliability. The authors want to combine neural network approximation capacity with the physical reliability of modular classical simulators.

Method: Decomposes elastic dynamics into physically meaningful neural modules connected through intermediate physical quantities. Uses specialized architecture and training strategy to transform numerical computation flow into modular neural simulator with direct supervision of intermediate quantities and physical constraints.

Result: NMP demonstrates superior generalization to unseen initial conditions and resolutions, stable long-horizon simulation, better preservation of physical properties compared to other neural simulators, and greater feasibility in scenarios with unknown underlying dynamics than traditional simulators.

Conclusion: NMP successfully combines neural network approximation with traditional simulator reliability through modular design, achieving improved physical consistency and generalizability for elastic simulation.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made significant progress in physics simulation, typically approximating dynamics with a monolithic end-to-end optimized neural network. Although these models offer an effective way to simulation, they may lose essential features compared to traditional numerical simulators, such as physical interpretability and reliability. Drawing inspiration from classical simulators that operate in a modular fashion, this paper presents Neural Modular Physics (NMP) for elastic simulation, which combines the approximation capacity of neural networks with the physical reliability of traditional simulators. Beyond the previous monolithic learning paradigm, NMP enables direct supervision of intermediate quantities and physical constraints by decomposing elastic dynamics into physically meaningful neural modules connected through intermediate physical quantities. With a specialized architecture and training strategy, our method transforms the numerical computation flow into a modular neural simulator, achieving improved physical consistency and generalizability. Experimentally, NMP demonstrates superior generalization to unseen initial conditions and resolutions, stable long-horizon simulation, better preservation of physical properties compared to other neural simulators, and greater feasibility in scenarios with unknown underlying dynamics than traditional simulators.

TL;DR: PIP² Net improves operator learning for PDEs by introducing a partition penalty that stabilizes trunk networks, outperforming existing DeepONet variants on nonlinear PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing operator learning architectures like DeepONet and FNO require large datasets, lack physical structure, and suffer from trunk-network instability (mode imbalance/collapse) that hinders accurate operator approximation.

Method: Developed PIP² Net (Physics-informed Partition Penalty Deep Operator Network) with a simplified, principled partition penalty based on partition-of-unity methods to improve coordinated trunk outputs, enhancing expressiveness while maintaining DeepONet flexibility.

Result: Consistently outperforms DeepONet, PI-DeepONet, and POU-DeepONet in prediction accuracy and robustness on three nonlinear PDEs: viscous Burgers equation, Allen-Cahn equation, and diffusion-reaction system.

Conclusion: PIP² Net successfully addresses trunk-network instability in operator learning through partition-of-unity regularization, achieving better performance and robustness for solving parameterized PDEs.

Abstract: Operator learning has become a powerful tool for accelerating the solution of parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs), enabling rapid prediction of full spatiotemporal fields for new initial conditions or forcing functions. Existing architectures such as DeepONet and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) show strong empirical performance but often require large training datasets, lack explicit physical structure, and may suffer from instability in their trunk-network features, where mode imbalance or collapse can hinder accurate operator approximation. Motivated by the stability and locality of classical partition-of-unity (PoU) methods, we investigate PoU-based regularization techniques for operator learning and develop a revised formulation of the existing POU--PI--DeepONet framework. The resulting \emph{P}hysics-\emph{i}nformed \emph{P}artition \emph{P}enalty Deep Operator Network (PIP$^{2}$ Net) introduces a simplified and more principled partition penalty that improved the coordinated trunk outputs that leads to more expressiveness without sacrificing the flexibility of DeepONet. We evaluate PIP$^{2}$ Net on three nonlinear PDEs: the viscous Burgers equation, the Allen--Cahn equation, and a diffusion--reaction system. The results show that it consistently outperforms DeepONet, PI-DeepONet, and POU-DeepONet in prediction accuracy and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fractional Brownian motion-driven SDEs model systems with rough dynamics and long-range dependence, but their non-Markovian nature and lack of semimartingale structure make classical parameter estimation techniques inapplicable or computationally intractable.

Method: Introduces SigMA (Signature Multi-head Attention), a neural architecture combining path signatures with multi-head self-attention, supported by convolutional preprocessing and multilayer perceptron for feature encoding. Learns parameters from synthetically generated paths of fBm-driven SDEs.

Result: SigMA consistently outperforms CNN, LSTM, vanilla Transformer, and Deep Signature baselines in accuracy, robustness, and model compactness on synthetic data and real-world datasets (equity-index realized volatility and Li-ion battery degradation).

Conclusion: Combining signature transforms with attention-based architectures provides an effective and scalable framework for parameter inference in stochastic systems with rough or persistent temporal structure.

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by fractional Brownian motion (fBm) are increasingly used to model systems with rough dynamics and long-range dependence, such as those arising in quantitative finance and reliability engineering. However, these processes are non-Markovian and lack a semimartingale structure, rendering many classical parameter estimation techniques inapplicable or computationally intractable beyond very specific cases. This work investigates two central questions: (i) whether integrating path signatures into deep learning architectures can improve the trade-off between estimation accuracy and model complexity, and (ii) what constitutes an effective architecture for leveraging signatures as feature maps. We introduce SigMA (Signature Multi-head Attention), a neural architecture that integrates path signatures with multi-head self-attention, supported by a convolutional preprocessing layer and a multilayer perceptron for effective feature encoding. SigMA learns model parameters from synthetically generated paths of fBm-driven SDEs, including fractional Brownian motion, fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and rough Heston models, with a particular focus on estimating the Hurst parameter and on joint multi-parameter inference, and it generalizes robustly to unseen trajectories. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and two real-world datasets (i.e., equity-index realized volatility and Li-ion battery degradation) show that SigMA consistently outperforms CNN, LSTM, vanilla Transformer, and Deep Signature baselines in accuracy, robustness, and model compactness. These results demonstrate that combining signature transforms with attention-based architectures provides an effective and scalable framework for parameter inference in stochastic systems with rough or persistent temporal structure.

TL;DR: FUEL is an unsupervised node representation learning method that adaptively adjusts graph convolution usage to enhance intra-class similarity and inter-class separability, achieving SOTA performance across diverse homophily graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Excessive graph convolution can be suboptimal in non-homophilic graphs, causing similar embeddings for dissimilar nodes. While adjusting graph convolution usage has been explored in supervised settings, it remains underexplored in unsupervised scenarios.

Method: FUEL adaptively learns the adequate degree of graph convolution usage by enhancing intra-class similarity and inter-class separability. Since classes are unknown, it leverages node features to identify node clusters and treats these clusters as proxies for classes.

Result: Extensive experiments with 15 baseline methods and 14 benchmark datasets demonstrate FUEL's effectiveness in downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across graphs with diverse levels of homophily.

Conclusion: FUEL successfully addresses the challenge of adaptive graph convolution usage in unsupervised node representation learning, showing superior performance across various graph types including non-homophilic graphs.

Abstract: Unsupervised node representation learning aims to obtain meaningful node embeddings without relying on node labels. To achieve this, graph convolution, which aggregates information from neighboring nodes, is commonly employed to encode node features and graph topology. However, excessive reliance on graph convolution can be suboptimal-especially in non-homophilic graphs-since it may yield unduly similar embeddings for nodes that differ in their features or topological properties. As a result, adjusting the degree of graph convolution usage has been actively explored in supervised learning settings, whereas such approaches remain underexplored in unsupervised scenarios. To tackle this, we propose FUEL, which adaptively learns the adequate degree of graph convolution usage by aiming to enhance intra-class similarity and inter-class separability in the embedding space. Since classes are unknown, FUEL leverages node features to identify node clusters and treats these clusters as proxies for classes. Through extensive experiments using 15 baseline methods and 14 benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FUEL in downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across graphs with diverse levels of homophily.

### [137] [How Many Heads Make an SSM? A Unified Framework for Attention and State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15115)
*Ali Ghodsi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework for sequence models, revealing fundamental trade-offs between expressivity and gradient propagation in attention vs state-space architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite diverse sequence modeling architectures (RNNs, Transformers, SSMs), there's limited unified theoretical understanding of expressivity and trainability trade-offs. The paper aims to provide a theoretical framework to analyze these trade-offs systematically.

Method: Introduces a unified framework representing sequence maps via input-dependent effective interaction operator W_ij(X). Identifies two construction patterns: (1) Unified Factorized Framework (attention-style mixing) where W_ij varies through scalar coefficients on shared value maps, and (2) Structured Dynamics (state-space recurrences) where W_ij is induced by latent dynamical systems.

Result: Three key theoretical results: 1) Interaction Rank Gap - factorized models like single-head attention have limited operator span; 2) Equivalence Theorem - representing linear SSMs requires k heads for k-dimensional lag operator subspace; 3) Gradient Highway Result - attention has distance-independent gradient paths while stable linear dynamics have distance-dependent gradient attenuation.

Conclusion: The framework formalizes a fundamental trade-off between algebraic expressivity (interaction/operator span) and long-range gradient propagation, providing theoretical grounding for modern sequence architecture design choices between attention and state-space approaches.

Abstract: Sequence modeling has produced diverse architectures -- from classical recurrent neural networks to modern Transformers and state space models (SSMs) -- yet a unified theoretical understanding of expressivity and trainability trade-offs remains limited. We introduce a unified framework that represents a broad class of sequence maps via an input-dependent effective interaction operator $W_{ij}(X)$, making explicit two recurring construction patterns: (i) the Unified Factorized Framework (Explicit) (attention-style mixing), in which $W_{ij}(X)$ varies through scalar coefficients applied to shared value maps, and (ii) Structured Dynamics (Implicit) (state-space recurrences), in which $W_{ij}$ is induced by a latent dynamical system. Using this framework, we derive three theoretical results. First, we establish the Interaction Rank Gap: models in the Unified Factorized Framework, such as single-head attention, are constrained to a low-dimensional operator span and cannot represent certain structured dynamical maps. Second, we prove an Equivalence (Head-Count) Theorem showing that, within our multi-head factorized class, representing a linear SSM whose lag operators span a $k$-dimensional subspace on length-$n$ sequences requires and is achievable with $H=k$ heads. Third, we prove a Gradient Highway Result, showing that attention layers admit inputs with distance-independent gradient paths, whereas stable linear dynamics exhibit distance-dependent gradient attenuation. Together, these results formalize a fundamental trade-off between algebraic expressivity (interaction/operator span) and long-range gradient propagation, providing theoretical grounding for modern sequence architecture design.

TL;DR: FADTI: A frequency-aware diffusion model for multivariate time series imputation that outperforms existing methods, especially under high missing rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer- and diffusion-based models lack explicit inductive biases and frequency awareness, limiting their generalization under structured missing patterns and distribution shifts in multivariate time series imputation.

Method: Proposes FADTI framework with learnable Fourier Bias Projection (FBP) module that injects frequency-informed feature modulation, combined with temporal modeling through self-attention and gated convolution. FBP supports multiple spectral bases for adaptive encoding of both stationary and non-stationary patterns.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmarks, including a new biological time series dataset, show FADTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under high missing rates.

Conclusion: FADTI successfully injects frequency-domain inductive bias into the generative imputation process, demonstrating superior performance for multivariate time series imputation across various domains.

Abstract: Multivariate time series imputation is fundamental in applications such as healthcare, traffic forecasting, and biological modeling, where sensor failures and irregular sampling lead to pervasive missing values. However, existing Transformer- and diffusion-based models lack explicit inductive biases and frequency awareness, limiting their generalization under structured missing patterns and distribution shifts. We propose FADTI, a diffusion-based framework that injects frequency-informed feature modulation via a learnable Fourier Bias Projection (FBP) module and combines it with temporal modeling through self-attention and gated convolution. FBP supports multiple spectral bases, enabling adaptive encoding of both stationary and non-stationary patterns. This design injects frequency-domain inductive bias into the generative imputation process. Experiments on multiple benchmarks, including a newly introduced biological time series dataset, show that FADTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under high missing rates.

*Yuqing Xie,Jiayu Chen,Wenhao Tang,Ya Zhang,Chao Yu,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MORSE is a framework that automatically combines multiple heuristic rewards into a unified reward function through bi-level optimization with exploration mechanisms to avoid local minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing effective reward functions is challenging in RL, especially for multi-objective environments where balancing multiple objectives is difficult.

Method: MORSE uses bi-level optimization: inner loop trains policy to maximize current shaped reward, outer loop updates reward function to optimize task performance. Introduces stochasticity with noise guided by task performance and neural network prediction error to encourage exploration.

Result: Experiments in MuJoCo and Isaac Sim show MORSE effectively balances multiple objectives across robotic tasks, achieving performance comparable to manually tuned reward functions.

Conclusion: MORSE provides a general framework for automatic reward shaping that can handle multi-objective environments without requiring extensive manual reward tuning.

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning, especially in multi-objective environments. In this work, we propose Multi-Objective Reward Shaping with Exploration (MORSE), a general framework that automatically combines multiple human-designed heuristic rewards into a unified reward function. MORSE formulates the shaping process as a bi-level optimization problem: the inner loop trains a policy to maximize the current shaped reward, while the outer loop updates the reward function to optimize task performance. To encourage exploration in the reward space and avoid suboptimal local minima, MORSE introduces stochasticity into the shaping process, injecting noise guided by task performance and the prediction error of a fixed, randomly initialized neural network. Experimental results in MuJoCo and Isaac Sim environments show that MORSE effectively balances multiple objectives across various robotic tasks, achieving task performance comparable to those obtained with manually tuned reward functions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TrajSyn enables server-side adversarial training in Federated Learning by synthesizing proxy datasets from client model update trajectories, improving robustness without accessing raw client data or burdening edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models on edge devices in safety-critical applications are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Federated Learning settings with identical models across thousands of clients face additional challenges: adversarial training is difficult due to client-data privacy constraints and limited edge device compute resources.

Method: TrajSyn is a privacy-preserving framework that synthesizes a proxy dataset from the trajectories of client model updates. This enables effective server-side adversarial training without accessing raw client data, using only the model update information shared during FL.

Result: TrajSyn consistently improves adversarial robustness on image classification benchmarks. The approach achieves this with no extra compute burden on client devices, making it practical for edge deployment.

Conclusion: TrajSyn provides a viable solution for enhancing adversarial robustness in Federated Learning settings while respecting privacy constraints and computational limitations of edge devices, enabling safer deployment of deep learning models in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed on edge devices are increasingly used in safety-critical applications. However, their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations poses significant risks, especially in Federated Learning (FL) settings where identical models are distributed across thousands of clients. While adversarial training is a strong defense, it is difficult to apply in FL due to strict client-data privacy constraints and the limited compute available on edge devices. In this work, we introduce TrajSyn, a privacy-preserving framework that enables effective server-side adversarial training by synthesizing a proxy dataset from the trajectories of client model updates, without accessing raw client data. We show that TrajSyn consistently improves adversarial robustness on image classification benchmarks with no extra compute burden on the client device.

### [141] [From Isolation to Entanglement: When Do Interpretability Methods Identify and Disentangle Known Concepts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15134)
*Aaron Mueller,Andrew Lee,Shruti Joshi,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Dhanya Sridhar,Patrik Reizinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current interpretability methods fail to produce truly disentangled concept representations despite appearing successful under correlational metrics, highlighting the need for compositional evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability methods evaluate concept representations in isolation with implicit independence assumptions, but it's unclear if they actually recover disentangled representations when concepts are correlated in practice.

Method: Proposes multi-concept evaluation with controlled correlations between textual concepts (sentiment, domain, tense). Evaluates featurizers (SAEs, sparse probes) under increasing correlations, measures disentanglement, and performs steering experiments to test independent manipulability.

Result: Found one-to-many relationship: features correspond to at most one concept, but concepts distribute across many features. SAE features affect multiple concepts when steered, indicating lack of selectivity and independence despite affecting disjoint subspaces.

Conclusion: Correlational metrics are insufficient for establishing independence in steering, and affecting disjoint subspaces doesn't guarantee concept selectivity. Compositional evaluations are crucial for interpretability research.

Abstract: A central goal of interpretability is to recover representations of causally relevant concepts from the activations of neural networks. The quality of these concept representations is typically evaluated in isolation, and under implicit independence assumptions that may not hold in practice. Thus, it is unclear whether common featurization methods - including sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and sparse probes - recover disentangled representations of these concepts. This study proposes a multi-concept evaluation setting where we control the correlations between textual concepts, such as sentiment, domain, and tense, and analyze performance under increasing correlations between them. We first evaluate the extent to which featurizers can learn disentangled representations of each concept under increasing correlational strengths. We observe a one-to-many relationship from concepts to features: features correspond to no more than one concept, but concepts are distributed across many features. Then, we perform steering experiments, measuring whether each concept is independently manipulable. Even when trained on uniform distributions of concepts, SAE features generally affect many concepts when steered, indicating that they are neither selective nor independent; nonetheless, features affect disjoint subspaces. These results suggest that correlational metrics for measuring disentanglement are generally not sufficient for establishing independence when steering, and that affecting disjoint subspaces is not sufficient for concept selectivity. These results underscore the importance of compositional evaluations in interpretability research.

### [142] [Generalization and Feature Attribution in Machine Learning Models for Crop Yield and Anomaly Prediction in Germany](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15140)
*Roland Baatz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ML models for crop yield prediction show good test performance but poor temporal generalization, and their SHAP explanations remain seemingly credible even when models fail to generalize, exposing vulnerabilities in post hoc explainability methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the generalization performance and interpretability of ML models for crop yield prediction, particularly addressing the gap between test-set accuracy and temporal validation performance, and to investigate whether interpretability methods remain reliable when models fail to generalize.

Method: Systematic comparison of ensemble tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) and deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN) using high-quality, long-term dataset from Germany's NUTS-3 regions. Evaluation includes both spatially split conventional test sets and temporally independent validation years, with analysis of SHAP feature importance values.

Result: All models perform well on conventional test sets but degrade substantially on temporally independent validation years. Models with strong test-set accuracy but weak temporal validation performance still produce seemingly credible SHAP feature importance values, revealing that interpretability may appear reliable even when models fail to generalize.

Conclusion: Need for validation-aware interpretation of ML predictions in agricultural systems. Feature importance should not be accepted at face value without explicit demonstration of generalization to unseen temporal/spatial conditions. Advocates for domain-aware validation, hybrid modeling strategies, and more rigorous scrutiny of explainability methods in data-driven agriculture.

Abstract: This study examines the generalization performance and interpretability of machine learning (ML) models used for predicting crop yield and yield anomalies in Germany's NUTS-3 regions. Using a high-quality, long-term dataset, the study systematically compares the evaluation and temporal validation behavior of ensemble tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) and deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN).
  While all models perform well on spatially split, conventional test sets, their performance degrades substantially on temporally independent validation years, revealing persistent limitations in generalization. Notably, models with strong test-set accuracy, but weak temporal validation performance can still produce seemingly credible SHAP feature importance values. This exposes a critical vulnerability in post hoc explainability methods: interpretability may appear reliable even when the underlying model fails to generalize.
  These findings underscore the need for validation-aware interpretation of ML predictions in agricultural and environmental systems. Feature importance should not be accepted at face value unless models are explicitly shown to generalize to unseen temporal and spatial conditions. The study advocates for domain-aware validation, hybrid modeling strategies, and more rigorous scrutiny of explainability methods in data-driven agriculture. Ultimately, this work addresses a growing challenge in environmental data science: how can we evaluate generalization robustly enough to trust model explanations?

### [143] [An Efficient Gradient-Based Inference Attack for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15143)
*Pablo Montaña-Fernández,Ines Ortega-Fernandez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new gradient-based membership inference attack for federated learning that exploits temporal evolution of last-layer gradients across multiple rounds, with extension to attribute inference, showing strong performance on various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While federated learning reduces direct data exposure, model updates exchanged between participants and aggregators can still leak sensitive information. Existing attacks may not fully exploit the temporal patterns available in multi-round federated learning scenarios.

Method: Proposes a gradient-based membership inference attack that exploits temporal evolution of last-layer gradients across multiple federated rounds using shadow technique to learn round-wise gradient patterns without accessing private data. Supports both semi-honest and malicious adversaries (aggregators or data owners). Extends to discrete attribute inference by contrasting gradient responses under alternative attribute hypotheses. Model-agnostic approach applicable to any gradient-based model for both classification and regression.

Result: Strong attack performance on CIFAR-100 and Purchase100 datasets for membership inference, and on Breast Cancer Wisconsin for attribute inference. Comparable computational and memory overhead to existing attacks. Multi-round federated learning increases vulnerability, aggregators pose greater threat than data owners, and attack performance depends on dataset nature with richer, high-dimensional data leading to stronger leakage.

Conclusion: Multi-round federated learning can increase vulnerability to inference attacks despite privacy benefits. Aggregators present substantial threat, and dataset characteristics strongly influence attack effectiveness. The proposed attacks demonstrate significant privacy risks in federated learning that need to be addressed.

Abstract: Federated Learning is a machine learning setting that reduces direct data exposure, improving the privacy guarantees of machine learning models. Yet, the exchange of model updates between the participants and the aggregator can still leak sensitive information. In this work, we present a new gradient-based membership inference attack for federated learning scenarios that exploits the temporal evolution of last-layer gradients across multiple federated rounds. Our method uses the shadow technique to learn round-wise gradient patterns of the training records, requiring no access to the private dataset, and is designed to consider both semi-honest and malicious adversaries (aggregators or data owners). Beyond membership inference, we also provide a natural extension of the proposed attack to discrete attribute inference by contrasting gradient responses under alternative attribute hypotheses. The proposed attacks are model-agnostic, and therefore applicable to any gradient-based model and can be applied to both classification and regression settings. We evaluate the attack on CIFAR-100 and Purchase100 datasets for membership inference and on Breast Cancer Wisconsin for attribute inference. Our findings reveal strong attack performance and comparable computational and memory overhead in membership inference when compared to another attack from the literature. The obtained results emphasize that multi-round federated learning can increase the vulnerability to inference attacks, that aggregators pose a more substantial threat than data owners, and that attack performance is strongly influenced by the nature of the training dataset, with richer, high-dimensional data leading to stronger leakage than simpler tabular data.

### [144] [Understanding NTK Variance in Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15169)
*Chengguang Ou,Yixin Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a unified theoretical framework explaining how different INR architectural components affect NTK conditioning and spectral bias through pairwise similarity factors and scaling terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit Neural Representations suffer from slow convergence and poor recovery of high-frequency details due to spectral bias. While prior work connects this to Neural Tangent Kernel behavior, there's unclear understanding of how specific architectural choices affect NTK conditioning.

Method: The authors analyze INR mechanisms through their impact on pairwise similarity factors and scaling terms that determine NTK eigenvalue variance. They derive closed-form variance decompositions for common INR components: positional encoding, spherical normalization, and Hadamard modulation.

Result: Positional encoding reshapes input similarity, spherical normalization reduces variance via layerwise scaling, and Hadamard modulation introduces additional similarity factors below one, yielding multiplicative variance reduction. Experiments confirm predicted variance reductions and show faster, more stable convergence with improved reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified theoretical explanation for how diverse INR architectures mitigate spectral bias by improving NTK conditioning through specific mechanisms that reduce eigenvalue variance, leading to better convergence and reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) often converge slowly and struggle to recover high-frequency details due to spectral bias. While prior work links this behavior to the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), how specific architectural choices affect NTK conditioning remains unclear. We show that many INR mechanisms can be understood through their impact on a small set of pairwise similarity factors and scaling terms that jointly determine NTK eigenvalue variance. For standard coordinate MLPs, limited input-feature interactions induce large eigenvalue dispersion and poor conditioning. We derive closed-form variance decompositions for common INR components and show that positional encoding reshapes input similarity, spherical normalization reduces variance via layerwise scaling, and Hadamard modulation introduces additional similarity factors strictly below one, yielding multiplicative variance reduction. This unified view explains how diverse INR architectures mitigate spectral bias by improving NTK conditioning. Experiments across multiple tasks confirm the predicted variance reductions and demonstrate faster, more stable convergence with improved reconstruction quality.

### [145] [DEER: Draft with Diffusion, Verify with Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15176)
*Zicong Cheng,Guo-Wei Yang,Jia Li,Zhijie Deng,Meng-Hao Guo,Shi-Min Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEER introduces diffusion-based speculative decoding that uses diffusion LLMs as drafters instead of autoregressive models, achieving significantly longer draft acceptance (32 tokens vs 10) and higher speedups (5.54x vs 2.41x).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speculative decoding approaches rely on autoregressive draft models which suffer from step-wise uncertainty accumulation and sequential decoding limitations, leading to limited speedups in LLM-driven systems.

Method: DEER uses diffusion LLMs as drafters with a two-stage training pipeline to align them with target AR models, employing single-step decoding to generate long draft segments, then verifies with AR models.

Result: DEER achieves draft acceptance lengths up to 32 tokens (vs 10 for EAGLE-3) and 5.54x speedup on HumanEval with Qwen3-30B-A3B (vs 2.41x for EAGLE-3).

Conclusion: Diffusion-based drafters overcome fundamental limitations of AR drafters in speculative decoding, enabling significantly higher efficiency and speedups for LLM systems.

Abstract: Efficiency, as a critical practical challenge for LLM-driven agentic and reasoning systems, is increasingly constrained by the inherent latency of autoregressive (AR) decoding. Speculative decoding mitigates this cost through a draft-verify scheme, yet existing approaches rely on AR draft models (a.k.a., drafters), which introduce two fundamental issues: (1) step-wise uncertainty accumulation leads to a progressive collapse of trust between the target model and the drafter, and (2) inherently sequential decoding of AR drafters. Together, these factors cause limited speedups. In this paper, we show that a diffusion large language model (dLLM) drafters can naturally overcome these issues through its fundamentally different probabilistic modeling and efficient parallel decoding strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce DEER, an efficient speculative decoding framework that drafts with diffusion and verifies with AR models. To enable high-quality drafting, DEER employs a two-stage training pipeline to align the dLLM-based drafters with the target AR model, and further adopts single-step decoding to generate long draft segments. Experiments show DEER reaches draft acceptance lengths of up to 32 tokens, far surpassing the 10 tokens achieved by EAGLE-3. Moreover, on HumanEval with Qwen3-30B-A3B, DEER attains a 5.54x speedup, while EAGLE-3 achieves only 2.41x. Code, model, demo, etc, will be available at https://czc726.github.io/DEER/

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chorus: A context-aware, data-free model customization approach for IoT sensor applications that adapts to unseen deployment conditions without target-domain data by learning effective context representations and dynamically integrating them based on context shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world IoT sensor data is collected under diverse and dynamic contextual conditions (sensor placements, ambient environments) that significantly affect data patterns and downstream performance. Traditional domain adaptation/generalization methods often ignore context information or use simplistic integration strategies, making them ineffective for unseen context shifts after deployment.

Method: 1) Unsupervised cross-modal reconstruction between unlabeled sensor data and language-based context embeddings, with regularization to learn robust, generalizable context representations. 2) Trains lightweight gated head on limited labeled samples to dynamically balance sensor and context contributions (favors context when sensor evidence is ambiguous, and vice versa). 3) Context-caching mechanism reuses cached context representations and updates only upon detected context shifts to reduce inference latency.

Result: Experiments on IMU, speech, and WiFi sensing tasks under diverse context shifts show Chorus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 11.3% in unseen contexts, while maintaining comparable latency on smartphone and edge devices.

Conclusion: Chorus provides an effective solution for context-aware model adaptation in IoT applications, enabling robust performance under unseen deployment conditions without requiring target-domain data, with practical deployment efficiency on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: In real-world IoT applications, sensor data is usually collected under diverse and dynamic contextual conditions where factors such as sensor placements or ambient environments can significantly affect data patterns and downstream performance. Traditional domain adaptation or generalization methods often ignore such context information or use simplistic integration strategies, making them ineffective in handling unseen context shifts after deployment. In this paper, we propose Chorus, a context-aware, data-free model customization approach that adapts models to unseen deployment conditions without requiring target-domain data. The key idea is to learn effective context representations that capture their influence on sensor data patterns and to adaptively integrate them based on the degree of context shift. Specifically, Chorus first performs unsupervised cross-modal reconstruction between unlabeled sensor data and language-based context embeddings, while regularizing the context embedding space to learn robust, generalizable context representations. Then, it trains a lightweight gated head on limited labeled samples to dynamically balance sensor and context contributions-favoring context when sensor evidence is ambiguous and vice versa. To further reduce inference latency, Chorus employs a context-caching mechanism that reuses cached context representations and updates only upon detected context shifts. Experiments on IMU, speech, and WiFi sensing tasks under diverse context shifts show that Chorus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 11.3% in unseen contexts, while maintaining comparable latency on smartphone and edge devices.

TL;DR: DBCata is a deep generative model that generates high-fidelity adsorption geometries for catalyst screening without requiring energy/force data, outperforming current ML potentials by 3x in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML interatomic potentials for catalyst screening are unreliable for adsorption energy predictions due to limited training data from near-equilibrium structures, leading to inaccurate adsorption geometries.

Method: Combines periodic Brownian-bridge framework with equivariant graph neural network to create low-dimensional transition manifold between unrelaxed and DFT-relaxed structures, without needing explicit energy/force information. Uses hybrid chemical-heuristic and self-supervised outlier detection for refinement.

Result: Achieves interatomic distance MAE of 0.035 Å on Catalysis-Hub dataset (3x better than state-of-the-art ML potentials). Improves DFT accuracy within 0.1 eV in 94% of cases through anomaly detection and refinement.

Conclusion: DBCata enables accelerated high-throughput screening for alloy catalysts in oxygen reduction reaction, demonstrating potential as powerful tool for catalyst design and optimization.

Abstract: The adsorption energy serves as a crucial descriptor for the large-scale screening of catalysts. Nevertheless, the limited distribution of training data for the extensively utilised machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), predominantly sourced from near-equilibrium structures, results in unreliable adsorption structures and consequent adsorption energy predictions. In this context, we present DBCata, a deep generative model that integrates a periodic Brownian-bridge framework with an equivariant graph neural network to establish a low-dimensional transition manifold between unrelaxed and DFT-relaxed structures, without requiring explicit energy or force information. Upon training, DBCata effectively generates high-fidelity adsorption geometries, achieving an interatomic distance mean absolute error (DMAE) of 0.035 \textÅ on the Catalysis-Hub dataset, which is nearly three times superior to that of the current state-of-the-art machine learning potential models. Moreover, the corresponding DFT accuracy can be improved within 0.1 eV in 94\% of instances by identifying and refining anomalous predictions through a hybrid chemical-heuristic and self-supervised outlier detection approach. We demonstrate that the remarkable performance of DBCata facilitates accelerated high-throughput computational screening for efficient alloy catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction, highlighting the potential of DBCata as a powerful tool for catalyst design and optimisation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physiological signals like ECG and EEG provide complementary health insights but multi-modal integration is challenging due to limited labeled multi-modal data and modality-specific differences.

Method: Adapts CBraMod encoder for large-scale self-supervised ECG pretraining with dual-masking strategy for intra- and inter-lead dependencies. Uses pre-trained CBraMod for EEG and symmetric ECG encoder, then fuses via simple embedding concatenation for classification.

Result: Achieves near state-of-the-art performance on emotion recognition tasks, demonstrating that carefully designed physiological encoders with straightforward fusion substantially improve downstream performance.

Conclusion: Foundation-model approaches can harness the holistic nature of physiological signals, enabling scalable, label-efficient, and generalizable solutions for healthcare and affective computing.

Abstract: Physiological signals such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and electroencephalograms (EEG) provide complementary insights into human health and cognition, yet multi-modal integration is challenging due to limited multi-modal labeled data, and modality-specific differences . In this work, we adapt the CBraMod encoder for large-scale self-supervised ECG pretraining, introducing a dual-masking strategy to capture intra- and inter-lead dependencies. To overcome the above challenges, we utilize a pre-trained CBraMod encoder for EEG and pre-train a symmetric ECG encoder, equipping each modality with a rich foundational representation. These representations are then fused via simple embedding concatenation, allowing the classification head to learn cross-modal interactions, together enabling effective downstream learning despite limited multi-modal supervision. Evaluated on emotion recognition, our approach achieves near state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that carefully designed physiological encoders, even with straightforward fusion, substantially improve downstream performance. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model approaches to harness the holistic nature of physiological signals, enabling scalable, label-efficient, and generalizable solutions for healthcare and affective computing.

TL;DR: SSD improves sparse continual learning by using selective distillation within Top-K subnetworks to enable cross-task knowledge reuse while preserving modularity, without needing replay or task labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse neural systems like SDMLP show resilience to catastrophic forgetting but have rigid modularity that limits cross-task knowledge reuse and causes performance degradation under high sparsity.

Method: Selective Subnetwork Distillation (SSD) identifies high-frequency activation neurons and selectively distills knowledge within previous Top-K subnetworks and output logits, treating distillation as a topology-aligned information conduit rather than a regularizer.

Result: Experiments on Split CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST show SSD improves accuracy, retention, and representation coverage compared to existing sparse continual learning approaches.

Conclusion: SSD provides a structurally grounded solution for sparse continual learning that enables structural realignment while preserving sparse modularity, without requiring replay buffers or task labels.

Abstract: Sparse neural systems are gaining traction for efficient continual learning due to their modularity and low interference. Architectures such as Sparse Distributed Memory Multi-Layer Perceptrons (SDMLP) construct task-specific subnetworks via Top-K activation and have shown resilience against catastrophic forgetting. However, their rigid modularity limits cross-task knowledge reuse and leads to performance degradation under high sparsity. We propose Selective Subnetwork Distillation (SSD), a structurally guided continual learning framework that treats distillation not as a regularizer but as a topology-aligned information conduit. SSD identifies neurons with high activation frequency and selectively distills knowledge within previous Top-K subnetworks and output logits, without requiring replay or task labels. This enables structural realignment while preserving sparse modularity. Experiments on Split CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST demonstrate that SSD improves accuracy, retention, and representation coverage, offering a structurally grounded solution for sparse continual learning.

Motivation: Modern unsupervised/self-supervised learning lacks reliable ways to evaluate embedding quality without labels, creating a need for metrics that can assess geometric structure in a fully unsupervised manner.

Method: Proposes Persistence - a topology-aware metric based on persistent homology that quantifies geometric structure and topological richness of embedding spaces, capturing global and multi-scale organization without assuming linear separability or relying on covariance structure.

Result: Empirical results across diverse domains show Persistence consistently achieves top-tier correlations with downstream performance, outperforming existing unsupervised metrics and enabling reliable model and hyperparameter selection.

Conclusion: Persistence provides an effective unsupervised evaluation metric for embedding spaces that captures topological structure and correlates well with downstream task performance, addressing a key challenge in modern representation learning.

Abstract: Modern representation learning increasingly relies on unsupervised and self-supervised methods trained on large-scale unlabeled data. While these approaches achieve impressive generalization across tasks and domains, evaluating embedding quality without labels remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose Persistence, a topology-aware metric based on persistent homology that quantifies the geometric structure and topological richness of embedding spaces in a fully unsupervised manner. Unlike metrics that assume linear separability or rely on covariance structure, Persistence captures global and multi-scale organization. Empirical results across diverse domains show that Persistence consistently achieves top-tier correlations with downstream performance, outperforming existing unsupervised metrics and enabling reliable model and hyperparameter selection.

Conclusion: QML shows promise for enhancing cybersecurity capabilities but faces limitations that need addressing. The survey provides roadmap for future research directions in quantum-enhanced security solutions.

Abstract: The increasing number of cyber threats and rapidly evolving tactics, as well as the high volume of data in recent years, have caused classical machine learning, rules, and signature-based defence strategies to fail, rendering them unable to keep up.

### [152] [Bits for Privacy: Evaluating Post-Training Quantization via Membership Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15335)
*Chenxiang Zhang,Tongxi Qu,Zhong Li,Tian Zhang,Jun Pang,Sjouke Mauw*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantization reduces privacy leakage in neural networks - lower bit-width models show up to 10x less vulnerability to membership inference attacks, though with some utility trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing privacy analyses focus on full-precision models, leaving a gap in understanding how quantization affects privacy leakage. Quantization is widely used for efficiency but its privacy implications are not well studied.

Method: Systematic study of privacy-utility relationship in post-training quantization (PTQ) using membership inference attacks. Analyzed three PTQ algorithms (AdaRound, BRECQ, OBC) across multiple precision levels (4-bit, 2-bit, 1.58-bit) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets.

Result: Low-precision PTQs consistently reduce privacy leakage. Lower-precision models show up to an order of magnitude reduction in membership inference vulnerability compared to full-precision counterparts. Quantizing only the last layer at higher precision enables fine-grained control over privacy-utility trade-off.

Conclusion: Quantization offers a practical way to balance efficiency, utility, and privacy protection. Practitioners can use lower-precision models to reduce privacy risks while managing the utility trade-off, with selective layer quantization providing additional control.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely deployed with quantization techniques to reduce memory and computational costs by lowering the numerical precision of their parameters. While quantization alters model parameters and their outputs, existing privacy analyses primarily focus on full-precision models, leaving a gap in understanding how bit-width reduction can affect privacy leakage. We present the first systematic study of the privacy-utility relationship in post-training quantization (PTQ), a versatile family of methods that can be applied to pretrained models without further training. Using membership inference attacks as our evaluation framework, we analyze three popular PTQ algorithms-AdaRound, BRECQ, and OBC-across multiple precision levels (4-bit, 2-bit, and 1.58-bit) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets. Our findings consistently show that low-precision PTQs can reduce privacy leakage. In particular, lower-precision models demonstrate up to an order of magnitude reduction in membership inference vulnerability compared to their full-precision counterparts, albeit at the cost of decreased utility. Additional ablation studies on the 1.58-bit quantization level show that quantizing only the last layer at higher precision enables fine-grained control over the privacy-utility trade-off. These results offer actionable insights for practitioners to balance efficiency, utility, and privacy protection in real-world deployments.

### [153] [A Regime-Aware Fusion Framework for Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15378)
*Honey Singh Chauhan,Zahraa S. Abdallah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fusion-3 (F3) adaptively fuses Rocket, Sax, and Sfa representations for time series classification, showing consistent improvements over Rocket alone on specific dataset types identified through meta-feature clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kernel-based methods like Rocket are effective for time series classification but don't perform equally well across all datasets. The paper revisits the intuition that different representations capture complementary structure and aims to show that selective fusion can yield consistent improvements on systematically identifiable dataset types.

Method: Introduces Fusion-3 (F3), a lightweight framework that adaptively fuses Rocket, Sax, and Sfa representations. Clusters UCR datasets into six groups using meta-features (series length, spectral structure, roughness, class imbalance) as interpretable data-structure regimes. Uses three complementary analyses: non-parametric paired statistics, ablation studies, and SHAP attribution to identify which dataset properties predict fusion gains.

Result: Fusion typically outperforms strong baselines in regimes with structured variability or rich frequency content, while offering diminishing returns in highly irregular or outlier-heavy settings. F3 yields small but consistent average improvements over Rocket on 113 UCR datasets, supported by frequentist and Bayesian evidence. Sample-level case studies show fusion primarily improves performance by rescuing specific errors with adaptive frequency-domain weighting.

Conclusion: Selectively applied fusion provides dependable and interpretable extension to strong kernel-based methods, correcting their weaknesses precisely where the data support it. The framework offers consistent improvements while maintaining interpretability through clearly identifiable failure cases and data-structure regimes.

Abstract: Kernel-based methods such as Rocket are among the most effective default approaches for univariate time series classification (TSC), yet they do not perform equally well across all datasets. We revisit the long-standing intuition that different representations capture complementary structure and show that selectively fusing them can yield consistent improvements over Rocket on specific, systematically identifiable kinds of datasets. We introduce Fusion-3 (F3), a lightweight framework that adaptively fuses Rocket, Sax, and Sfa representations. To understand when fusion helps, we cluster UCR datasets into six groups using meta-features capturing series length, spectral structure, roughness, and class imbalance, and treat these clusters as interpretable data-structure regimes. Our analysis shows that fusion typically outperforms strong baselines in regimes with structured variability or rich frequency content, while offering diminishing returns in highly irregular or outlier-heavy settings. To support these findings, we combine three complementary analyses: non-parametric paired statistics across datasets, ablation studies isolating the roles of individual representations, and attribution via SHAP to identify which dataset properties predict fusion gains. Sample-level case studies further reveal the underlying mechanism: fusion primarily improves performance by rescuing specific errors, with adaptive increases in frequency-domain weighting precisely where corrections occur. Using 5-fold cross-validation on the 113 UCR datasets, F3 yields small but consistent average improvements over Rocket, supported by frequentist and Bayesian evidence and accompanied by clearly identifiable failure cases. Our results show that selectively applied fusion provides dependable and interpretable extension to strong kernel-based methods, correcting their weaknesses precisely where the data support it.

*Jianfei Ma,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EUBRL is a Bayesian RL algorithm that uses epistemic uncertainty guidance for principled exploration, achieving near-minimax optimal regret bounds and superior empirical performance on challenging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the fundamental exploration-exploitation dilemma in RL, particularly focusing on epistemic uncertainty (systematic uncertainty due to limited knowledge) at the boundary between known and unknown regions of the environment.

Method: Proposes EUBRL, a Bayesian reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages epistemic guidance to achieve principled exploration. The guidance adaptively reduces per-step regret arising from estimation errors.

Result: Establishes nearly minimax-optimal regret and sample complexity guarantees for a class of sufficiently expressive priors in infinite-horizon discounted MDPs. Empirically demonstrates superior sample efficiency, scalability, and consistency on tasks with sparse rewards, long horizons, and stochasticity.

Conclusion: EUBRL provides a theoretically grounded Bayesian RL approach that effectively leverages epistemic uncertainty for exploration, achieving strong theoretical guarantees and practical performance on challenging RL tasks.

Abstract: At the boundary between the known and the unknown, an agent inevitably confronts the dilemma of whether to explore or to exploit. Epistemic uncertainty reflects such boundaries, representing systematic uncertainty due to limited knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, $\texttt{EUBRL}$, which leverages epistemic guidance to achieve principled exploration. This guidance adaptively reduces per-step regret arising from estimation errors. We establish nearly minimax-optimal regret and sample complexity guarantees for a class of sufficiently expressive priors in infinite-horizon discounted MDPs. Empirically, we evaluate $\texttt{EUBRL}$ on tasks characterized by sparse rewards, long horizons, and stochasticity. Results demonstrate that $\texttt{EUBRL}$ achieves superior sample efficiency, scalability, and consistency.

### [155] [FlowBind: Efficient Any-to-Any Generation with Bidirectional Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15420)
*Yeonwoo Cha,Semin Kim,Jinhyeon Kwon,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowBind is an efficient any-to-any generation framework that uses shared latent space with modality-specific invertible flows, achieving competitive quality with fewer parameters and faster training than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-based approaches for any-to-any generation suffer from inefficiency: they require large datasets with restrictive pairing constraints, incur high computational costs from modeling joint distributions, and rely on complex multi-stage training.

Method: FlowBind learns a shared latent space capturing cross-modal information, with modality-specific invertible flows bridging this latent to each modality. Both components are optimized jointly under a single flow-matching objective, and at inference the invertible flows act as encoders/decoders for direct translation.

Result: Experiments on text, image, and audio demonstrate that FlowBind attains comparable quality while requiring up to 6x fewer parameters and training 10x faster than prior methods.

Conclusion: FlowBind provides an efficient framework for any-to-any generation that substantially reduces data requirements and computational cost while maintaining competitive generation quality through its shared latent space and modality-specific invertible flows approach.

Abstract: Any-to-any generation seeks to translate between arbitrary subsets of modalities, enabling flexible cross-modal synthesis. Despite recent success, existing flow-based approaches are challenged by their inefficiency, as they require large-scale datasets often with restrictive pairing constraints, incur high computational cost from modeling joint distribution, and rely on complex multi-stage training. We propose FlowBind, an efficient framework for any-to-any generation. Our approach is distinguished by its simplicity: it learns a shared latent space capturing cross-modal information, with modality-specific invertible flows bridging this latent to each modality. Both components are optimized jointly under a single flow-matching objective, and at inference the invertible flows act as encoders and decoders for direct translation across modalities. By factorizing interactions through the shared latent, FlowBind naturally leverages arbitrary subsets of modalities for training, and achieves competitive generation quality while substantially reducing data requirements and computational cost. Experiments on text, image, and audio demonstrate that FlowBind attains comparable quality while requiring up to 6x fewer parameters and training 10x faster than prior methods.

Motivation: Random matrix theory is important in mathematics, physics, and machine learning. In data science, input data are typically normalized before processing, creating a need to understand the statistical properties of min-max normalized eigenvalues in random matrices.

Method: The study applies previously proposed effective distribution for normalized eigenvalues to evaluate scaling laws of cumulative distributions.

Abstract: Random matrix theory has played an important role in various areas of pure mathematics, mathematical physics, and machine learning. From a practical perspective of data science, input data are usually normalized prior to processing. Thus, this study investigates the statistical properties of min-max normalized eigenvalues in random matrices. Previously, the effective distribution for such normalized eigenvalues has been proposed. In this study, we apply it to evaluate a scaling law of the cumulative distribution. Furthermore, we derive the residual error that arises during matrix factorization of random matrices. We conducted numerical experiments to verify these theoretical predictions.

TL;DR: FM-EAC integrates model-based and model-free RL with feature-based models for improved multi-task transferability in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern RL methods struggle with effective transferability across tasks and scenarios, despite the convergence of MBRL and MFRL approaches in Dyna-Q.

Method: Proposes FM-EAC (Feature Model-Based Enhanced Actor-Critic) that integrates planning, acting, and learning using novel feature-based models and an enhanced actor-critic framework.

Result: FM-EAC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MBRL and MFRL methods in urban and agricultural applications, and allows customization of sub-networks for user-specific requirements.

Conclusion: FM-EAC successfully combines MBRL and MFRL strengths to improve generalizability and transferability across dynamic multi-task environments.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) evolve along distinct paths but converge in the design of Dyna-Q [1]. However, modern RL methods still struggle with effective transferability across tasks and scenarios. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a generalized algorithm, Feature Model-Based Enhanced Actor-Critic (FM-EAC), that integrates planning, acting, and learning for multi-task control in dynamic environments. FM-EAC combines the strengths of MBRL and MFRL and improves generalizability through the use of novel feature-based models and an enhanced actor-critic framework. Simulations in both urban and agricultural applications demonstrate that FM-EAC consistently outperforms many state-of-the-art MBRL and MFRL methods. More importantly, different sub-networks can be customized within FM-EAC according to user-specific requirements.

### [158] [Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15439)
*Akihiro Kubo,Paavo Parmas,Shin Ishii*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DHMBPO proposes a double-horizon approach in model-based RL with separate distribution rollouts (long) for on-policy sampling and training rollouts (short) for stable gradient estimation, achieving better sample efficiency and runtime than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBRL faces a dilemma in choosing rollout length: longer rollouts preserve on-policy training but amplify model bias, while also creating a trade-off between value estimation bias and policy gradient variance. The optimal horizons for these two conflicting objectives differ.

Method: Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization (DHMBPO) divides rollout procedure into: (1) long "distribution rollout" (DR) to generate on-policy state samples for mitigating distribution shift, and (2) short "training rollout" (TR) that uses differentiable transitions for accurate value gradient estimation with stable updates, requiring fewer updates and reducing runtime.

Result: The double-horizon approach effectively balances distribution shift, model bias, and gradient instability, and surpasses existing MBRL methods on continuous-control benchmarks in both sample efficiency and runtime.

Conclusion: Separating rollout horizons for different purposes (distribution alignment vs. gradient estimation) resolves the conflict between competing objectives in MBRL, leading to improved performance and efficiency in continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) reduces the cost of real-environment sampling by generating synthetic trajectories (called rollouts) from a learned dynamics model. However, choosing the length of the rollouts poses two dilemmas: (1) Longer rollouts better preserve on-policy training but amplify model bias, indicating the need for an intermediate horizon to mitigate distribution shift (i.e., the gap between on-policy and past off-policy samples). (2) Moreover, a longer model rollout may reduce value estimation bias but raise the variance of policy gradients due to backpropagation through multiple steps, implying another intermediate horizon for stable gradient estimates. However, these two optimal horizons may differ. To resolve this conflict, we propose Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization (DHMBPO), which divides the rollout procedure into a long "distribution rollout" (DR) and a short "training rollout" (TR). The DR generates on-policy state samples for mitigating distribution shift. In contrast, the short TR leverages differentiable transitions to offer accurate value gradient estimation with stable gradient updates, thereby requiring fewer updates and reducing overall runtime. We demonstrate that the double-horizon approach effectively balances distribution shift, model bias, and gradient instability, and surpasses existing MBRL methods on continuous-control benchmarks in terms of both sample efficiency and runtime.

TL;DR: The paper explores using chain-of-thought and task instruction prompting combined with negative prompting and prompt re-writing to reduce copyrighted content generation in text-to-image models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models can memorize and reproduce copyrighted training data, creating legal and financial risks for both users and developers. There's a need for techniques to mitigate copyright infringement in AI-generated content.

Method: Combines chain-of-thought and task instruction prompting with two existing copyright mitigation strategies: negative prompting and prompt re-writing. Evaluates generated images based on similarity to copyrighted content and relevance to user input.

Result: Presents numerical experiments across various models, providing insights on the effectiveness of these techniques for models of different complexity levels.

Conclusion: The proposed combination of chain-of-thought prompting, task instruction, negative prompting, and prompt re-writing shows promise for reducing copyrighted content generation in text-to-image models, with effectiveness varying by model complexity.

Abstract: Large scale text-to-image generation models can memorize and reproduce their training dataset. Since the training dataset often contains copyrighted material, reproduction of training dataset poses a copyright infringement risk, which could result in legal liabilities and financial losses for both the AI user and the developer. The current works explores the potential of chain-of-thought and task instruction prompting in reducing copyrighted content generation. To this end, we present a formulation that combines these two techniques with two other copyright mitigation strategies: a) negative prompting, and b) prompt re-writing. We study the generated images in terms their similarity to a copyrighted image and their relevance of the user input. We present numerical experiments on a variety of models and provide insights on the effectiveness of the aforementioned techniques for varying model complexity.

*Xiangrui Xu,Zhize Li,Yufei Han,Bin Wang,Jiqiang Liu,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Invertibility Loss (InvLoss) as a theoretical framework to quantify data reconstruction attack risk in federated learning, develops a risk estimator (InvRE), and proposes adaptive noise defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current federated learning systems lack a theoretically-grounded framework to characterize and assess the risk of data reconstruction attacks, which can infer sensitive training data from local clients.

Method: Introduces Invertibility Loss (InvLoss) to quantify maximum achievable DRA effectiveness, derives a tight computable upper bound, develops InvRE risk estimator, and proposes two adaptive noise perturbation defenses.

Result: Shows DRA risk is governed by spectral properties of Jacobian matrices, provides unified explanation for defense effectiveness, validates framework on real-world datasets with comprehensive risk evaluation.

Conclusion: The InvLoss framework enables systematic DRA risk evaluation and mitigation in FL systems, offering attack-agnostic risk assessment and privacy-enhancing defenses without harming classification accuracy.

Abstract: Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRA) pose a significant threat to Federated Learning (FL) systems by enabling adversaries to infer sensitive training data from local clients. Despite extensive research, the question of how to characterize and assess the risk of DRAs in FL systems remains unresolved due to the lack of a theoretically-grounded risk quantification framework. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Invertibility Loss (InvLoss) to quantify the maximum achievable effectiveness of DRAs for a given data instance and FL model. We derive a tight and computable upper bound for InvLoss and explore its implications from three perspectives. First, we show that DRA risk is governed by the spectral properties of the Jacobian matrix of exchanged model updates or feature embeddings, providing a unified explanation for the effectiveness of defense methods. Second, we develop InvRE, an InvLoss-based DRA risk estimator that offers attack method-agnostic, comprehensive risk evaluation across data instances and model architectures. Third, we propose two adaptive noise perturbation defenses that enhance FL privacy without harming classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate our framework, demonstrating its potential for systematic DRA risk evaluation and mitigation in FL systems.

*Ioannis Kalogeropoulos,Giorgos Bouritsas,Yannis Panagakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework using graph metanetworks to efficiently edit neural networks to satisfy various requirements (fairness, privacy, efficiency) without sacrificing performance, outperforming traditional post-processing and retraining methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As ML models are deployed in high-stakes settings, there's a need to ensure they satisfy diverse requirements beyond performance (fairness, compliance, computational constraints). Traditional approaches like post-processing compromise performance, while retraining is time-consuming or unavailable.

Method: A data-driven framework where a graph metanetwork (itself an NN) learns to edit other NNs in a single inference step. The metanetwork is trained on NN populations to minimize an objective with two terms: requirement enforcement and utility preservation.

Result: Experiments on diverse tasks (data minimization, bias mitigation, weight pruning) show improved trade-offs between performance, requirement satisfaction, and time efficiency compared to popular post-processing or re-training alternatives.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables efficient model editing to satisfy various requirements without sacrificing utility, offering a practical solution for deploying ML models in high-stakes settings with multiple constraints.

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings, e.g. as decision support systems in various societal sectors or in critical infrastructure, designers and auditors are facing the need to ensure that models satisfy a wider variety of requirements (e.g. compliance with regulations, fairness, computational constraints) beyond performance. Although most of them are the subject of ongoing studies, typical approaches face critical challenges: post-processing methods tend to compromise performance, which is often counteracted by fine-tuning or, worse, training from scratch, an often time-consuming or even unavailable strategy. This raises the following question: "Can we efficiently edit models to satisfy requirements, without sacrificing their utility?" In this work, we approach this with a unifying framework, in a data-driven manner, i.e. we learn to edit neural networks (NNs), where the editor is an NN itself - a graph metanetwork - and editing amounts to a single inference step. In particular, the metanetwork is trained on NN populations to minimise an objective consisting of two terms: the requirement to be enforced and the preservation of the NN's utility. We experiment with diverse tasks (the data minimisation principle, bias mitigation and weight pruning) improving the trade-offs between performance, requirement satisfaction and time efficiency compared to popular post-processing or re-training alternatives.

TL;DR: Geometric algebra neural networks provide soft geometric inductive bias for object-centric world models, outperforming non-equivariant baselines in physical fidelity for long-horizon rigid body dynamics with obstacles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact group equivariance can degrade performance when symmetries are broken in physical dynamics, so a softer geometric inductive bias is needed for robust generalization.

Method: Object-centric world models built with geometric algebra neural networks, trained autoregressively for next-step predictions in simulated 2D rigid body dynamics with static obstacles.

Result: Soft geometric inductive bias results in better performance in terms of physical fidelity for long-horizon rollouts compared to non-equivariant baseline models.

Conclusion: Geometric algebra offers an effective middle ground between hand-crafted physics and unstructured deep nets, delivering sample-efficient dynamics models for multi-object scenes with robust generalization.

Abstract: Equivariance is a powerful prior for learning physical dynamics, yet exact group equivariance can degrade performance if the symmetries are broken. We propose object-centric world models built with geometric algebra neural networks, providing a soft geometric inductive bias. Our models are evaluated using simulated environments of 2d rigid body dynamics with static obstacles, where we train for next-step predictions autoregressively. For long-horizon rollouts we show that the soft inductive bias of our models results in better performance in terms of physical fidelity compared to non-equivariant baseline models. The approach complements recent soft-equivariance ideas and aligns with the view that simple, well-chosen priors can yield robust generalization. These results suggest that geometric algebra offers an effective middle ground between hand-crafted physics and unstructured deep nets, delivering sample-efficient dynamics models for multi-object scenes.

*Luca Torresi,Pascal Friederich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an extension to Bayesian optimization that enables flexible sampling of multi-stage workflows using proxy measurements, improving optimization efficiency in self-driving labs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Bayesian optimization in self-driving labs requires fixed experimental workflows without on-the-fly decisions or intermediate measurements, forcing simplification of real-world experiments. This limitation prevents using complex, realistic workflows that could benefit from intermediate observables.

Method: The authors develop an extension to Bayesian optimization that allows flexible sampling of multi-stage workflows and incorporates proxy measurements (intermediate observables) into the decision-making process.

Result: Proxy measurements yield substantial improvement over conventional Bayesian optimization across a wide range of scenarios, both in time to find good solutions and overall optimality of found solutions.

Conclusion: This approach enables more complex and realistic experimental workflows in autonomous labs and facilitates smooth combination of simulations and experiments in next-generation self-driving laboratories.

Abstract: Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) are combining recent technological advances in robotics, automation, and machine learning based data analysis and decision-making to perform autonomous experimentation toward human-directed goals without requiring any direct human intervention. SDLs are successfully used in materials science, chemistry, and beyond, to optimise processes, materials, and devices in a systematic and data-efficient way. At present, the most widely used algorithm to identify the most informative next experiment is Bayesian optimisation. While relatively simple to apply to a wide range of optimisation problems, standard Bayesian optimisation relies on a fixed experimental workflow with a clear set of optimisation parameters and one or more measurable objective functions. This excludes the possibility of making on-the-fly decisions about changes in the planned sequence of operations and including intermediate measurements in the decision-making process. Therefore, many real-world experiments need to be adapted and simplified to be converted to the common setting in self-driving labs. In this paper, we introduce an extension to Bayesian optimisation that allows flexible sampling of multi-stage workflows and makes optimal decisions based on intermediate observables, which we call proxy measurements. We systematically compare the advantage of taking into account proxy measurements over conventional Bayesian optimisation, in which only the final measurement is observed. We find that over a wide range of scenarios, proxy measurements yield a substantial improvement, both in the time to find good solutions and in the overall optimality of found solutions. This not only paves the way to use more complex and thus more realistic experimental workflows in autonomous labs but also to smoothly combine simulations and experiments in the next generation of SDLs.

*Alexandre Dussolle,Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces N-simplicial attention, extending graph attention from pairwise to higher-order interactions, with cost-effective simplex selection and adaptation to RoPE, while analyzing its Lipschitz properties and over-smoothing issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art models use graph message-passing mechanisms (like GATs or Transformers) with pairwise token interactions, but there's potential to improve performance by moving to higher-order interactions beyond pairwise similarity.

Method: Introduces N-simplicial attention that extends attention mechanisms from pairwise token similarity to higher-order interactions, adapts it for Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), and proposes a cost-effective simplex selection mechanism to manage computational complexity by focusing on task-sensitive interactions.

Result: The paper derives a Lipschitz upper-bound for N-simplicial attention and demonstrates that despite enabling higher-order interactions, it still suffers from over-smoothing issues similar to traditional attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: N-simplicial attention provides a framework for higher-order interactions in attention mechanisms with computational efficiency through simplex selection, but inherits over-smoothing challenges that need to be addressed in future work.

Abstract: Going from pure Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to a learnable graph message-passing mechanism at each layer has been foundational to state-of-the-art results, despite the computational trade-off (e.g. GATs or Transformers). To go a step further, in this work, we introduce N-simplicial attention, going from pairwise token similarity to higher-order interactions, and adapt it for Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). To help manage the increased complexity, we propose a cost-effective simplex selection enabling the model to focus its computation load onto the more task-sensitive interactions. Beyond these core mechanisms, we study how smoothing N-simplicial attention is by deriving a Lipschitz upper-bound and by demonstrating that by itself it also suffers from over-smoothing, despite opening the attention message-passing to higher-order interactions.

TL;DR: The paper compares Robustness Quantification (RQ) and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for assessing classifier prediction reliability, finds they are complementary, and proposes a hybrid approach that outperforms both.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and compare two different approaches for assessing the reliability of individual classifier predictions - Robustness Quantification and Uncertainty Quantification - and determine which is more effective or if they can be combined.

Method: The authors compare RQ and UQ approaches on multiple benchmark datasets, analyze their performance, and develop a hybrid approach that combines both methods to leverage their complementary strengths.

Result: No clear winner between RQ and UQ alone, but they are complementary. The hybrid approach combining both outperforms either individual method. The analysis also provides assessment of relative importance of uncertainty vs. robustness as sources of unreliability for each dataset.

Conclusion: RQ and UQ are complementary approaches for reliability assessment, and combining them in a hybrid framework yields superior performance. The relative importance of uncertainty vs. robustness varies across datasets, providing insights into different sources of prediction unreliability.

Abstract: We consider two conceptually different approaches for assessing the reliability of the individual predictions of a classifier: Robustness Quantification (RQ) and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). We compare both approaches on a number of benchmark datasets and show that there is no clear winner between the two, but that they are complementary and can be combined to obtain a hybrid approach that outperforms both RQ and UQ. As a byproduct of our approach, for each dataset, we also obtain an assessment of the relative importance of uncertainty and robustness as sources of unreliability.

TL;DR: A method using infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes with Random Fourier Features to model and track temporal evolution of vector sets across domains like ecology, crime analysis, and linguistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing time-varying sets of vectors is challenging due to their complex evolving structures, yet crucial for understanding dynamic systems in ecology (ecosystem interactions), crime analysis (spatial distribution shifts), and linguistics (cultural/semantic trends in word embeddings).

Method: Proposes modeling the distribution underlying each set of vectors using infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes, approximating the latent function with Random Fourier Features to obtain compact, comparable vector representations over time.

Result: The method successfully tracks and visualizes temporal transitions of vector sets in low-dimensional space, applied to sociological (crime distributions) and linguistic (word embeddings) data, capturing temporal dynamics effectively.

Conclusion: The approach provides interpretable and robust representations, offering a powerful framework for analyzing structural changes in temporally indexed vector sets across diverse domains.

Abstract: Understanding the temporal evolution of sets of vectors is a fundamental challenge across various domains, including ecology, crime analysis, and linguistics. For instance, ecosystem structures evolve due to interactions among plants, herbivores, and carnivores; the spatial distribution of crimes shifts in response to societal changes; and word embedding vectors reflect cultural and semantic trends over time. However, analyzing such time-varying sets of vectors is challenging due to their complicated structures, which also evolve over time. In this work, we propose a novel method for modeling the distribution underlying each set of vectors using infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes. By approximating the latent function in the Gaussian process with Random Fourier Features, we obtain compact and comparable vector representations over time. This enables us to track and visualize temporal transitions of vector sets in a low-dimensional space. We apply our method to both sociological data (crime distributions) and linguistic data (word embeddings), demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing temporal dynamics. Our results show that the proposed approach provides interpretable and robust representations, offering a powerful framework for analyzing structural changes in temporally indexed vector sets across diverse domains.

### [167] [Can LLMs Guide Their Own Exploration? Gradient-Guided Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15687)
*Zhenwen Liang,Sidi Lu,Wenhao Yu,Kishan Panaganti,Yujun Zhou,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G2RL is a gradient-guided RL framework that uses the model's own update geometry (via final layer sensitivity features) to guide exploration, outperforming entropy-based methods on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL exploration mechanisms (entropy bonuses, external semantic comparators) are misaligned with how LLMs actually learn - they encourage surface-level variation but don't guarantee differences in the gradient update directions that shape optimization.

Method: G2RL constructs sequence-level features from the model's final layer sensitivity (obtainable at negligible cost from a standard forward pass), measures how each trajectory would reshape the policy by comparing these features within sampled groups, and gives bounded multiplicative reward scalers to trajectories that introduce novel gradient directions while deemphasizing redundant updates.

Result: Across math and general reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, AMC, AIME24, AIME25, GPQA, MMLUpro) on Qwen3 base 1.7B and 4B models, G2RL consistently improves pass@1, maj@16, and pass@k over entropy-based GRPO and external embedding methods.

Conclusion: A policy's own update space provides a far more faithful and effective basis for guiding exploration in LLM reinforcement learning, as G2RL expands exploration into substantially more orthogonal and often opposing gradient directions while maintaining semantic coherence.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become essential for strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet current exploration mechanisms remain fundamentally misaligned with how these models actually learn. Entropy bonuses and external semantic comparators encourage surface level variation but offer no guarantee that sampled trajectories differ in the update directions that shape optimization. We propose G2RL, a gradient guided reinforcement learning framework in which exploration is driven not by external heuristics but by the model own first order update geometry. For each response, G2RL constructs a sequence level feature from the model final layer sensitivity, obtainable at negligible cost from a standard forward pass, and measures how each trajectory would reshape the policy by comparing these features within a sampled group. Trajectories that introduce novel gradient directions receive a bounded multiplicative reward scaler, while redundant or off manifold updates are deemphasized, yielding a self referential exploration signal that is naturally aligned with PPO style stability and KL control. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, AMC, AIME24, AIME25, GPQA, MMLUpro) on Qwen3 base 1.7B and 4B models, G2RL consistently improves pass@1, maj@16, and pass@k over entropy based GRPO and external embedding methods. Analyzing the induced geometry, we find that G2RL expands exploration into substantially more orthogonal and often opposing gradient directions while maintaining semantic coherence, revealing that a policy own update space provides a far more faithful and effective basis for guiding exploration in large language model reinforcement learning.

### [168] [Joint Learning of Unsupervised Multi-view Feature and Instance Co-selection with Cross-view Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15574)
*Yuxin Cai,Yanyong Huang,Jinyuan Chang,Dongjie Wang,Tianrui Li,Xiaoyi Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JUICE is a novel unsupervised multi-view feature and instance co-selection method that jointly handles missing data imputation and co-selection in a unified framework, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat co-selection and missing data imputation as independent processes when dealing with unlabeled incomplete multi-view data, overlooking their potential interactions. Simply concatenating multi-view data also fails to capture complementary information among views, limiting co-selection effectiveness.

Method: JUICE jointly learns unsupervised multi-view feature and instance co-selection with cross-view imputation. It first reconstructs incomplete multi-view data using available observations, bringing missing data recovery and co-selection together in a unified framework. Then leverages cross-view neighborhood information to learn inter-sample relationships and refine missing value imputation during reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that JUICE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in selecting more representative features and instances from incomplete multi-view data.

Conclusion: The proposed JUICE framework successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by jointly handling missing data imputation and feature/instance co-selection, enabling better utilization of cross-view complementary information and improving overall co-selection performance.

Abstract: Feature and instance co-selection, which aims to reduce both feature dimensionality and sample size by identifying the most informative features and instances, has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, when dealing with unlabeled incomplete multi-view data, where some samples are missing in certain views, existing methods typically first impute the missing data and then concatenate all views into a single dataset for subsequent co-selection. Such a strategy treats co-selection and missing data imputation as two independent processes, overlooking potential interactions between them. The inter-sample relationships gleaned from co-selection can aid imputation, which in turn enhances co-selection performance. Additionally, simply merging multi-view data fails to capture the complementary information among views, ultimately limiting co-selection effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel co-selection method, termed Joint learning of Unsupervised multI-view feature and instance Co-selection with cross-viEw imputation (JUICE). JUICE first reconstructs incomplete multi-view data using available observations, bringing missing data recovery and feature and instance co-selection together in a unified framework. Then, JUICE leverages cross-view neighborhood information to learn inter-sample relationships and further refine the imputation of missing values during reconstruction. This enables the selection of more representative features and instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JUICE outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

*Shuibai Zhang,Fred Zhangzhi Peng,Yiheng Zhang,Jin Pan,Grigorios G. Chrysos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a correction-oriented training approach for diffusion language models to enable better error localization and iterative refinement, outperforming standard masked diffusion models on code revision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard masked diffusion language models fail to reliably identify and correct errors in sequences, as they cannot properly distinguish unreliable tokens from correct ones, making confidence-guided refinement ineffective for iterative error correction.

Method: The authors propose a correction-oriented post-training principle that explicitly supervises visible incorrect tokens to enable error-aware confidence estimation and targeted refinement, and introduce the Code Revision Benchmark (CRB) for evaluation.

Result: Models trained with the proposed approach substantially outperform standard masked diffusion language models in correction scenarios while also improving pure completion performance on code revision tasks and controlled settings.

Conclusion: The correction-oriented training approach successfully enables diffusion language models to develop effective error localization and iterative refinement capabilities, addressing limitations of conventional masked diffusion objectives for correction tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion language models are structurally well-suited for iterative error correction, as their non-causal denoising dynamics allow arbitrary positions in a sequence to be revised. However, standard masked diffusion language model (MDLM) training fails to reliably induce this behavior, as models often cannot identify unreliable tokens in a complete input, rendering confidence-guided refinement ineffective. We study corrective behavior in diffusion language models, defined as the ability to assign lower confidence to incorrect tokens and iteratively refine them while preserving correct content. We show that this capability is not induced by conventional masked diffusion objectives and propose a correction-oriented post-training principle that explicitly supervises visible incorrect tokens, enabling error-aware confidence and targeted refinement. To evaluate corrective behavior, we introduce the Code Revision Benchmark (CRB), a controllable and executable benchmark for assessing error localization and in-place correction. Experiments on code revision tasks and controlled settings demonstrate that models trained with our approach substantially outperform standard MDLMs in correction scenarios, while also improving pure completion performance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangshuibai/CDLM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes a mathematical equivalence between autoregressive models (ARMs) and energy-based models (EBMs) for language modeling, showing they're connected through the chain rule of probability and soft Bellman equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While ARMs dominate current LLMs, EBMs naturally characterize optimal alignment policies. The paper aims to unify these two model classes to understand their relationships and provide theoretical insights.

Method: Starting from the chain rule of probability, the authors establish an explicit bijection between ARMs and EBMs in function space, showing this corresponds to a special case of soft Bellman equations in maximum entropy reinforcement learning.

Result: The paper proves equivalence between supervised learning of ARMs and EBMs, provides theoretical error bounds for distilling EBMs into ARMs, and offers insights into ARMs' planning capabilities despite next-token prediction.

Conclusion: The unified view reveals deep connections between ARMs and EBMs, explaining how ARMs can effectively plan ahead and providing theoretical foundations for model distillation and alignment.

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) currently constitute the dominant paradigm for large language models (LLMs). Energy-based models (EBMs) represent another class of models, which have historically been less prevalent in LLM development, yet naturally characterize the optimal policy in post-training alignment. In this paper, we provide a unified view of these two model classes. Taking the chain rule of probability as a starting point, we establish an explicit bijection between ARMs and EBMs in function space, which we show to correspond to a special case of the soft Bellman equation in maximum entropy reinforcement learning. Building upon this bijection, we derive the equivalence between supervised learning of ARMs and EBMs. Furthermore, we analyze the distillation of EBMs into ARMs by providing theoretical error bounds. Our results provide insights into the ability of ARMs to plan ahead, despite being based on the next-token prediction paradigm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BEAT is a framework that tokenizes user-item behaviors into interpretable sequences using vector-quantized autoencoding, enabling better zero-shot recommendations and coherent explanations by aligning behavior tokens with frozen language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explainable recommendation methods rely on ID-based representations that obscure semantic meaning and impose structural constraints on language models, limiting applicability in open-ended scenarios. Real-world interactions involve entangled user intents and misalignment between collaborative signals and linguistic semantics.

Method: BEAT tokenizes user and item behaviors into discrete sequences using a behavior vocabulary constructed via vector-quantized autoencoding that disentangles macro-level interests and micro-level intentions from graph-based representations. It uses multi-level semantic supervision and semantic alignment regularization to embed behavior tokens directly into frozen language models' input space.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets show BEAT improves zero-shot recommendation performance while generating coherent and informative explanations. Behavior tokens capture fine-grained semantics and offer a plug-and-play interface for integrating complex behavior patterns into large language models.

Conclusion: BEAT provides a unified and transferable framework that overcomes limitations of ID-based representations by creating interpretable behavior tokens that bridge behavioral signals with language space, enabling better explainable recommendations in open-ended scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in explainable recommendations have explored the integration of language models to analyze natural language rationales for user-item interactions. Despite their potential, existing methods often rely on ID-based representations that obscure semantic meaning and impose structural constraints on language models, thereby limiting their applicability in open-ended scenarios. These challenges are intensified by the complex nature of real-world interactions, where diverse user intents are entangled and collaborative signals rarely align with linguistic semantics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BEAT, a unified and transferable framework that tokenizes user and item behaviors into discrete, interpretable sequences. We construct a behavior vocabulary via a vector-quantized autoencoding process that disentangles macro-level interests and micro-level intentions from graph-based representations. We then introduce multi-level semantic supervision to bridge the gap between behavioral signals and language space. A semantic alignment regularization mechanism is designed to embed behavior tokens directly into the input space of frozen language models. Experiments on three public datasets show that BEAT improves zero-shot recommendation performance while generating coherent and informative explanations. Further analysis demonstrates that our behavior tokens capture fine-grained semantics and offer a plug-and-play interface for integrating complex behavior patterns into large language models.

TL;DR: SoFlow enables one-step image generation by combining Flow Matching loss and solution consistency loss, outperforming MeanFlow on ImageNet 256x256 with better FID scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-step denoising in diffusion and Flow Matching models causes efficiency problems, motivating research on few-step generation to improve computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes Solution Flow Models (SoFlow) with two losses: Flow Matching loss for velocity field estimation (enabling Classifier-Free Guidance) and solution consistency loss that avoids Jacobian-vector product computation.

Result: When trained from scratch using DiT architecture with equal training epochs, SoFlow achieves better FID-50K scores than MeanFlow models on ImageNet 256x256 dataset.

Conclusion: SoFlow provides an efficient one-step generation framework that improves performance while avoiding computationally expensive Jacobian-vector product calculations.

Abstract: The multi-step denoising process in diffusion and Flow Matching models causes major efficiency issues, which motivates research on few-step generation. We present Solution Flow Models (SoFlow), a framework for one-step generation from scratch. By analyzing the relationship between the velocity function and the solution function of the velocity ordinary differential equation (ODE), we propose a Flow Matching loss and a solution consistency loss to train our models. The Flow Matching loss allows our models to provide estimated velocity fields for Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) during training, which improves generation performance. Notably, our consistency loss does not require the calculation of the Jacobian-vector product (JVP), a common requirement in recent works that is not well-optimized in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch. Experimental results indicate that, when trained from scratch using the same Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture and an equal number of training epochs, our models achieve better FID-50K scores than MeanFlow models on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for effective anomaly detection in water distribution networks to identify leaks and sensor malfunctions without requiring calibrated hydraulic models, enabling real-world operational applications.

Method: Processes heterogeneous pressure/flow data through whitening transformation to eliminate spatial correlations, constructs Hotelling's T² statistic for anomaly detection as statistical hypothesis test, develops heuristic algorithm to classify anomalies (abrupt/incipient leaks, sensor malfunctions), and proposes coarse localization using sensor statistical contributions and Laplacian interpolation.

Result: Applied to BattLeDIM L-Town benchmark dataset, demonstrates high sensitivity and reliability in leak detection, maintains robust performance under multiple leaks, and enables approximate water loss estimation via regression model.

Conclusion: SICAMS provides unified framework for anomaly management in water networks without requiring calibrated hydraulic models, making it applicable to real-world operational environments with demonstrated effectiveness in detection, classification, and preliminary localization.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework, for the detection, classification, and preliminary localization of anomalies in water distribution networks using multivariate statistical analysis. The approach, termed SICAMS (Statistical Identification and Classification of Anomalies in Mahalanobis Space), processes heterogeneous pressure and flow sensor data through a whitening transformation to eliminate spatial correlations among measurements. Based on the transformed data, the Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic is constructed, enabling the formulation of anomaly detection as a statistical hypothesis test of network conformity to normal operating conditions. It is shown that Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic can serve as an integral indicator of the overall "health" of the system, exhibiting correlation with total leakage volume, and thereby enabling approximate estimation of water losses via a regression model. A heuristic algorithm is developed to analyze the $T^2$ time series and classify detected anomalies into abrupt leaks, incipient leaks, and sensor malfunctions. Furthermore, a coarse leak localization method is proposed, which ranks sensors according to their statistical contribution and employs Laplacian interpolation to approximate the affected region within the network. Application of the proposed framework to the BattLeDIM L-Town benchmark dataset demonstrates high sensitivity and reliability in leak detection, maintaining robust performance even under multiple leaks. These capabilities make the method applicable to real-world operational environments without the need for a calibrated hydraulic model.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on tasks with known optimal solutions, but there's a need to evaluate AI models on frontier computer science problems where optimal solutions are unknown but solution quality can be objectively measured.

Method: Created 156 open-ended problems across diverse CS areas, designed/reviewed by experts (CS PhDs, competitive programmers). Includes algorithmic problems (often NP-hard variants) and research problems with objective partial scoring. Each problem has expert reference solution and automatic evaluator.

Result: Models still lag far behind human experts on both algorithmic and research tracks. Increasing reasoning budgets alone doesn't close the gap. Models often over-optimize for generating merely workable code instead of discovering high-quality algorithms and system designs.

Conclusion: FrontierCS provides a benchmark at the frontier of computer-science difficulty that combines open-ended design, measurable progress, and expert curation, revealing significant gaps between current AI models and human expert performance on challenging CS problems.

Abstract: We introduce FrontierCS, a benchmark of 156 open-ended problems across diverse areas of computer science, designed and reviewed by experts, including CS PhDs and top-tier competitive programming participants and problem setters. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on tasks with known optimal solutions, FrontierCS targets problems where the optimal solution is unknown, but the quality of a solution can be objectively evaluated. Models solve these tasks by implementing executable programs rather than outputting a direct answer. FrontierCS includes algorithmic problems, which are often NP-hard variants of competitive programming problems with objective partial scoring, and research problems with the same property. For each problem we provide an expert reference solution and an automatic evaluator. Combining open-ended design, measurable progress, and expert curation, FrontierCS provides a benchmark at the frontier of computer-science difficulty. Empirically, we find that frontier reasoning models still lag far behind human experts on both the algorithmic and research tracks, that increasing reasoning budgets alone does not close this gap, and that models often over-optimize for generating merely workable code instead of discovering high-quality algorithms and system designs.

TL;DR: PINN-based method learns time-varying cell interactions and treatment responses from sparse oncology data, predicting unobserved tumor-immune trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fixed-parameter models fail to capture evolving dynamics in biological systems, especially in oncology where data is sparse (few tumor volume time points). Need to model time-varying interactions between cells (bladder cancer tumors and immune cells) and their response to combination treatments with limited data.

Method: Physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach to predict possible subpopulation trajectories at unobserved time points. The method learns evolving interactions among biological organisms under external interventions.

Result: Demonstrated that the approach is consistent with biological explanations of subpopulation trajectories. Provides a framework for learning evolving interactions when external interventions are applied.

Conclusion: PINN-based framework successfully addresses the challenge of modeling time-varying cell interactions and treatment responses in sparse data scenarios, offering a biologically consistent approach for oncology applications.

Abstract: In a mathematical model of interacting biological organisms, where external interventions may alter behavior over time, traditional models that assume fixed parameters usually do not capture the evolving dynamics. In oncology, this is further exacerbated by the fact that experimental data are often sparse and sometimes are composed of a few time points of tumor volume. In this paper, we propose to learn time-varying interactions between cells, such as those of bladder cancer tumors and immune cells, and their response to a combination of anticancer treatments in a limited data scenario. We employ the physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach to predict possible subpopulation trajectories at time points where no observed data are available. We demonstrate that our approach is consistent with the biological explanation of subpopulation trajectories. Our method provides a framework for learning evolving interactions among biological organisms when external interventions are applied to their environment.

TL;DR: Proposed sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework with dynamic grid update strategies (GR-SBL and GE-SBL) for AFDM channel estimation in vehicular networks, plus distributed versions for complexity reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AFDM is promising for vehicle-to-everything communications but requires accurate channel estimation in doubly-dispersive channels, which is challenging. Existing methods may not achieve expected performance.

Method: Developed SBL framework with two off-grid channel estimation methods: GR-SBL uses localized grid refinement for high precision; GE-SBL uses first-order linear approximation for gradual grid evolution. Also created distributed versions (D-GR-SBL and D-GE-SBL) that decompose large models into smaller sub-models for parallel processing.

Result: Proposed estimators outperform existing schemes. GR-SBL achieves high-precision estimation with fine step sizes but high complexity. GE-SBL provides better performance-complexity trade-off. Distributed versions effectively reduce complexity while maintaining comparable performance.

Conclusion: The proposed SBL framework with dynamic grid update strategies enables accurate AFDM channel estimation in doubly-dispersive vehicular channels. Distributed implementations offer practical complexity reduction while preserving estimation performance.

Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) has been considered as a promising waveform to enable high-reliable connectivity in the internet of vehicles. However, accurate channel estimation is critical and challenging to achieve the expected performance of the AFDM systems in doubly-dispersive channels. In this paper, we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework for AFDM systems and develop a dynamic grid update strategy with two off-grid channel estimation methods, i.e., grid-refinement SBL (GR-SBL) and grid-evolution SBL (GE-SBL) estimators. Specifically, the GR-SBL employs a localized grid refinement method and dynamically updates grid for a high-precision estimation. The GE-SBL estimator approximates the off-grid components via first-order linear approximation and enables gradual grid evolution for estimation accuracy enhancement. Furthermore, we develop a distributed computing scheme to decompose the large-dimensional channel estimation model into multiple manageable small-dimensional sub-models for complexity reduction of GR-SBL and GE-SBL, denoted as distributed GR-SBL (D-GR-SBL) and distributed GE-SBL (D-GE-SBL) estimators, which also support parallel processing to reduce the computational latency. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimators outperform existing competitive schemes. The GR-SBL estimator achieves high-precision estimation with fine step sizes at the cost of high complexity, while the GE-SBL estimator provides a better trade-off between performance and complexity. The proposed D-GR-SBL and D-GE-SBL estimators effectively reduce complexity and maintain comparable performance to GR-SBL and GE-SBL estimators, respectively.

TL;DR: Stochastic analysis of error probability for large-field-size Random Linear Streaming Codes in multi-hop relay networks with i.i.d. packet erasures, extending from two-hop to arbitrary hop networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research focused on deterministic adversarial channels with restricted erasure patterns, aiming for optimal capacity-achieving codes. This paper addresses the gap by analyzing stochastic channels with i.i.d. packet erasures in multi-hop networks.

Method: 1) Characterize error events in two-hop networks using a novel framework that quantifies information flow through each node and extends "information debt" concept. 2) Derive average error probability expressions by analyzing expectation terms and constructing "band fashion" transition matrices with nested structure. 3) Generalize results to arbitrary number of hops.

Result: Developed analytical framework for error probability of RLSCs in multi-hop networks with stochastic erasures, verified through simulations that compare with existing streaming codes for adversarial channels.

Conclusion: The paper provides comprehensive stochastic analysis of RLSC performance in multi-hop relay networks, extending beyond deterministic adversarial models to practical stochastic channel conditions, with theoretical framework validated by simulations.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to explore the stochastic performance limit of large-field-size Random Linear Streaming Codes (RLSCs) in multi-hop relay networks. In our model, a source transmits a sequence of streaming messages to a destination through multiple relays subject to a delay constraint. Most previous research focused on deterministic adversarial channel which introduces only restricted types of erasure patterns, and aimed to design the optimal capacity-achieving codes. In this paper, we focus on stochastic channel where each hop is subject to i.i.d. packet erasures, and carry out stochastic analysis on the error probability of multi-hop RLSCs. Our contributions are three-folds. Firstly, the error event of large-field-size RLSCs is characterized in two-hop relay network with a novel framework, which features quantification of information flowing through each node in the network. Due to the erasures in different hops, some source symbols can be "detained" at the source or relay while others have arrived at the destination. By iteratively computing the number of detained symbols at each node, this framework extends the concept "information debt" from point-to-point network [Pinwen Su et al. 2022] into two-hop relay networks. Secondly, based on the error event, the expression of average error probability in two-hop network is derived by carefully analyzing the expectation terms. To handle the expectation over all possible erasure patterns along two hops of the network, the transition matrices of the detained symbols are novelly constructed in a "band fashion" with nested structure. Thirdly, the derived results in two-hop network are further generalized into relay networks with arbitrary number of hops. Furthermore, simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of our stochastic analysis, and compare with some existing streaming codes for the adversarial channels.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-functional antenna/surface system combining 6D movable antenna BS with rotatable IRS to enhance wireless communications using two-timescale optimization for reduced complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IRS and MA technologies have practical limitations in performance. The authors aim to leverage their complementary advantages by integrating them into a unified system to overcome individual constraints and enhance wireless communication capabilities.

Method: Proposes a system with 6DMA-equipped BS and rotatable IRS (R-IRS). Uses two-timescale transmission protocol: BS antenna configuration (position/rotation) and IRS rotation/reflection optimized with statistical CSI, while BS transmit beamforming uses instantaneous CSI. For multi-user case, combines WMMSE and SSCA techniques with a low-complexity algorithm.

Result: For single-user case: 6DMA should form sparse array for multi-beam transmission towards both IRS and user, coordinating direct and reflected channels efficiently. For multi-user: proposed algorithms effectively solve the non-convex optimization. Numerical results show significant performance gains by jointly exploiting spatial degrees of freedom.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-functional antenna/surface system with 6DMA-BS and R-IRS under TTS protocol achieves substantial performance improvements by effectively coordinating spatial resources and reducing computational complexity through statistical optimization.

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA) are promising technologies to enhance wireless communication by reconfiguring channels at the environment and transceiver sides. However, their performance is constrained by practical limitations. To address this, we propose a multi-functional antenna/surface system that leverages their complementary advantages. A rotatable IRS (R-IRS) is deployed to enhance downlink communications from a six-dimensional MA (6DMA)-equipped base station (BS) to multiple single-antenna users. To reduce the complexity of real-time channel estimation and beamforming, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average sum-rate using a two-timescale (TTS) transmission protocol. Specifically, the BS antenna configuration (including position and rotation) and IRS rotation and reflection are optimized based on statistical channel state information (S-CSI), while BS transmit beamforming is designed using instantaneous CSI (I-CSI) in the short timescale. We first consider a single-user case and show that the 6DMA at the BS should form a sparse array for multi-beam transmission towards both the IRS and the user, allowing efficient coordination of direct and reflected channels, while the IRS rotation achieves effective multi-path alignment. For the general multi-user case, the optimization problem is non-convex and challenging to solve. To tackle this, we propose an efficient algorithm combining weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) and stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) techniques. A low-complexity algorithm is also proposed to reduce computational complexity. Numerical results validate the proposed system, showing significant performance gains by jointly exploiting the spatial degrees of freedom of the 6DMA-BS and R-IRS under the TTS protocol.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: SEP is an iterative algorithm for sparse PCA that adapts to uneven spike energy distributions, achieving sample complexity that improves from k²log n for flat spikes toward k log n for concentrated spikes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most sparse PCA methods assume flat spike energy distribution, but real-world signals often have uneven energy profiles. Existing methods offer little guidance for such cases.

Method: Spectral Energy Pursuit (SEP) - an iterative scheme that repeatedly screens and reselects coordinates. Uses a structure function s(p) to quantify how spike energy accumulates over top p entries. Includes lightweight post-processing with single truncated power iteration.

Result: SEP succeeds with sample size of order max_{1≤p≤k} p·s²(p)·log n, which matches classical k²log n for flat spikes and improves toward k log n for concentrated profiles. Empirical simulations validate adaptation to profile structure without tuning.

Conclusion: SEP provides an effective adaptive approach for sparse PCA that handles uneven energy distributions, outperforming existing algorithms across various signal types (flat, power-law, exponential).

Abstract: We study sparse principal component analysis in the high-dimensional, sample-limited regime, aiming to recover a leading component supported on a few coordinates. Despite extensive progress, most methods and analyses are tailored to the flat-spike case, offering little guidance when spike energy is unevenly distributed across the support. Motivated by this, we propose Spectral Energy Pursuit (SEP), an effective iterative scheme that repeatedly screens and reselects coordinates, with a sample complexity that adapts to the energy profile. We develop our framework around a structure function \(s(p)\) that quantifies how spike energy accumulates over its top \(p\) entries. We establish that SEP succeeds with a sample size of order \(\max_{1\le p\le k} p\,s^2(p)\,\log n\), which matches the classical \(k^2\log n\) sample complexity for flat spikes and improves toward the \(k\log n\) regime as the profile becomes more concentrated. As a lightweight post-processing, a single truncated power iteration is proven to enable the final estimator to attain a uniform statistical error bound. Empirical simulations across flat, power-law, and exponential signals validate that SEP adapts to profile structure without tuning and outperforms existing algorithms.

TL;DR: Proposes a new symbol detection framework for ambient backscatter communications that addresses residual time synchronization errors, deriving exact/approximate BER expressions and a near-optimal detection threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous AmBC symbol detection assumed perfect time synchronization, which is unrealistic. Residual TS errors cause partial sample mismatch that degrades detection performance, creating a need for practical detection methods.

Method: Proposes a new AmBC symbol detection framework incorporating BT's current/adjacent symbols and channel coefficients. Uses energy detector as case study, derives BER expressions, finds near-optimal detection threshold under RTSE, and proposes parameter estimation method using BR's received signal samples.

Result: BER performance degrades significantly under RTSE with perfect TS-optimized thresholds. Derived closed-form expression for near-optimal detection threshold minimizes BER under RTSE. Proposed parameter estimation method works effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses practical RTSE issues in AmBC, providing analytical BER expressions and near-optimal detection thresholds with effective parameter estimation, verified by simulations.

Abstract: Ambient backscatter communications (AmBC), where a backscatter transmitter (BT) modulates and reflects ambient signals to a backscatter receiver (BR), have been deemed a low-power communication technology for the Internet of Things. Previous work on symbol detection in AmBC assumed perfect time synchronization (TS), which is unrealistic in practice. The residual TS errors (RTSE) cause \emph{partial sample mismatch}, degrading symbol detection performance. To address this, we propose a new AmBC symbol detection framework that incorporates the BT's current and adjacent symbols, as well as channel coefficients. Using energy detector (ED) as a case study, we derive both exact and approximate bit error rate (BER) expressions. Our results show that the ED's BER performance degrades significantly under RTSE, with the symbol detection threshold optimized under the assumption of perfect TS. We then derive a closed-form expression for a near-optimal symbol detection threshold that minimizes BER under RTSE. To estimate the required parameters for the detection threshold, we propose a novel method exploiting the attributes of the BR's received signal samples. The analytical results are verified by simulation results.

TL;DR: Proposes EM-AMP framework for channel estimation in fluid antenna systems, addressing limitations of existing methods with improved precision, convergence, and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing channel estimation methods for fluid antenna systems have significant flaws: greedy algorithms depend heavily on signal assumptions, while model-free methods suffer from prohibitive computational complexity. There's a need for flexible, feasible, low-complexity solutions to support massive connectivity in FAS networks.

Method: Proposes approximate message passing (AMP) integrated with adaptive expectation maximization (EM) framework. Introduces two variants leveraging geographical and angular features in FAS networks. The EM-AMP enables efficient large matrix computations with adaptive learning without requiring prior knowledge of model parameters.

Result: The proposed algorithms demonstrate improved estimation precision, fast convergence, and low computational complexity in large activity regions. Analytical insights explain performance limitations of greedy methods and highlight importance of angular information.

Conclusion: The EM-AMP framework provides a robust, balanced solution for FAS channel estimation, addressing key limitations of existing methods while supporting massive connectivity requirements through flexible, feasible, and low-complexity design.

Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) refers to a family of reconfigurable antenna technologies that provide substantial spatial gains within a compact, predefined small space, thereby offering extensive degrees of freedom in the physical layer for future communication networks. The acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is critical, as it determines the placement of ports/antennas, which directly impacts FAS-based optimization. Although various channel estimation methods have been developed, significant flaws persist. For instance, the performance of greedy-based algorithms is heavily influenced by signal assumptions, and current model-free methods are infeasible due to prohibitively high computational complexity issue. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a well-balanced solution that exhibits flexibility, feasibility, and low complexity to support massive connectivity in FAS. In this work, we propose methods based on approximate message passing (AMP) integrated with adaptive expectation maximization (EM). The EM-AMP framework uniquely enables efficient large matrix computations with adaptive learning capabilities, independent of prior knowledge of the model or parameters within potential distributions, making it a robust candidate for FAS networks. We introduce two variants of the EM-AMP framework that leverage geographical and angular features in a FAS network. These proposed algorithms demonstrate improved estimation precision, fast convergence, and low computational complexity in large activity regions. Additionally, we analytically elucidate the reasons behind the inherent performance floor of greedy-based methods and highlight the critical role of angular information in algorithm design. Extensive numerical results validate the promising efficacy of the proposed algorithm designs and the derived analytical findings.

*Phillip Stephan,Florian Euchner,Stephan ten Brink*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper extends channel charting to 3D indoor localization scenarios, proposing augmented channel charting for 3D distributed datapoints and multistory channel charting for multi-floor buildings with floor classification and expert networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior channel charting work focused on 2D scenarios, but real-world environments are inherently 3D. The paper addresses the need to extend channel charting to practical 3D indoor localization scenarios like factory halls and multi-story buildings.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Augmented channel charting combining classical localization and channel charting for 3D distributed datapoints. 2) Multistory channel charting with floor classification via clustering followed by expert neural networks for each floor. Also proposes novel sparse feature engineering from beamspace CSI.

Result: The methods are evaluated using simulated but realistic ray tracing-based datasets for two scenarios: a factory hall with 3D spatial distribution and a multistory building with 2D distribution per floor. The approaches enhance channel charting performance in 3D indoor environments.

Conclusion: Channel charting can be effectively extended to 3D indoor localization scenarios through specialized approaches like augmented channel charting for continuous 3D spaces and multistory channel charting for floor-separated environments, with improved feature engineering from beamspace CSI.

Abstract: Channel charting creates a low-dimensional representation of the radio environment in a self-supervised manner using manifold learning. Preserving relative spatial distances in the latent space, channel charting is well suited to support user localization. While prior work on channel charting has mainly focused on two-dimensional scenarios, real-world environments are inherently three-dimensional. In this work, we investigate two distinct three-dimensional indoor localization scenarios using simulated, but realistic ray tracing-based datasets: a factory hall with a three-dimensional spatial distribution of datapoints, and a multistory building where each floor exhibits a two-dimensional datapoint distribution. For the first scenario, we apply the concept of augmented channel charting, which combines classical localization and channel charting, to a three-dimensional setting. For the second scenario, we introduce multistory channel charting, a two-stage approach consisting of floor classification via clustering followed by the training of a dedicated expert neural network for channel charting on each individual floor, thereby enhancing the channel charting performance. In addition, we propose a novel feature engineering method designed to extract sparse features from the beamspace channel state information that are suitable for localization.

### [183] [Variational Robust Kalman Filters: A Unified Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15419)
*Shilei Li,Dawei Shi,Hao Yu,Ling Shi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes a unified variational robust Kalman filter that combines robustness and adaptivity using Student's t-distribution and variational inference, with fixed-point iteration for efficient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Kalman filters struggle with complex noise scenarios involving outliers and time-varying noise, as robust filters (which inflate noise covariances) and adaptive filters (which update prior beliefs) are inherently incompatible.

Method: Develops a unified variational robust Kalman filter based on Student's t-distribution induced loss function and variational inference, solved through computationally efficient fixed-point iteration. Uses switching rules to merge robustness and adaptivity.

Result: The proposed filter can recover conventional KF, robust KF, and adaptive KF by adjusting parameters, and can suppress both imperfect process and measurement noise. Demonstrates superior performance in complex noise environments through simulations.

Conclusion: Robustness is a prerequisite for adaptivity, enabling the unification of these competing objectives. The proposed framework effectively handles complex noise scenarios including outliers and time-varying noise.

Abstract: Robustness and adaptivity are two competing objectives in Kalman filters (KF). Robustness involves temporarily inflating prior estimates of noise covariances, while adaptivity updates prior beliefs using real-time information. In practical applications, both process and measurement noise can be influenced by outliers, be time-varying, or both. Existing works may not effectively address the above complex noise scenarios, as there is an intrinsic incompatibility between robust filters and adaptive filters. In this work, we propose a unified variational robust Kalman filter, built on a Student's t-distribution induced loss function and variational inference, and solved through fixed-point iteration in a computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate that robustness can be understood as a prerequisite for adaptivity, making it possible to merge the above two competing goals into a single framework through switching rules. Additionally, our proposed filter can recover conventional KF, robust KF, and adaptive KF by adjusting parameters, and can suppress both the imperfect process and measurement noise, enabling it to perform superiorly in complex noise environments. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliability and resource efficiency challenges in high-mobility scenarios where adversarial devices create malicious high-power interference that disrupts communication systems.

Method: Derives closed-form interference expressions using stationary phase principle and Affine Fourier transform convolution theorem; designs parameter optimization algorithm for maximizing packet throughput; develops correlation-based DAFT domain detector (CDD) with linear complexity using autocorrelation of spreading sequences and cyclic-shift properties.

Result: Numerical results validate accuracy of derived closed-form expressions; proposed system achieves high packet throughput under interference in high-mobility scenarios; CDD detector achieves full diversity gain without matrix inversion.

Conclusion: Anti-interference AFDM system effectively ensures reliability and resource efficiency against malicious interference in high-mobility environments through analytical modeling, parameter optimization, and efficient detection algorithms.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anti-interference affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) system to ensure reliability and resource efficiency under malicious high-power interference originating from adversarial devices in high-mobility scenarios. Closed-form expressions of interferences in the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) domain are derived by utilizing the stationary phase principle and the Affine Fourier transform convolution theorem, which indicates that interference impacts can be classified into stationary and non-stationary categories. On this basis, we reveal the analytical relationship between packet throughput and the paramerters of spread spectrum and error correction coding in our proposed anti-interference system, which enables the design of a parameter optimization algorithm that maximizes packet throughput. For reception, by jointly utilizing the autocorrelation function of spreading sequence and the cyclic-shift property of AFDM input-output relation, we design a linear-complexity correlation-based DAFT domain detector (CDD) capable of achieving full diversity gain, which performs correlation-based equalization to avoid matrix inversion. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions and verify that the proposed anti-interference AFDM system could achieve high packet throughput under interference in high-mobility scenarios.

Conclusion: The predictive-foundation-model-based framework enables accurate, low-overhead, and generalizable CSI acquisition, addressing limitations of existing solutions in modern wireless systems.

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition is essential for modern wireless systems, which becomes increasingly difficult under large antenna arrays, strict pilot overhead constraints, and diverse deployment environments. Existing artificial intelligence-based solutions often lack robustness and fail to generalize across scenarios. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a predictive-foundation-model-based channel estimation framework that enables accurate, low-overhead, and generalizable CSI acquisition. The proposed framework employs a predictive foundation model trained on large-scale cross-domain CSI data to extract universal channel representations and provide predictive priors with strong cross-scenario transferability. A pilot processing network based on a vision transformer architecture is further designed to capture spatial, temporal, and frequency correlations from pilot observations. An efficient fusion mechanism integrates predictive priors with real-time measurements, enabling reliable CSI reconstruction even under sparse or noisy conditions. Extensive evaluations across diverse configurations demonstrate that the proposed estimator significantly outperforms both classical and data-driven baselines in accuracy, robustness, and generalization capability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models show impressive reasoning-like behavior but remain brittle on symbolic manipulation tasks. The paper aims to develop a unified perspective to understand these phenomena and improve logical reliability.

Method: Interpret self-attention and residual streams as implementing approximate VSA: queries/keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition. Propose VSA-inspired architectural biases including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers.

Conclusion: Viewing attention as soft vector-symbolic computation offers a principled route toward more interpretable and logically reliable reasoning systems, with outlined theoretical and architectural open problems for future work.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models display impressive reasoning-like behavior, yet remain brittle on tasks that require stable symbolic manipulation. This paper develops a unified perspective on these phenomena by interpreting self-attention and residual streams as implementing an approximate Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). In this view, queries and keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition of many bound structures. We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition. Finally, we outline metrics for measuring "VSA-likeness" and logical compositionality, and pose theoretical and architectural open problems. Overall, the paper argues that viewing attention as soft vector-symbolic computation offers a principled route toward more interpretable and logically reliable reasoning systems.

TL;DR: The paper addresses KGQA under incomplete knowledge graphs, proposing a benchmark construction methodology and an Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent) that outperforms baselines in both complete and incomplete settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most KGQA benchmarks assume complete knowledge graphs with direct supporting triples, overlooking the reality of incomplete KGs where facts are missing and answers require inference from existing facts.

Method: 1) Methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness by removing direct supporting triples while preserving alternative reasoning paths. 2) Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent) that constructs interactive environment from KG, formalizes KGQA as agent-environment interaction, operates over graph reasoning tools, and maintains memory of supporting evidence.

Result: Existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting limited reasoning ability. GR-Agent outperforms non-training baselines and performs comparably to training-based methods in both complete and incomplete settings.

Conclusion: The paper bridges the gap in KGQA evaluation by addressing KG incompleteness, demonstrating the need for better reasoning methods and proposing GR-Agent as an effective solution that maintains strong performance even when direct supporting facts are missing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong results on knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), but most benchmarks assume complete knowledge graphs (KGs) where direct supporting triples exist. This reduces evaluation to shallow retrieval and overlooks the reality of incomplete KGs, where many facts are missing and answers must be inferred from existing facts. We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent). It first constructs an interactive environment from the KG, and then formalizes KGQA as agent environment interaction within this environment. GR-Agent operates over an action space comprising graph reasoning tools and maintains a memory of potential supporting reasoning evidence, including relevant relations and reasoning paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GR-Agent outperforms non-training baselines and performs comparably to training-based methods under both complete and incomplete settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs have low success rates in generating correct and intent-aligned Infrastructure as Code (IaC), particularly for Terraform, necessitating better methods to improve LLM-based IaC generation.

Method: Enhanced IaC-Eval benchmark with cloud emulation and automated error analysis; developed error taxonomy for LLM-assisted IaC generation; implemented knowledge injection techniques from Naive RAG to sophisticated Graph RAG with semantic enrichment and inter-resource dependency modeling.

Result: Baseline LLM performance was poor (27.1% overall success). Injecting structured configuration knowledge increased technical validation success to 75.3% and overall success to 62.6%, but intent alignment plateaued.

Conclusion: While knowledge injection significantly improves technical correctness of LLM-generated IaC, it reveals a "Correctness-Congruence Gap" where LLMs become proficient "coders" but remain limited "architects" in fulfilling nuanced user intent.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) currently exhibit low success rates in generating correct and intent-aligned Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This research investigated methods to improve LLM-based IaC generation, specifically for Terraform, by systematically injecting structured configuration knowledge. To facilitate this, an existing IaC-Eval benchmark was significantly enhanced with cloud emulation and automated error analysis. Additionally, a novel error taxonomy for LLM-assisted IaC code generation was developed. A series of knowledge injection techniques was implemented and evaluated, progressing from Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to more sophisticated Graph RAG approaches. These included semantic enrichment of graph components and modeling inter-resource dependencies. Experimental results demonstrated that while baseline LLM performance was poor (27.1% overall success), injecting structured configuration knowledge increased technical validation success to 75.3% and overall success to 62.6%. Despite these gains in technical correctness, intent alignment plateaued, revealing a "Correctness-Congruence Gap" where LLMs can become proficient "coders" but remain limited "architects" in fulfilling nuanced user intent.

*Xidan Song,Weiqi Wang,Ruifeng Cao,Qingya Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs evaluated on chess reasoning show high accuracy but fail geometric stability tests, revealing they rely on pattern matching rather than true spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard accuracy metrics for LLMs in chess evaluation don't distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and superficial memorization of canonical board states.

Method: Proposed Geometric Stability Framework testing model consistency under invariant transformations (board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, format conversion) on 6 state-of-the-art LLMs using ~3,000 positions.

Result: Revealed Accuracy-Stability Paradox: models like GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy but show catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation (600%+ error increase in rotation). Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo show superior dual robustness.

Conclusion: Geometric stability provides an essential orthogonal metric for AI evaluation, helping disentangle reasoning capabilities from data contamination and overfitting in large models.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning domains typically relies on performance alignment with ground-truth oracles. In the domain of chess, this standard manifests as accuracy benchmarks against strong engines like Stockfish. However, high scalar accuracy does not necessarily imply robust conceptual understanding. This paper argues that standard accuracy metrics fail to distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and the superficial memorization of canonical board states. To address this gap, we propose a Geometric Stability Framework, a novel evaluation methodology that rigorously tests model consistency under invariant transformations-including board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, and format conversion. We applied this framework to a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Kimi K2 Turbo, utilizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 positions. Our results reveal a significant Accuracy-Stability Paradox. While models such as GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy on standard positions, they exhibit catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation, specifically in rotation tasks where error rates surge by over 600%. This disparity suggests a reliance on pattern matching over abstract spatial logic. Conversely, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo demonstrate superior dual robustness, maintaining high consistency across all transformation axes. Furthermore, we analyze the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, identifying Gemini 2.5 Flash as the leader in illegal state rejection (96.0%). We conclude that geometric stability provides an orthogonal and essential metric for AI evaluation, offering a necessary proxy for disentangling reasoning capabilities from data contamination and overfitting in large-scale models.

Conclusion: LADY addresses the computational limitations of Transformer-based autonomous driving models by introducing a fully linear attention architecture that maintains performance while enabling efficient deployment on edge devices through constant computational/memory complexity regardless of temporal history length.

Abstract: End-to-end paradigms have demonstrated great potential for autonomous driving. Additionally, most existing methods are built upon Transformer architectures. However, transformers incur a quadratic attention cost, limiting their ability to model long spatial and temporal sequences-particularly on resource-constrained edge platforms. As autonomous driving inherently demands efficient temporal modeling, this challenge severely limits their deployment and real-time performance. Recently, linear attention mechanisms have gained increasing attention due to their superior spatiotemporal complexity. However, existing linear attention architectures are limited to self-attention, lacking support for cross-modal and cross-temporal interactions-both crucial for autonomous driving. In this work, we propose LADY, the first fully linear attention-based generative model for end-to-end autonomous driving. LADY enables fusion of long-range temporal context at inference with constant computational and memory costs, regardless of the history length of camera and LiDAR features. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight linear cross-attention mechanism that enables effective cross-modal information exchange. Experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that LADY achieves state-of-the-art performance with constant-time and memory complexity, offering improved planning performance and significantly reduced computational cost. Additionally, the model has been deployed and validated on edge devices, demonstrating its practicality in resource-limited scenarios.

Result: CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods with at least 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks.

Conclusion: The cognitive-inspired elastic reasoning framework effectively balances reasoning efficiency and accuracy by dynamically adapting to query difficulty, offering a promising approach for LLM reasoning optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various language tasks. However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods, achieving at least a 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks.

### [194] [A Clustering-Based Variable Ordering Framework for Relaxed Decision Diagrams for Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15198)
*Mohsen Nafar,Michael Römer,Lin Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Novel clustering-based framework for variable ordering in Relaxed Decision Diagrams reduces computational overhead of dynamic ordering heuristics by partitioning variables into clusters, with two strategies tested on Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic variable ordering heuristics for Relaxed Decision Diagrams effectively tighten dual bounds but incur significant computational overhead when applied globally across all variables. There's a need to mitigate this trade-off between bound quality and computational cost.

Method: Introduces clustering-based framework that partitions variables into clusters before applying ordering heuristics. Two strategies: 1) Cluster-to-Cluster processes clusters sequentially using aggregate criteria, 2) Pick-and-Sort iteratively selects and sorts representative variables from each cluster. Theoretical analysis on DD growth for MWISP informs cluster number policies.

Result: The proposed methodology consistently reduces computational costs compared to standard dynamic variable ordering baseline across benchmark instances of the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem.

Conclusion: Clustering-based variable ordering framework effectively balances bound quality and computational efficiency for Relaxed Decision Diagrams, offering a practical solution to the overhead problem of dynamic ordering heuristics.

Abstract: Efficient exact algorithms for Discrete Optimization (DO) rely heavily on strong primal and dual bounds. Relaxed Decision Diagrams (DDs) provide a versatile mechanism for deriving such dual bounds by compactly over-approximating the solution space through node merging. However, the quality of these relaxed diagrams, i.e. the tightness of the resulting dual bounds, depends critically on the variable ordering and the merging decisions executed during compilation. While dynamic variable ordering heuristics effectively tighten bounds, they often incur computational overhead when evaluated globally across the entire variable set. To mitigate this trade-off, this work introduces a novel clustering-based framework for variable ordering. Instead of applying dynamic ordering heuristics to the full set of unfixed variables, we first partition variables into clusters. We then leverage this structural decomposition to guide the ordering process, significantly reducing the heuristic's search space. Within this framework, we investigate two distinct strategies: Cluster-to-Cluster, which processes clusters sequentially using problem-specific aggregate criteria (such as cumulative vertex weights in the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem (MWISP)), and Pick-and-Sort, which iteratively selects and sorts representative variables from each cluster to balance local diversity with heuristic guidance. Later on, developing some theoretical results on the growth of the size of DDs for MWISP we propose two different policies for setting the number of clusters within the proposed framework. We embed these strategies into a DD-based branch-and-bound algorithm and evaluate them on the MWISP. Across benchmark instances, the proposed methodology consistently reduces computational costs compared to standard dynamic variable ordering baseline.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CangLing-KnowFlow is a unified intelligent agent framework for Earth observation that integrates expert knowledge, dynamic workflow adjustment, and evolutionary memory to automate complex remote sensing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated systems for remote sensing are task-specific and lack a unified framework to manage diverse end-to-end workflows across different Earth observation applications, creating a need for a more comprehensive solution.

Method: The framework combines three key components: 1) Procedural Knowledge Base (PKB) with 1,008 expert-validated workflow cases across 162 RS tasks, 2) Dynamic Workflow Adjustment for autonomous diagnosis and recovery during runtime failures, and 3) Evolutionary Memory Module that continuously learns from execution events to enhance performance.

Result: Evaluated on KnowFlow-Bench (324 workflows from real-world applications) with 13 LLM backbones, CangLing-KnowFlow surpassed the Reflexion baseline by at least 4% in Task Success Rate across all complex tasks.

Conclusion: CangLing-KnowFlow demonstrates significant potential as a robust, efficient, and scalable automated solution for complex Earth observation challenges by integrating expert knowledge into adaptive and verifiable procedures.

Abstract: The automated and intelligent processing of massive remote sensing (RS) datasets is critical in Earth observation (EO). Existing automated systems are normally task-specific, lacking a unified framework to manage diverse, end-to-end workflows--from data preprocessing to advanced interpretation--across diverse RS applications. To address this gap, this paper introduces CangLing-KnowFlow, a unified intelligent agent framework that integrates a Procedural Knowledge Base (PKB), Dynamic Workflow Adjustment, and an Evolutionary Memory Module. The PKB, comprising 1,008 expert-validated workflow cases across 162 practical RS tasks, guides planning and substantially reduces hallucinations common in general-purpose agents. During runtime failures, the Dynamic Workflow Adjustment autonomously diagnoses and replans recovery strategies, while the Evolutionary Memory Module continuously learns from these events, iteratively enhancing the agent's knowledge and performance. This synergy enables CangLing-KnowFlow to adapt, learn, and operate reliably across diverse, complex tasks. We evaluated CangLing-KnowFlow on the KnowFlow-Bench, a novel benchmark of 324 workflows inspired by real-world applications, testing its performance across 13 top Large Language Model (LLM) backbones, from open-source to commercial. Across all complex tasks, CangLing-KnowFlow surpassed the Reflexion baseline by at least 4% in Task Success Rate. As the first most comprehensive validation along this emerging field, this research demonstrates the great potential of CangLing-KnowFlow as a robust, efficient, and scalable automated solution for complex EO challenges by leveraging expert knowledge (Knowledge) into adaptive and verifiable procedures (Flow).

TL;DR: GCRL enhances RL-based controller synthesis by using GNNs to encode exploration history into graphs, improving learning efficiency and generalization across most benchmark domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based controller synthesis methods rely on limited current features, lacking broader contextual understanding of LTS exploration history, which limits efficiency and generalization.

Method: GCRL integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to encode the history of LTS exploration into a graph structure, capturing non-current-based context for better decision-making in controller synthesis.

Result: GCRL demonstrated superior learning efficiency and generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods in 4 out of 5 benchmark domains, struggling only in one domain with high symmetry and strictly local interactions.

Conclusion: Graph-based encoding of exploration history significantly improves RL-based controller synthesis, though challenges remain for domains with high symmetry and strictly local interactions.

Abstract: Controller synthesis is a formal method approach for automatically generating Labeled Transition System (LTS) controllers that satisfy specified properties. The efficiency of the synthesis process, however, is critically dependent on exploration policies. These policies often rely on fixed rules or strategies learned through reinforcement learning (RL) that consider only a limited set of current features. To address this limitation, this paper introduces GCRL, an approach that enhances RL-based methods by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GCRL encodes the history of LTS exploration into a graph structure, allowing it to capture a broader, non-current-based context. In a comparative experiment against state-of-the-art methods, GCRL exhibited superior learning efficiency and generalization across four out of five benchmark domains, except one particular domain characterized by high symmetry and strictly local interactions.

TL;DR: Analysis of multimodal scientific reasoning in LLMs using Korean CSAT Earth Science questions reveals critical cognitive gaps: perception-cognition disconnect, calculation-conceptualization discrepancy, and process hallucination, providing insights for designing AI-resistant assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing student use of AI for assignments raising academic integrity concerns, this study aims to understand LLMs' multimodal scientific reasoning capabilities and limitations to help educators design assessments that can distinguish genuine student work from AI-generated responses.

Method: Used Earth Science I section of 2025 Korean CSAT to evaluate GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro under three experimental conditions: full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input, combining quantitative performance analysis with qualitative error pattern identification.

Result: Unstructured inputs caused significant performance degradation due to segmentation and OCR failures. Even under optimized conditions, models showed fundamental reasoning flaws including: 1) Perception-Cognition Gap (recognizing visual data but failing to interpret symbolic meanings), 2) Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy (performing calculations correctly while failing to apply underlying scientific concepts), and 3) Process Hallucination (skipping visual verification in favor of unfounded background knowledge).

Conclusion: The study identifies specific cognitive vulnerabilities in LLMs that can be exploited to design "AI-resistant questions" targeting perception-cognition gaps and other weaknesses, enabling educators to create assessments that distinguish genuine student competency from AI-generated responses and ensure assessment fairness.

Abstract: The rapid development of Generative AI is bringing innovative changes to education and assessment. As the prevalence of students utilizing AI for assignments increases, concerns regarding academic integrity and the validity of assessments are growing. This study utilizes the Earth Science I section of the 2025 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to deeply analyze the multimodal scientific reasoning capabilities and cognitive limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures. Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that "Perception Errors" were dominant, highlighting a "Perception-Cognition Gap" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data. Furthermore, models demonstrated a "Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy," successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and "Process Hallucination," where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge. Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing "AI-resistant questions" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities. By exploiting AI's weaknesses, such as the gap between perception and cognition, educators can distinguish genuine student competency from AI-generated responses, thereby ensuring assessment fairness.

TL;DR: SCOPE introduces a self-evolving prompt optimization framework that automatically improves LLM agent performance by managing dynamic contexts through online optimization of prompts based on execution traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents face a critical bottleneck in managing massive, dynamic contexts - their static prompts lack mechanisms for effective context management, leading to recurring Corrective and Enhancement failures.

Method: SCOPE frames context management as an online optimization problem, using a Dual-Stream mechanism that balances tactical specificity (resolving immediate errors) with strategic generality (evolving long-term principles), plus Perspective-Driven Exploration to maximize strategy coverage.

Result: Experiments on the HLE benchmark show SCOPE improves task success rates from 14.23% to 38.64% without human intervention.

Conclusion: SCOPE effectively addresses the context management gap in LLM agents through automated prompt evolution, significantly improving performance in dynamic environments without requiring human intervention.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in environments that generate massive, dynamic contexts. However, a critical bottleneck remains: while agents have access to this context, their static prompts lack the mechanisms to manage it effectively, leading to recurring Corrective and Enhancement failures. To address this capability gap, we introduce \textbf{SCOPE} (Self-evolving Context Optimization via Prompt Evolution). SCOPE frames context management as an \textit{online optimization} problem, synthesizing guidelines from execution traces to automatically evolve the agent's prompt. We propose a Dual-Stream mechanism that balances tactical specificity (resolving immediate errors) with strategic generality (evolving long-term principles). Furthermore, we introduce Perspective-Driven Exploration to maximize strategy coverage, increasing the likelihood that the agent has the correct strategy for any given task. Experiments on the HLE benchmark show that SCOPE improves task success rates from 14.23\% to 38.64\% without human intervention.

Method: Incorporates qualitative spatial relations (like "left of," "near," "between") into LLM training or prompting to enhance spatial reasoning for pedestrian wayfinding instructions.

Result: LLMs with qualitative spatial relations produce more accurate, human-like route instructions that better match how pedestrians naturally navigate and communicate directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early game decisions (bidding, game selection, initial card selection) are critical in multi-player card games but current computational limits force reliance on statistical information from human expert games, which is limited.

Method: General bootstrapping outer-learning framework that expands human game databases with millions of AI self-play games, using perfect feature hash functions to address compacted tables, creating a self-improving engine that continuously improves during self-learning.

Result: Case study in Skat demonstrates the automated approach can support various decisions in the game, showing improved prediction accuracy through database expansion with AI-generated games.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances decision-making in card games by combining human expertise with AI self-play, creating a continuously improving system that addresses computational limitations of pure human game analysis.

Abstract: In multi-player card games such as Skat or Bridge, the early stages of the game, such as bidding, game selection, and initial card selection, are often more critical to the success of the play than refined middle- and end-game play. At the current limits of computation, such early decision-making resorts to using statistical information derived from a large corpus of human expert games. In this paper, we derive and evaluate a general bootstrapping outer-learning framework that improves prediction accuracy by expanding the database of human games with millions of self-playing AI games to generate and merge statistics. We implement perfect feature hash functions to address compacted tables, producing a self-improving card game engine, where newly inferred knowledge is continuously improved during self-learning. The case study in Skat shows that the automated approach can be used to support various decisions in the game.

Method: Combines Answer Set Programming (ASP) and Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) with three-valued logic for interpreting ambiguous user intents and decision trees for transparent human input integration.

Result: Proposes an integrated framework that optimizes schedules while supporting transparent human inputs, providing robust structure for explainable, adaptive UAM scheduling.

Conclusion: The system enables robust, explainable, and adaptive scheduling for UAM vertiports by combining formal optimization with human-in-the-loop decision making.

Abstract: Due to the restricted resources, efficient scheduling in vertiports has received much more attention in the field of Urban Air Mobility (UAM). For the scheduling problem, we utilize a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), which is often formulated in a resource-restricted project scheduling problem (RCPSP). In this paper, we show our approach to handle both dynamic operation requirements and vague rescheduling requests from humans. Particularly, we utilize a three-valued logic for interpreting ambiguous user intents and a decision tree, proposing a newly integrated system that combines Answer Set Programming (ASP) and MILP. This integrated framework optimizes schedules and supports human inputs transparently. With this system, we provide a robust structure for explainable, adaptive UAM scheduling.

TL;DR: A new benchmark evaluates LLMs on scientific discovery tasks beyond decontextualized knowledge, revealing performance gaps and limitations in current models for real scientific research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current science benchmarks for LLMs focus on decontextualized knowledge but overlook the iterative reasoning, hypothesis generation, and observation interpretation essential for scientific discovery. There's a need to evaluate LLMs on tasks that better reflect real scientific research processes.

Method: Developed a scenario-grounded benchmark across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics where domain experts define genuine research projects decomposed into modular scenarios. Uses a two-phase Scientific Discovery Evaluation (SDE) framework: (1) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items, and (2) project-level performance requiring hypothesis generation, experimental design, and result interpretation.

Result: Reveals consistent performance gap compared to general science benchmarks, diminishing returns from model scaling and reasoning, systematic weaknesses across top-tier models, and large performance variation across research scenarios. Shows LLMs demonstrate promise in scientific discovery projects even when constituent scenario scores are low.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are distant from general scientific "superintelligence," but show promise in scientific discovery. The SDE framework provides a reproducible benchmark for discovery-relevant evaluation and charts practical paths for advancing LLMs toward scientific discovery applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet prevailing science benchmarks probe decontextualized knowledge and overlook the iterative reasoning, hypothesis generation, and observation interpretation that drive scientific discovery. We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific "superintelligence". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery. This SDE framework offers a reproducible benchmark for discovery-relevant evaluation of LLMs and charts practical paths to advance their development toward scientific discovery.

*Daniel A. Herrmann,Abinav Chari,Isabelle Qian,Sree Sharvesh,B. A. Levinstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A decision-theoretic framework for determining when to delegate decisions to AI systems, showing that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant value misalignment if the AI has superior accuracy or expanded reach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AI value alignment techniques exist, there's limited guidance on determining when imperfect alignment is sufficient to justify delegation under uncertainty. The paper aims to provide principled methods for deciding when AI is "aligned enough" for specific contexts.

Method: Introduces a formal decision-theoretic framework that balances three factors: value (mis)alignment, epistemic accuracy, and reach (available acts). Develops a novel scoring framework to quantify ex ante delegation decisions and distinguishes between universal vs. context-specific delegation scenarios.

Result: Reveals a sharp distinction: universal delegation requires near-perfect alignment and total epistemic trust (rare in practice), while context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment if the AI's superior accuracy or expanded reach provides access to better decision problems.

Conclusion: Provides a principled method for determining when AI is aligned enough for specific contexts, shifting focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty. Rational delegation depends on balancing alignment, accuracy, and reach.

Abstract: When should we delegate decisions to AI systems? While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human critical thinking intertwines reasoning and evaluation, but existing LLMs decouple them - either generating reasoning without self-checking or relying on external verifiers, which lacks immediate feedback or increases system complexity.

Method: Stepwise Think-Critique (STC) framework that interleaves reasoning and self-critique at each step within a single model, trained with hybrid reinforcement learning combining reasoning rewards and critique-consistency rewards.

Result: Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show STC demonstrates strong critic-thinking capabilities and produces more interpretable reasoning traces.

Conclusion: STC represents a step toward LLMs with built-in critical thinking by unifying reasoning and self-evaluation in a single framework.

Abstract: Human beings solve complex problems through critical thinking, where reasoning and evaluation are intertwined to converge toward correct solutions. However, most existing large language models (LLMs) decouple reasoning from verification: they either generate reasoning without explicit self-checking or rely on external verifiers to detect errors post hoc. The former lacks immediate feedback, while the latter increases system complexity and hinders synchronized learning. Motivated by human critical thinking, we propose Stepwise Think-Critique (STC), a unified framework that interleaves reasoning and self-critique at each step within a single model. STC is trained with a hybrid reinforcement learning objective combining reasoning rewards and critique-consistency rewards to jointly optimize reasoning quality and self-evaluation. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that STC demonstrates strong critic-thinking capabilities and produces more interpretable reasoning traces, representing a step toward LLMs with built-in critical thinking.

### [206] [Explaining the Reasoning of Large Language Models Using Attribution Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15663)
*Chase Walker,Rickard Ewetz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAGE framework improves LLM explanation by creating attribution graphs that capture inter-generational influences between tokens, not just prompt-to-output relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current context attribution methods for LLMs are incomplete because they only relate generated tokens directly to the prompt, ignoring how earlier generations influence later ones, which limits explanation quality and faithfulness.

Method: Introduces Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework that builds an attribution graph - a directed graph quantifying how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations, preserving causality and row stochasticity.

Result: CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, achieving average gains of up to 40% compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: CAGE provides more complete and faithful explanations of LLM behavior by capturing inter-generational influences through attribution graphs, addressing limitations of current context attribution methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet their reasoning remains opaque, raising safety and trust concerns. Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph. Across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness, achieving average gains of up to 40%.

The core innovation lies in leveraging deep learning and multi-agent collaboration to enable multidimensional simulations of art historical developments and conceptual innovation patterns. The framework explores a shift from traditional unidirectional critique toward an intelligent, interactive mode of reflexive practice. We are currently applying this method in experimental studies on contemporary art concepts.

*Mahmut S. Gokmen,Mitchell A. Klusty,Peter T. Nelson,Allison M. Neltner,Sen-Ching Samson Cheung,Thomas M. Pearce,David A Gutman,Brittany N. Dugger,Devavrat S. Bisht,Margaret E. Flanagan,V. K. Cody Bumgardner*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MAD-NP is a self-supervised foundation model that learns resolution-invariant representations from whole-slide images by linking low-magnification context with high-magnification detail through cross-scale distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised methods treat different magnification levels in whole-slide images as independent views, preventing models from learning representations that remain stable when resolution changes - a key requirement for practical neuropathology workflows.

Method: Magnification-Aware Distillation (MAD) links low-magnification context with spatially aligned high-magnification detail through self-supervised learning, enabling the model to learn how coarse tissue structure relates to fine cellular patterns without annotations.

Result: A linear classifier trained only on 10x embeddings maintains 96.7% of its performance when applied to unseen 40x tiles, demonstrating strong resolution-invariant representation learning. Segmentation outputs remain consistent across magnifications with preserved anatomical boundaries.

Conclusion: MAD-NP enables scalable, magnification-robust WSI analysis using a unified embedding space, highlighting the feasibility of practical neuropathology workflows with consistent performance across resolution changes.

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) contain tissue information distributed across multiple magnification levels, yet most self-supervised methods treat these scales as independent views. This separation prevents models from learning representations that remain stable when resolution changes, a key requirement for practical neuropathology workflows. This study introduces Magnification-Aware Distillation (MAD), a self-supervised strategy that links low-magnification context with spatially aligned high-magnification detail, enabling the model to learn how coarse tissue structure relates to fine cellular patterns. The resulting foundation model, MAD-NP, is trained entirely through this cross-scale correspondence without annotations. A linear classifier trained only on 10x embeddings maintains 96.7% of its performance when applied to unseen 40x tiles, demonstrating strong resolution-invariant representation learning. Segmentation outputs remain consistent across magnifications, preserving anatomical boundaries and minimizing noise. These results highlight the feasibility of scalable, magnification-robust WSI analysis using a unified embedding space

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: AI model automates Fagotti score estimation from diagnostic laparoscopy videos for advanced ovarian cancer, providing standardized surgical feasibility assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fagotti score assessment at diagnostic laparoscopy is subjective and operator-dependent, limiting reproducibility and widespread use for surgical planning in advanced ovarian cancer.

Method: Retrospective collection of DL videos with FS assessments; manual annotation of FS-relevant frames; deep learning models trained to identify relevant frames, segment anatomical structures and peritoneal carcinosis, and predict video-level FS and indication to surgery.

Result: Segmentation achieved Dice scores of 70±3% for anatomical structures and 56±3% for PC; video-level classification achieved F1-scores of 74±3% and 73±4%; FS prediction showed normalized RMSE of 1.39±0.18 and 1.15±0.08; ItS reached F1-scores of 80±8% and 80±2% in development and test datasets.

Conclusion: First AI model to predict cytoreductive surgery feasibility by automating FS estimation from DL videos, offering reproducible and reliable performance to support standardized intraoperative tumor burden assessment and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Advanced Ovarian Cancer (AOC) is often diagnosed at an advanced stage with peritoneal carcinosis (PC). Fagotti score (FS) assessment at diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) guides treatment planning by estimating surgical resectability, but its subjective and operator-dependent nature limits reproducibility and widespread use. Videos of patients undergoing DL with concomitant FS assessments at a referral center were retrospectively collected and divided into a development dataset, for data annotation, AI training and evaluation, and an independent test dataset, for internal validation. In the development dataset, FS-relevant frames were manually annotated for anatomical structures and PC. Deep learning models were trained to automatically identify FS-relevant frames, segment structures and PC, and predict video-level FS and indication to surgery (ItS). AI performance was evaluated using Dice score for segmentation, F1-scores for anatomical stations (AS) and ItS prediction, and root mean square error (RMSE) for final FS estimation. In the development dataset, the segmentation model trained on 7,311 frames, achieved Dice scores of 70$\pm$3% for anatomical structures and 56$\pm$3% for PC. Video-level AS classification achieved F1-scores of 74$\pm$3% and 73$\pm$4%, FS prediction showed normalized RMSE values of 1.39$\pm$0.18 and 1.15$\pm$0.08, and ItS reached F1-scores of 80$\pm$8% and 80$\pm$2% in the development (n=101) and independent test datasets (n=50), respectively. This is the first AI model to predict the feasibility of cytoreductive surgery providing automated FS estimation from DL videos. Its reproducible and reliable performance across datasets suggests that AI can support surgeons through standardized intraoperative tumor burden assessment and clinical decision-making in AOC.

*Paul J. Weiser,Jiye Kim,Jongho Lee,Amirmohammad Shamaei,Gulnur Ungan,Malte Hoffmann,Antoine Klauser,Berkin Bilgic,Ovidiu C. Andronesi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning pipeline enables simultaneous high-resolution metabolic, QSM, and myelin water fraction imaging from water-unsuppressed MRSI at 7T, eliminating need for water suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Water-unsuppressed MRSI allows simultaneous imaging of water and metabolites but faces challenges from large water sidebands that interfere with metabolic fitting, especially at ultra-high field.

Method: Developed WALINET+ deep learning network to remove lipids, water signal, and sidebands from 7T wu-MRSI data acquired with non-cartesian ECCENTRIC sampling and ultra-short echo time. Used physics-informed networks for reconstruction and metabolite fitting, leveraging water signal for absolute quantification, QSM, and MWF.

Result: WALINET+ achieved <2% NRMSE in simulations and <20% bias in vivo compared to water-suppressed MRSI. Several metabolites showed higher SNR in wu-MRSI. QSM and MWF from wu-MRSI agreed well with GRE data (0 ppm/5.5% bias). Achieved 2 mm isotropic resolution in 12 minutes.

Conclusion: High-quality simultaneous metabolic, QSM, and MWF mapping is feasible with ECCENTRIC wu-MRSI at 7T. WALINET+ robustly removes water sidebands while preserving metabolites, eliminating need for water suppression and separate water acquisitions.

Abstract: Purpose: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) maps endogenous brain metabolism while suppressing the overwhelming water signal. Water-unsuppressed MRSI (wu-MRSI) allows simultaneous imaging of water and metabolites, but large water sidebands cause challenges for metabolic fitting. We developed an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline to overcome these challenges at ultra-high field. Methods:Fast high-resolution wu-MRSI was acquired at 7T with non-cartesian ECCENTRIC sampling and ultra-short echo time. A water and lipid removal network (WALINET+) was developed to remove lipids, water signal, and sidebands. MRSI reconstruction was performed by DeepER and a physics-informed network for metabolite fitting. Water signal was used for absolute metabolite quantification, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and myelin water fraction imaging (MWF). Results: WALINET+ provided the lowest NRMSE (< 2%) in simulations and in vivo the smallest bias (< 20%) and limits-of-agreement (+-63%) between wu-MRSI and ws-MRSI scans. Several metabolites such as creatine and glutamate showed higher SNR in wu-MRSI. QSM and MWF obtained from wu-MRSI and GRE showed good agreement with 0 ppm/5.5% bias and +-0.05 ppm/ +- 12.75% limits-of-agreement. Conclusion: High-quality metabolic, QSM, and MWF mapping of the human brain can be obtained simultaneously by ECCENTRIC wu-MRSI at 7T with 2 mm isotropic resolution in 12 min. WALINET+ robustly removes water sidebands while preserving metabolite signal, eliminating the need for water suppression and separate water acquisitions.

*Nalini M. Singh,Tiffany Chien,Arthur R. C. McCray,Colin Ophus,Laura Waller*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Direct atomic structure determination from electron tomography using Gaussian parameterization instead of volumetric reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical tomography algorithms use intermediate volumetric representations that require post-processing to extract atomic structures, which may be suboptimal and sensitive to imaging artifacts.

Method: Reformulate tomography as direct atomic structure recovery by parameterizing structures as collections of Gaussians with learnable positions and properties, imposing strong physical priors.

Result: Improved robustness to real-world imaging artifacts demonstrated through simulated experiments and proof-of-concept experimental data validation.

Conclusion: The Gaussian parameterization approach shows practical potential for materials characterization with TEM, offering more direct and robust atomic structure determination.

Abstract: Atomic electron tomography (AET) enables the determination of 3D atomic structures by acquiring a sequence of 2D tomographic projection measurements of a particle and then computationally solving for its underlying 3D representation. Classical tomography algorithms solve for an intermediate volumetric representation that is post-processed into the atomic structure of interest. In this paper, we reformulate the tomographic inverse problem to solve directly for the locations and properties of individual atoms. We parameterize an atomic structure as a collection of Gaussians, whose positions and properties are learnable. This representation imparts a strong physical prior on the learned structure, which we show yields improved robustness to real-world imaging artifacts. Simulated experiments and a proof-of-concept result on experimentally-acquired data confirm our method's potential for practical applications in materials characterization and analysis with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).

Result: Efficient Omni ProtoSeg (EO-ProtoSeg) achieves IoU scores of 88.15% for OD and 71.17% for OC on REFUGE dataset using just one sparsely labeled image, outperforming few-shot and semi-supervised methods requiring more labeled data.

Conclusion: The proposed meta-learners, particularly EO-ProtoSeg, provide effective solutions for few-shot weakly-supervised segmentation in glaucoma diagnosis, offering comparable performance to unsupervised domain adaptation methods with significantly fewer parameters and no retraining requirements.

Abstract: This study develops meta-learners for few-shot weakly-supervised segmentation (FWS) to address the challenge of optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) segmentation for glaucoma diagnosis with limited labeled fundus images. We significantly improve existing meta-learners by introducing Omni meta-training which balances data usage and diversifies the number of shots. We also develop their efficient versions that reduce computational costs. In addition, we develop sparsification techniques that generate more customizable and representative scribbles and other sparse labels. After evaluating multiple datasets, we find that Omni and efficient versions outperform the original versions, with the best meta-learner being Efficient Omni ProtoSeg (EO-ProtoSeg). It achieves intersection over union (IoU) scores of 88.15% for OD and 71.17% for OC on the REFUGE dataset using just one sparsely labeled image, outperforming few-shot and semi-supervised methods which require more labeled images. Its best performance reaches 86.80% for OD and 71.78%for OC on DRISHTIGS, 88.21% for OD and 73.70% for OC on REFUGE, 80.39% for OD and 52.65% for OC on REFUGE. EO-ProtoSeg is comparable to unsupervised domain adaptation methods yet much lighter with less than two million parameters and does not require any retraining.

*Youmin Xu,Mengxi Guo,Shijie Zhao,Weiqi Li,Junlin Li,Li Zhang,Jian Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: AVCC is an audio-visual cross-modal compression framework that jointly compresses both audio and video streams by aligning them through a unified diffusion process, outperforming VVC and GFVC methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative face video coding methods focus only on video motion while ignoring audio's significant bitrate contribution, despite the known correlation between audio and lip movements. This cross-modal coherence hasn't been systematically exploited for compression.

Method: Extracts motion information from video and tokenizes audio features, then aligns them through a unified audio-video diffusion process for synchronized reconstruction from a shared representation. Can reconstruct one modality from another in low-rate scenarios.

Result: Significantly outperforms Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard and state-of-the-art GFVC schemes in rate-distortion performance.

Conclusion: Paves the way for more efficient multimodal communication systems by effectively exploiting audio-visual correlations for compression.

Abstract: Generative face video coding (GFVC) is vital for modern applications like video conferencing, yet existing methods primarily focus on video motion while neglecting the significant bitrate contribution of audio. Despite the well-established correlation between audio and lip movements, this cross-modal coherence has not been systematically exploited for compression. To address this, we propose an Audio-Visual Cross-Modal Compression (AVCC) framework that jointly compresses audio and video streams. Our framework extracts motion information from video and tokenizes audio features, then aligns them through a unified audio-video diffusion process. This allows synchronized reconstruction of both modalities from a shared representation. In extremely low-rate scenarios, AVCC can even reconstruct one modality from the other. Experiments show that AVCC significantly outperforms the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard and state-of-the-art GFVC schemes in rate-distortion performance, paving the way for more efficient multimodal communication systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Distill multi-step Stable Diffusion 2.1 into a compact one-step image-to-image model using Consistent Score Identity Distillation (CiD); 2) Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of attention modules guided by Rate-Perception loss and differentiable codec surrogate.

Result: Substantial R-P gains with up to 30.13% BD-rate reduction in DISTS on Kodak dataset, delivering superior subjective visual quality. The method integrates seamlessly with standard codecs without modification.

Conclusion: The work successfully pioneers R-P optimization for compression preprocessing by adapting large-scale pre-trained diffusion models, demonstrating significant perceptual quality improvements while maintaining compatibility with existing codecs.

Abstract: Preprocessing is a well-established technique for optimizing compression, yet existing methods are predominantly Rate-Distortion (R-D) optimized and constrained by pixel-level fidelity. This work pioneers a shift towards Rate-Perception (R-P) optimization by, for the first time, adapting a large-scale pre-trained diffusion model for compression preprocessing. We propose a two-stage framework: first, we distill the multi-step Stable Diffusion 2.1 into a compact, one-step image-to-image model using Consistent Score Identity Distillation (CiD). Second, we perform a parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the distilled model's attention modules, guided by a Rate-Perception loss and a differentiable codec surrogate. Our method seamlessly integrates with standard codecs without any modification and leverages the model's powerful generative priors to enhance texture and mitigate artifacts. Experiments show substantial R-P gains, achieving up to a 30.13% BD-rate reduction in DISTS on the Kodak dataset and delivering superior subjective visual quality.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Hybrid-Net: A deep neural network for spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging that simultaneously estimates blood oxygenation saturation (sO2) and segments blood vessels without needing optical fluence estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging can noninvasively estimate blood oxygenation, but accurate results require precise optical fluence estimation, which is challenging in heterogeneous tissue due to wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering differences.

Method: Developed Hybrid-Net, a deep neural network that simultaneously estimates sO2 in blood vessels and segments vessels from background tissue. Trained first on simulated sPA data from 3D Monte Carlo simulations of light transport in breast tissue (700nm & 850nm), then retrained on experimental sPA data from tissue-mimicking phantoms with embedded blood pools.

Result: Achieved segmentation accuracy ≥0.978 in simulations (0dB-35dB noise) and 0.998 in experiments; sO2 mean squared error ≤0.048 in simulations and 0.003 in experiments, showing accurate blood oxygenation estimation without optical fluence calculation.

Conclusion: Hybrid-Net provides accurate blood oxygenation estimation without requiring optical fluence estimation, potentially improving in-vivo sO2 measurement in spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging.

Abstract: Spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) imaging can potentially estimate blood oxygenation saturation (sO2) in vivo noninvasively. However, quantitatively accurate results require accurate optical fluence estimates. Robust modeling in heterogeneous tissue, where light with different wavelengths can experience significantly different absorption and scattering, is difficult. In this work, we developed a deep neural network (Hybrid-Net) for sPA imaging to simultaneously estimate sO2 in blood vessels and segment those vessels from surrounding background tissue. sO2 error was minimized only in blood vessels segmented in Hybrid-Net, resulting in more accurate predictions. Hybrid-Net was first trained on simulated sPA data (at 700 nm and 850 nm) representing initial pressure distributions from three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of light transport in breast tissue. Then, for experimental verification, the network was retrained on experimental sPA data (at 700 nm and 850 nm) acquired from simple tissue mimicking phantoms with an embedded blood pool. Quantitative measures were used to evaluate Hybrid-Net performance with an averaged segmentation accuracy of >= 0.978 in simulations with varying noise levels (0dB-35dB) and 0.998 in the experiment, and an averaged sO2 mean squared error of <= 0.048 in simulations with varying noise levels (0dB-35dB) and 0.003 in the experiment. Overall, these results show that Hybrid-Net can provide accurate blood oxygenation without estimating the optical fluence, and this study could lead to improvements in in-vivo sO2 estimation.

*Naveenkumar G Venkataswamy,Masudul H Imtiaz,Stephanie Schuckers*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Pediatric iris recognition remains viable across 9-year longitudinal study with <0.5% false non-match rates using pediatric-calibrated thresholds, though algorithm-dependent temporal behaviors and acquisition quality dominate performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread deployment of iris recognition for children in national ID programs (India's Aadhaar, Canada's NEXUS), biometric permanence in pediatric populations remains poorly understood, necessitating longitudinal evaluation of iris recognition stability throughout childhood and adolescence.

Method: Longitudinal study of 276 subjects enrolled at ages 4-12 with follow-up to 9 years using 18,318 near-infrared iris images acquired semi-annually. Evaluated commercial (VeriEye) and open-source (OpenIris) systems using linear mixed-effects models controlling for enrollment age, developmental maturation, elapsed time, image quality, and physiological factors.

Result: False non-match rates remained below 0.5% across 9 years using pediatric-calibrated thresholds. Algorithm-dependent temporal behaviors observed: VeriEye's apparent decline reflects developmental confounding, while OpenIris shows modest genuine temporal aging (0.5 SD over 8 years). Image quality and pupil dilation constancy dominated performance (3.0-3.5 SD effects). Failures concentrated in 9.4% of subjects with persistent acquisition challenges rather than accumulating over time.

Conclusion: Iris recognition remains viable throughout childhood and adolescence with proper imaging control. Findings justify extending conservative re-enrollment policies to 10-12 year validity periods for high-quality enrollments at ages 7+, with acquisition conditions being the primary limitation rather than biometric permanence.

Abstract: Biometric permanence in pediatric populations remains poorly understood despite widespread deployment of iris recognition for children in national identity programs such as India's Aadhaar and trusted traveler programs like Canada's NEXUS. This study presents a comprehensive longitudinal evaluation of pediatric iris recognition, analyzing 276 subjects enrolled between ages 4-12 and followed up to nine years through adolescence. Using 18,318 near-infrared iris images acquired semi-annually, we evaluated commercial (VeriEye) and open-source (OpenIris) systems through linear mixed-effects models that disentangle enrollment age, developmental maturation, and elapsed time while controlling for image quality and physiological factors. False non-match rates remained below 0.5% across the nine-year period for both matchers using pediatric-calibrated thresholds, approaching adult-level performance. However, we reveal significant algorithm-dependent temporal behaviors: VeriEye's apparent decline reflects developmental confounding across enrollment cohorts rather than genuine template aging, while OpenIris exhibits modest but genuine temporal aging (0.5 standard deviations over eight years). Image quality and pupil dilation constancy dominated longitudinal performance, with dilation effects reaching 3.0-3.5 standard deviations, substantially exceeding temporal factors. Failures concentrated in 9.4% of subjects with persistent acquisition challenges rather than accumulating with elapsed time, confirming acquisition conditions as the primary limitation. These findings justify extending conservative re-enrollment policies, potentially to 10-12 year validity periods for high-quality enrollments at ages 7+, and demonstrate iris recognition remains viable throughout childhood and adolescence with proper imaging control.

TL;DR: CUVIRIS dataset enables visible spectrum iris recognition on smartphones using standardized capture and lightweight models, achieving high accuracy with OSIRIS (97.9% TAR at 0.01% FAR) and IrisFormer (0.057% EER).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smartphone-based visible spectrum iris recognition is challenging due to lighting variability, pigmentation effects, and lack of standardized capture protocols, limiting practical deployment despite being low-cost and accessible.

Method: Created CUVIRIS dataset (752 ISO-compliant images from 47 subjects) with custom Android app enforcing real-time quality control; developed LightIrisNet (MobileNetV3-based segmentation for on-device use) and adapted IrisFormer transformer matcher to VIS domain.

Result: OSIRIS achieved 97.9% TAR at 0.01% FAR (EER=0.76%) on CUVIRIS; IrisFormer trained on UBIRIS.v2 achieved 0.057% EER. Released Android app, models, and dataset subset for reproducibility.

Conclusion: With standardized acquisition and VIS-adapted lightweight models, accurate iris recognition on commodity smartphones is feasible under controlled conditions, bringing this biometric modality closer to practical deployment.

Abstract: Smartphone-based iris recognition in the visible spectrum (VIS) offers a low-cost and accessible biometric alternative but remains a challenge due to lighting variability, pigmentation effects, and the limited adoption of standardized capture protocols. In this work, we present CUVIRIS, a dataset of 752 ISO/IEC 29794-6 compliant iris images from 47 subjects, collected with a custom Android application that enforces real-time framing, sharpness assessment, and quality feedback. We further introduce LightIrisNet, a MobileNetV3-based multi-task segmentation model optimized for on-device deployment. In addition, we adapt IrisFormer, a transformer-based matcher, to the VIS domain. We evaluate OSIRIS and IrisFormer under a standardized protocol and benchmark against published CNN baselines reported in prior work. On CUVIRIS, the open-source OSIRIS system achieves a TAR of 97.9% at FAR = 0.01 (EER = 0.76%), while IrisFormer, trained only on the UBIRIS.v2 dataset, achieves an EER of 0.057\%. To support reproducibility, we release the Android application, LightIrisNet, trained IrisFormer weights, and a subset of the CUVIRIS dataset. These results show that, with standardized acquisition and VIS-adapted lightweight models, accurate iris recognition on commodity smartphones is feasible under controlled conditions, bringing this modality closer to practical deployment.

TL;DR: AI-based approach using multimodal imaging (CT/MRI) and clinical data to predict brain metastasis recurrence after radiotherapy, showing feasibility of radiomics models and potential link between radiation dose discrepancies and recurrence risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain metastases affect 20-40% of cancer patients, and early prediction of recurrence after radiotherapy could enable timely clinical intervention and improve patient outcomes.

Method: Retrospective study of 97 patients (53 after inclusion criteria) with CT and MRI scans pre-treatment and at first follow-up. Used radiomics feature extraction, delta radiomics for temporal changes, multiple machine learning classifiers, and analyzed treatment planning vs. delivered dose discrepancies.

Result: Demonstrated feasibility of radiomics-based ensemble models for recurrence prediction despite sample size and class imbalance limitations. Suggested potential association between radiation dose discrepancies and recurrence risk.

Conclusion: Supports further investigation of AI-driven tools for clinical decision-making in brain metastasis management, with radiomics showing promise for recurrence prediction.

Abstract: Brain metastases affect approximately between 20% and 40% of cancer patients and are commonly treated with radiotherapy or radiosurgery. Early prediction of recurrence following treatment could enable timely clinical intervention and improve patient outcomes. This study proposes an artificial intelligence based approach for predicting brain metastasis recurrence using multimodal imaging and clinical data. A retrospective cohort of 97 patients was collected, including Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquired before treatment and at first follow-up, together with relevant clinical variables. Image preprocessing included CT windowing and artifact reduction, MRI enhancement, and multimodal CT MRI registration. After applying inclusion criteria, 53 patients were retained for analysis. Radiomics features were extracted from the imaging data, and delta radiomics was employed to characterize temporal changes between pre-treatment and follow-up scans. Multiple machine learning classifiers were trained and evaluated, including an analysis of discrepancies between treatment planning target volumes and delivered isodose volumes. Despite limitations related to sample size and class imbalance, the results demonstrate the feasibility of radiomics based models, namely ensemble models, for recurrence prediction and suggest a potential association between radiation dose discrepancies and recurrence risk. This work supports further investigation of AI-driven tools to assist clinical decision-making in brain metastasis management.

*Reza Mohammadkhani,Azad Azizzadeh,Seyed Vahab Al-Din Makki,John Thompson,Maziar Nekovee*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the impact of low-resolution quantization in massive MIMO systems under imperfect CSI, develops BER approximations for M-QAM with ZF detection, and proposes a framework to jointly optimize quantization resolution, power, and pilot length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing studies assume perfect CSI, but realistic massive MIMO systems with low-resolution quantization suffer from quantization noise affecting both channel estimation and data transmission. There's a need for accurate performance analysis under imperfect CSI conditions to enable practical system optimization.

Method: Develops a tight approximation for BER of uncoded M-QAM with zero-forcing detection based on LMMSE channel estimation. Models quantization noise impact on both channel estimation and data transmission in uplink massive MIMO systems.

Result: Provides analytical BER approximations that enable joint optimization of quantization resolution, transmit power, and pilot length. Demonstrates that in a 16-QAM system, extending pilots by 2.5x and lowering power by 0.5dB allows 3-bit quantization to match full-resolution BER.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a fast, accurate alternative to Monte Carlo simulations for system optimization under quantization constraints, enabling practical design trade-offs between quantization resolution, power consumption, and pilot overhead.

Abstract: Low-resolution quantization is essential to reduce implementation cost and power consumption in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems for 5G and 6G. While most existing studies assume perfect channel state information (CSI), we model the impact of coarse quantization noise on both channel estimation and data transmission, yielding a more realistic assessment of system performance under imperfect CSI conditions in the uplink. We develop a tight approximation for the bit-error ratio (BER) of uncoded M-QAM with zero-forcing detection, based on the linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) channel estimate. These analytical results enable compensation strategies that jointly optimize quantization resolution, transmit power, and pilot length across different numbers of users and base station antennas. We further demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework through several design scenarios that highlight its effectiveness in optimizing system parameters and improving energy efficiency under quantization constraints. For example, in a 16-QAM system, extending the pilot sequence by 2.5 times and lowering transmit power by 0.5 dB enables a 3-bit quantized system to match the BER of the full-resolution case.

### [222] [CF-Net: A Cross-Feature Reconstruction Network for High-Accuracy 1-Bit Target Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15105)
*Jundong Qi,Weize Sun,Shaowu Chen,Lei Huang,Qiuchen Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: CF-Net is a two-stage deep learning framework that enables high-accuracy target classification directly from 1-bit radar data without oversampling, achieving performance comparable to 16-bit methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 1-bit quantization in radar systems enables direct high-frequency sampling but causes significant information loss. While oversampling can compensate, it's impractical at high frequencies. The paper aims to achieve accurate classification from 1-bit data without oversampling.

Method: Proposes CF-Net with two stages: 1) Self-supervised pre-training using dual-branch U-Net to restore 16-bit images from 1-bit data via cross-feature reconstruction, and 2) Fine-tuning the pre-trained encoder for multi-class target classification.

Result: Experiments on two radar target datasets show CF-Net effectively extracts discriminative features from 1-bit imagery, achieving comparable and even superior accuracy to some 16-bit methods without oversampling.

Conclusion: CF-Net demonstrates that deep learning can overcome extreme quantization limitations in radar systems, enabling high-accuracy target classification directly from 1-bit data without the need for oversampling.

Abstract: Target classification is a fundamental task in radar systems, and its performance critically depends on the quantization precision of the signal. While high-precision quantization (e.g. 16-bit) is well established, 1-bit quantization offers distinct advantages by enabling direct sampling at high frequencies and eliminating complex intermediate stages. However, its extreme quantization leads to significant information loss. Although higher sampling rates can compensate for this loss, such oversampling is impractical at the high frequencies targeted for direct sampling. To achieve high-accuracy classification directly from 1-bit radar data under the same sampling rate, this paper proposes a novel two-stage deep learning framework, CF-Net. First, we introduce a self-supervised pre-training strategy based on a dual-branch U-Net architecture. This network learns to restore high-fidelity 16-bit images from their 1-bit counterparts via a cross-feature reconstruction task, forcing the 1-bit encoder to learn robust features despite extreme quantization. Subsequently, this pre-trained encoder is repurposed and fine-tuned for the downstream multi-class target classification task. Experiments on two radar target datasets demonstrate that CF-Net can effectively extract discriminative features from 1-bit imagery, achieving comparable and even superior accuracy to some 16-bit methods without oversampling.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Large AI models can transform base stations into intelligent agents for 6G systems, integrating perception, communication, and computation in safety-critical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G requires intelligence at the core of wireless architecture, fusing perception, communication, and computation into a single closed-loop system. Traditional base stations need to evolve into intelligent agents to meet these demands.

Method: Proposes an intelligent base station agent (IBSA) architecture with perception-cognition-execution pipeline and cloud-edge-end collaboration. Uses parameter-efficient adaptation and studies two scenarios: cooperative vehicle-road perception for autonomous driving, and UAV safety monitoring against unauthorized drones.

Result: Presents a comprehensive framework covering LAM design/training, efficient edge-cloud inference, multi-modal perception/actuation, trustworthy security, and holistic evaluation metrics. Identifies IBSAs as practical path toward integrated 6G systems.

Conclusion: LAM-enabled intelligent base station agents represent a practical evolution toward native 6G systems with integrated perception, communication, and computation, though challenges remain in benchmarks, continual adaptation, trustworthy decision-making, and standardization.

Abstract: The advent of sixth-generation (6G) places intelligence at the core of wireless architecture, fusing perception, communication, and computation into a single closed-loop. This paper argues that large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) can endow base stations with perception, reasoning, and acting capabilities, thus transforming them into intelligent base station agents (IBSAs). We first review the historical evolution of BSs from single-functional analog infrastructure to distributed, software-defined, and finally LAM-empowered IBSA, highlighting the accompanying changes in architecture, hardware platforms, and deployment. We then present an IBSA architecture that couples a perception-cognition-execution pipeline with cloud-edge-end collaboration and parameter-efficient adaptation. Subsequently,we study two representative scenarios: (i) cooperative vehicle-road perception for autonomous driving, and (ii) ubiquitous base station support for low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicle safety monitoring and response against unauthorized drones. On this basis, we analyze key enabling technologies spanning LAM design and training, efficient edge-cloud inference, multi-modal perception and actuation, as well as trustworthy security and governance. We further propose a holistic evaluation framework and benchmark considerations that jointly cover communication performance, perception accuracy, decision-making reliability, safety, and energy efficiency. Finally, we distill open challenges on benchmarks, continual adaptation, trustworthy decision-making, and standardization. Together, this work positions LAM-enabled IBSAs as a practical path toward integrated perception, communication, and computation native, safety-critical 6G systems.

### [224] [QoS-Aware Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Joint Link Selection and Trajectory Optimization in SAGIN-Supported UAV Mobility Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15119)
*Jiayang Wan,Ke He,Yafei Wang,Fan Liu,Wenjin Wang,Shi Jin*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Proposes a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning framework for UAV mobility management in space-air-ground integrated networks, combining discrete link selection with continuous trajectory optimization to improve throughput and QoS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs face connectivity challenges due to altitude and mobility variations in 3D space. Single networks can't ensure reliable coverage, so SAGIN architecture is needed. However, heterogeneous networks have coverage and signal disparities that require intelligent mobility management.

Method: Two-level multi-agent hierarchical DRL framework: top-level uses DDQN for discrete link selection with compact action space; lower-level uses constrained SAC (CSAC) with Lagrangian multipliers for continuous trajectory optimization under QoS constraints. Extended to multi-UAV scenarios using CTDE paradigm.

Result: Simulation results show the proposed scheme substantially outperforms existing benchmarks in throughput, link switching frequency, and QoS satisfaction.

Conclusion: The hierarchical DRL framework effectively solves the joint optimization problem of UAV mobility management in SAGIN, enabling stable policy learning for both discrete and continuous actions while satisfying QoS constraints, with scalability to multi-UAV scenarios.

Abstract: Due to the significant variations in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) altitude and horizontal mobility, it becomes difficult for any single network to ensure continuous and reliable threedimensional coverage. Towards that end, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has emerged as an essential architecture for enabling ubiquitous UAV connectivity. To address the pronounced disparities in coverage and signal characteristics across heterogeneous networks, this paper formulates UAV mobility management in SAGIN as a constrained multi-objective joint optimization problem. The formulation couples discrete link selection with continuous trajectory optimization. Building on this, we propose a two-level multi-agent hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework that decomposes the problem into two alternately solvable subproblems. To map complex link selection decisions into a compact discrete action space, we conceive a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm in the top-level, which achieves stable and high-quality policy learning through double Q-value estimation. To handle the continuous trajectory action space while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints, we integrate the maximum-entropy mechanism of the soft actor-critic (SAC) and employ a Lagrangian-based constrained SAC (CSAC) algorithm in the lower-level that dynamically adjusts the Lagrange multipliers to balance constraint satisfaction and policy optimization. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be extended to multi-UAV scenarios under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, which enables more generalizable policies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms existing benchmarks in throughput, link switching frequency and QoS satisfaction.

*Joachim Tapparel,Andreas Burg*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper presents an empirical propagation channel modeling study for LoRa networks using SDR-based measurements in campus environments, including UAV and pedestrian scenarios with LoS and NLoS conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LoRa networks rapidly densify, there's a critical need for tailored channel models to evaluate network performance. Existing cellular channel models don't capture LoRa's specific characteristics: long-range operation with small bandwidth (~250kHz), requiring dedicated measurement campaigns and modeling efforts.

Method: The authors use an SDR-based testbed to collect and publish a dataset of LoRa frames transmitted in a campus environment. The dataset includes IQ samples of received frames at multiple locations with high time resolution. They analyze this data to derive empirical propagation channel models for three scenarios: UAV line-of-sight (LoS), UAV non-LoS, and pedestrian non-LoS.

Result: The paper produces a publicly available dataset of LoRa frames with IQ samples and synchronization information. From this data, they derive empirical propagation channel models that include receiver correlation over distance for the three different scenarios. The dataset enables evaluation of receiver algorithms using experimental data.

Conclusion: This work addresses the gap in LoRa-specific channel modeling by providing empirical models based on real-world measurements. The published dataset and derived models support performance evaluation of LoRa networks and enable testing of receiver algorithms with experimental data, contributing to better network planning and optimization for IoT deployments.

Abstract: LoRa is one of the most widely used low-power wide-area network technology for the Internet of Things. To achieve long-range communication with low power consumption at a low cost, LoRa uses a chirp spread spectrum modulation and transmits in the sub-GHz unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency bands. Due to the rapid densification of IoT networks, it is crucial to obtain tailored channel models to evaluate the performance of LoRa networks. While channel models for cellular technologies have been investigated extensively, specific characteristics of LoRa transmissions operating at long range with a rather small (~ 250kHz) bandwidth require dedicated measurement campaigns and modeling efforts. In this work, we leverage an SDR-based testbed to gather and publish a dataset of LoRa frames transmitted in a campus environment. The dataset includes IQ samples of the received frames at multiple locations and allows for the evaluation of channel variations with high time resolution. Using the gathered data, we derive empirical propagation channel models for LoRa that include receiver correlation over distance for three scenarios: unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) line-of-sight (LoS), UAV non-LoS, and pedestrian non-LoS. Furthermore, the dataset is annotated with synchronization information, enabling the evaluation of receiver algorithms using experimental data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LC-RISs offer energy-efficient mmWave coverage but suffer from long reconfiguration times (tens of ms), limiting dynamic applications. Prior work focused on hardware or static scenarios, leaving dynamic optimization unaddressed.

Method: Proposed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm that adapts LC-RIS phase shifts without perfect channel state information, balancing SNR and configuration time tradeoff.

Result: Validated through high-fidelity ray tracing simulations using measurement data from an LC-RIS prototype, demonstrating adaptive control potential for dynamic LC-RIS-assisted mmWave systems.

Conclusion: The RL-based optimization framework successfully addresses the dynamic control challenge of LC-RISs, enabling their practical application in mobile mmWave scenarios by managing the reconfiguration time vs. performance tradeoff.

Abstract: To enhance coverage and signal quality in millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a game-changing solution to manipulate the wireless environment. Traditional semiconductor-based RISs face scalability issues due to high power consumption. Meanwhile, liquid crystal-based RISs (LC-RISs) offer energy-efficient and cost-effective operation even for large arrays. However, this promise has a caveat. LC-RISs suffer from long reconfiguration times, on the order of tens of milliseconds, which limits their applicability in dynamic scenarios. To date, prior works have focused on hardware design aspects or static scenarios to address this limitation, but little attention has been paid to optimization solutions for dynamic settings. Our paper fills this gap by proposing a reinforcement learning-based optimization framework to dynamically control the phase shifts of LC-RISs and maximize the data rate of a moving user. Specifically, we propose a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm that adapts the LC-RIS phase shifts without requiring perfect channel state information and balances the tradeoff between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and configuration time. We validate our approach through high-fidelity ray tracing simulations, leveraging measurement data from an LC-RIS prototype. Our results demonstrate the potential of our solution to bring adaptive control to dynamic LC-RIS-assisted mmWave systems.

*Colin Cros,Laurent Ferro-Famil*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: MoMET is a low-complexity method for estimating mean DOA, spread, and power of narrow diffuse sources without requiring prior knowledge of source distribution, using moment-matching covariance techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DOA estimation methods for diffuse sources rely on prior assumptions about source angular density, which can lead to significant estimation biases when these assumptions are incorrect.

Method: MoMET characterizes unknown source density by its mean DOA and first central moments, estimated through covariance matching techniques that fit empirical measurement covariance to moment-modeled covariance.

Result: The method is robust to incorrect model assumptions, numerically efficient, with derived asymptotic bias and covariance, and demonstrated performance through simulations.

Conclusion: MoMET provides a practical solution for diffuse source parameter estimation without requiring prior distribution knowledge, offering robustness and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation is a fundamental problem in signal processing. Diffuse sources, whose power density cannot be represented with a single angular coordinate, are usually characterized based on prior assumptions, which associate the source angular density with a specific set of functions. However, these assumptions can lead to significant estimation biases when they are incorrect. This paper introduces the Moment-Matching Estimation Technique (MoMET), a low-complexity method for estimating the mean DOA, spread, and power of a narrow diffuse source without requiring prior knowledge on the source distribution. The unknown source density is characterized by its mean DOA and its first central moments, which are estimated through covariance matching techniques which fit the empirical covariance of the measurements to that modeled from the moments. The MoMET parameterization is robust to incorrect model assumptions, and numerically efficient. The asymptotic bias and covariance of the new estimator are derived and its performance is demonstrated through simulations.

*Jie Zhou,Junhao Xie*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes CFAR DL-AMF detectors with optimal loading factors for improved detection performance in large dimensional regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two limitations in diagonally loaded AMF detectors: lack of CFAR property with respect to arbitrary covariance matrices, and absence of selection criteria for optimal loading factor to maximize detection probability.

Method: Analyze asymptotic performance under large dimensional regime (LDR) where dimension and sample size tend to infinity. Derive two CFAR DL detectors by normalizing with appropriate deterministic quantities. Derive asymptotically optimal loading factor λ_opt by maximizing asymptotic detection probability expression.

Result: Proposed CFAR-DL-SCMF and CFAR-DL-AMF achieve CFAR with respect to covariance matrix, target steering vector and loading factor. Optimal versions (opt-CFAR-DL-SCMF and opt-CFAR-DL-AMF) consistently outperform existing methods like EL-AMF and persymmetric AMF in both full-rank and low-rank clutter environments.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses both limitations of DL-AMF detectors by providing CFAR DL detectors with optimal loading factor selection, validated through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations.

Abstract: This paper addresses two critical limitations in diagonally loaded (DL) adaptive matched filter (AMF) detector: (1) the lack of CFAR property with respect to arbitrary covariance matrices, and (2) the absence of selection criteria for optimal loading factor from the perspective of maximizing the detection probability (Pd). We provide solutions to both challenges through a comprehensive analysis for the asymptotic performance of DL-AMF under large dimensional regime (LDR) where the dimension N and sample size K tend to infinity whereas their ratio N/K converges to a constant c\in(0,1). The analytical results show that any DL detectors constructed by normalizing the random variable |a|2=|sH(R+λIN)-1y0|2 with a deterministic quantity or a random variable that converges almost surely to a deterministic value will exhibit equivalent performance under LDR. Following this idea, we derive two CFAR DL detectors: CFAR DL semi-clairvoyant matched filter (CFAR-DL-SCMF) detector and CFAR DL adaptive matched filter (CFAR-DL-AMF) detector, by normalizing |a|2 with an appropriate deterministic quantity and its consistent estimate, respectively. The theoretical analysis and simulations show that both CFAR-DL-SCMF and CFAR-DL-AMF achieve CFAR with respect to covariance matrix, target steering vector and loading factor. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotically optimal loading factor λ_opt by maximizing the explicit expression of asymptotic Pd. For practical implementation, we provide a consistent estimator for λ_opt under LDR. Based on λ_opt and its consistent estimate, we establish the optimal CFAR-DL-SCMF (opt-CFAR-DL-SCMF) and the optimal CFAR-DL-AMF (opt-CFAR-DL-AMF). Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed opt-CFAR-DL-SCMF and opt-CFAR-DL-AMF consistently outperform EL-AMF and persymmetric AMF in both full-rank and low-rank clutter plus noise environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Channel estimation for BD-RIS is more challenging than conventional RIS due to complex connections and larger number of coefficients. Existing pilot-assisted methods are inefficient, and there's a need for training-free approaches that work with time-varying channels under mobility.

Method: Two semi-blind tensor-based receivers: 1) Two-stage method transforming fourth-order PARATUCK model into third-order PARAFAC model, 2) Single-stage iterative process based on fourth-order TUCKER decomposition. Both leverage tensor decomposition of received signals without training sequences.

Result: Derived identifiability conditions for reliable joint recovery. Numerical results demonstrate performance advantages and trade-offs over existing solutions, showing effective joint channel and symbol estimation without training overhead.

Conclusion: Proposed semi-blind tensor-based approach successfully eliminates training sequences for BD-RIS systems, enabling efficient joint channel and symbol estimation in time-varying mobile scenarios with performance improvements over conventional methods.

Abstract: The beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is a recent architecture in which scattering elements are interconnected to enhance the degrees of freedom for wave control, yielding performance gains over traditional single-connected RISs. For BD-RIS, channel estimation - well-studied for conventional RIS - becomes more challenging due to the complex connections and a larger number of coefficients. Prior works rely on pilot-assisted estimation followed by data decoding. This paper introduces a semi-blind tensor-based approach for joint channel and symbol estimation that eliminates the need for training sequences by leveraging data symbols directly. A practical scenario with time-varying user terminal-RIS channels under mobility is considered. By reformulating the received signal from a tensor decomposition perspective, we develop two semi-blind receivers: a two-stage method transforming the fourth-order PARATUCK model into a third-order PARAFAC model, and a single-stage iterative process based on fourth-order TUCKER decomposition. Identifiability conditions for reliable joint recovery are derived, and numerical results demonstrate the performance advantages and trade-offs of the proposed schemes over existing solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CIoT networks face spectrum scarcity and vulnerability to jamming attacks, requiring adaptive solutions for secure and efficient spectrum sharing.

Method: Formulated optimization problem as model-free MDP, developed DDQN with UCB-IA variant for jamming navigation, using locally observable information without prior knowledge.

Result: Extensive simulations show proposed DRL algorithm with UCB-IA surpasses existing benchmarks, enabling adaptive, energy-efficient, and secure spectrum sharing.

Conclusion: The DRL framework provides effective autonomous management for CIoT devices under jamming attacks, improving throughput and network lifetime without requiring prior knowledge.

Abstract: In the evolving landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating cognitive radio (CR) has become a practical solution to address the challenge of spectrum scarcity, leading to the development of cognitive IoT (CIoT). However, the vulnerability of radio communications makes radio jamming attacks a key concern in CIoT networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach designed to optimize throughput and extend network lifetime of an energy-constrained CIoT system under jamming attacks. This DRL framework equips a CIoT device with the autonomy to manage energy harvesting (EH) and data transmission, while also regulating its transmit power to respect spectrum-sharing constraints. We formulate the optimization problem under various constraints, and we model the CIoT device's interactions within the channel as a model-free Markov decision process (MDP). The MDP serves as a foundation to develop a double deep Q-network (DDQN), designed to help the CIoT agent learn the optimal communication policy to navigate challenges such as dynamic channel occupancy, jamming attacks, and channel fading while achieving its goal. Additionally, we introduce a variant of the upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm, named UCB-IA, which enhances the CIoT network's ability to efficiently navigate jamming attacks within the channel. The proposed DRL algorithm does not rely on prior knowledge and uses locally observable information such as channel occupancy, jamming activity, channel gain, and energy arrival to make decisions. Extensive simulations prove that our proposed DRL algorithm that utilizes the UCB-IA strategy surpasses existing benchmarks, allowing for a more adaptive, energy-efficient, and secure spectrum sharing in CIoT networks.
