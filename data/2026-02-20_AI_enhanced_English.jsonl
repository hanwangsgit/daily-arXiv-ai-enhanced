Envelope detection accuracy improves with increasing the number of sampling points; however, we propose a novel transform that enables acceptable envelope extraction with significantly fewer sampling points, even without meeting the Nyquist rate. In this paper, we challenge the traditional scale definition and demonstrate that classic scaling lacks a physical referent in all situations. To achieve this aim, we introduce a scale based on the variations of space-invariant states, rather than the observable characteristics of matter and energy. According to this definition of the scale, we distinguished two kinds of observers: scale-variant and scale-invariant. We demonstrated that converting a scale-variant observer to a scale-invariant observer is equivalent to envelop extraction. To analyse and study the theories presented in the paper, we have designed and implemented an Earth-field NMR setup and used real data generated by it to evaluate the performance of the proposed envelope-detection transform.

Block verification (BV) was shown to be optimal over all verification algorithms which use only on-path probabilities, improving on standard speculative decoding. In this work, we first show that block verification is optimal even over verification algorithms that use off-path probabilities, by constructing an information-agnostic linear program (LP). Further, we can extend our LP to the setting where the draft model samples multiple candidate paths, and use it to construct a natural class of multi-path block verification generalizations.

We identify a key opportunity to overcome this bottleneck: unlike open-ended generation, OCR is a highly deterministic task where the visual input strictly dictates a unique output sequence, theoretically enabling efficient, parallel decoding via diffusion models. However, we show that existing masked diffusion models fail to harness this potential; those introduce structural instabilities that are benign in flexible tasks, like captioning, but catastrophic for the rigid, exact-match requirements of OCR.

We ask: is it possible to combine the blazing-fast speed of traditional standards with the superior visual fidelity of neural approaches? We present HybridPrompt, the first generative-based video system capable of achieving real-time 1080p decoding at over 150 FPS on a commercial smartphone.

The proposed operator employs a four-directional scanning strategy that naturally aligns with epipolar geometry while capturing vertical structural consistency, enabling efficient long-range spatial propagation within a single update step at linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we construct UW-StereoDepth-80K, a large-scale synthetic underwater stereo dataset featuring diverse baselines, attenuation coefficients, and scattering parameters through a two-stage generative pipeline combining semantic-aware style transfer and geometry-consistent novel view synthesis. Combined with dynamic LoRA adaptation inherited from StereoAdapter, our framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on underwater benchmarks with 17% improvement on TartanAir-UW and 7.2% improvment on SQUID, with real-world validation on the BlueROV2 platform demonstrates the robustness of our approach.

We introduce PETS (Principled and Efficient Test-TimeSelf-Consistency), which initiates a principled study of trajectory allocation through an optimization framework. Central to our approach is the self-consistency rate, a new measure defined as agreement with the infinite-budget majority vote. This formulation makes sample-efficient test-time allocation theoretically grounded and amenable to rigorous analysis. We study both offline and online settings. In the offline regime, where all questions are known in advance, we connect trajectory allocation to crowdsourcing, a classic and well-developed area, by modeling reasoning traces as workers. This perspective allows us to leverage rich existing theory, yielding theoretical guarantees and an efficient majority-voting-based allocation algorithm. In the online streaming regime, where questions arrive sequentially and allocations must be made on the fly, we propose a novel method inspired by the offline framework. Our approach adapts budgets to question difficulty while preserving strong theoretical guarantees and computational efficiency. Experiments show that PETS consistently outperforms uniform allocation.

We present a geometric analysis of optimization dynamics in transformers trained on modular arithmetic. PCA of attention weight trajectories reveals that training evolves predominantly within a low-dimensional execution subspace, with a single principal component capturing 68-83% of trajectory variance. To probe loss-landscape geometry, we measure commutator defects -- the non-commutativity of successive gradient steps -- and project them onto this learned subspace. We find that curvature grows sharply in directions orthogonal to the execution subspace while the trajectory remains largely confined to it. Importantly, curvature growth consistently precedes generalization across learning rates and hyperparameter regimes, with the lead time obeying a power law in the grokking timescale. Causal intervention experiments show that motion along the learned subspace is necessary for grokking, while artificially increasing curvature is insufficient. Together, these results support a geometric account in which grokking reflects escape from a metastable regime characterized by low-dimensional confinement and transverse curvature accumulation. All findings replicate across this learning-rate range, a qualitatively different slow regime (lr=5e-5, wd=0.1, 3 layers), and three random seeds, though alignment dynamics differ quantitatively between regimes.

This paper presents a purely proprioceptive state estimator that uses only IMU and motor measurements to jointly estimate body pose and velocity, with a unified formulation applicable to biped, quadruped, and wheel-legged robots. The key idea is to treat each contacting leg as a kinematic anchor: joint-torque--based foot wrench estimation selects reliable contacts, and the corresponding footfall positions provide intermittent world-frame constraints that suppress long-term drift. To prevent elevation drift during extended traversal, we introduce a lightweight height clustering and time-decay correction that snaps newly recorded footfall heights to previously observed support planes.

We focus on three types of guarantees: (1) *input domain robustness*, ensuring the circuit agrees with the model across a continuous input region; (2) *robust patching*, certifying circuit alignment under continuous patching perturbations; and (3) *minimality*, formalizing and capturing a wide array of various notions of succinctness. Interestingly, we uncover a diverse set of novel theoretical connections among these three families of guarantees, with critical implications for the convergence of our algorithms. Finally, we conduct experiments with state-of-the-art verifiers on various vision models, showing that our algorithms yield circuits with substantially stronger robustness guarantees than standard circuit discovery methods, establishing a principled foundation for provable circuit discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces automated circuit discovery algorithms with provable guarantees using neural network verification, focusing on input domain robustness, robust patching, and minimality.", "motivation": "Prior circuit discovery methods lack provable guarantees over continuous input domains, relying on heuristics or approximations.

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and its variants have achieved impressive rendering fidelity while maintaining high computational and memory efficiency. However, conventional vision-based GS pipelines typically rely on a sufficient number of camera views to initialize the Gaussian primitives and train their parameters, typically incurring additional processing cost during initialization while falling short in conditions where visual cues are unreliable, such as adverse weather, low illumination, or partial occlusions. To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures.

Although recent monocular non-rigid SLAM methods have made notable progress, they often lack effective decoupling mechanisms and rely on sparse or low-fidelity scene representations, which leads to tracking drift and limited reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, we propose NRGS-SLAM, a monocular non-rigid SLAM system for endoscopy based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. To resolve the coupling ambiguity, we introduce a deformation-aware 3D Gaussian map that augments each Gaussian primitive with a learnable deformation probability, optimized via a Bayesian self-supervision strategy without requiring external non-rigidity labels. Building on this representation, we design a deformable tracking module that performs robust coarse-to-fine pose estimation by prioritizing low-deformation regions, followed by efficient per-frame deformation updates. A carefully designed deformable mapping module progressively expands and refines the map, balancing representational capacity and computational efficiency. In addition, a unified robust geometric loss incorporates external geometric priors to mitigate the inherent ill-posedness of monocular non-rigid SLAM. Extensive experiments on multiple public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that NRGS-SLAM achieves more accurate camera pose estimation (up to 50\\% reduction in RMSE) and higher-quality photo-realistic reconstructions than state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into the retrieved context, we induce role confusion and cause the agent to misinterpret the injected content as legitimate user instructions or prior tool outputs. To enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, Phantom introduces a novel attack template search framework.

This lack of diversity not only restricts user choice, but also risks amplifying societal biases. In this work, we enhance the T2I diversity through a geometric lens. Unlike most existing methods that rely primarily on entropy-based guidance to increase sample dissimilarity, we introduce Geometry-Aware Spherical Sampling (GASS) to enhance diversity by explicitly controlling both prompt-dependent and prompt-independent sources of variation. Specifically, we decompose the diversity measure in CLIP embeddings using two orthogonal directions: the text embedding, which captures semantic variation related to the prompt, and an identified orthogonal direction that captures prompt-independent variation (e.g., backgrounds). Based on this decomposition, GASS increases the geometric projection spread of generated image embeddings along both axes and guides the T2I sampling process via expanded predictions along the generation trajectory.

Cinder first employs a rapid preliminary filter by comparing the \"non-outlier\" skill range of lobbies using the Ruzicka similarity index. Lobbies that pass this initial check are then evaluated using a more precise fairness metric. This second stage involves mapping player ranks to a non-linear set of skill buckets, generated from an inverted normal distribution, to provide higher granularity at average skill levels. The fairness of a potential match is then quantified using the Kantorovich distance on the lobbies' sorted bucket indices, producing a \"Sanction Score.\" We demonstrate the system's viability by analyzing the distribution of Sanction Scores from 140 million simulated lobby pairings, providing a robust foundation for fair matchmaking thresholds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Cinder is a two-stage matchmaking system for multiplayer games that uses Ruzicka similarity for fast filtering and Kantorovich distance on skill buckets for precise fairness evaluation.", "motivation": "Traditional matchmaking based on average team skill metrics often creates unbalanced games, especially with heterogeneous skill levels in pre-made teams (lobbies).

However, such challenges are now significantly overcome thanks to recent advances in deep learning, which provide pre-trained segmentation models capable of instantly delivering reliable, fine-grained anatomical delineations. We aim to demonstrate that these advances can be leveraged to create new anatomically-grounded image registration algorithms.

However, most existing methods are reactive: they detect anomalies only after they occur and lack the capability to provide proactive early warning signals. In this paper, we propose FATE (Forecasting Anomalies with Time-series Ensembles), a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Precursors-of-Anomaly (PoA) by quantifying predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on reconstruction errors or require ground-truth labels, FATE anticipates future values and leverages ensemble disagreement to signal early signs of potential anomalies without access to target values at inference time. To rigorously evaluate PoA detection, we introduce Precursor Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (PTaPR), a new metric that extends the traditional Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) by jointly assessing segment-level accuracy, within-segment coverage, and temporal promptness of early predictions. This enables a more holistic assessment of early warning capabilities that existing metrics overlook. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that FATE achieves an average improvement of 19.9 percentage points in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage points in early detection F1 score, outperforming baselines while requiring no anomaly labels.

In this work, the intrinsic representation properties learned during model pretraining are analyzed. It is demonstrated that semantic class concepts are entangled at the feature-pattern level, sharing associated features while preserving concept-specific discriminative components. This entanglement fundamentally limits the effectiveness of existing unlearning paradigms. Motivated by this insight, we propose Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU), a novel framework that guides unlearning through concept-aware re-alignment.

During finetuning, the negative noise suppresses target-specific feature patterns, while the positive noise reinforces remaining associated features and aligns them with perturbing concepts.

Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data. However, the use of two separate low-rank matrices in LoRA for federated fine-tuning introduces two types of challenges. The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound.

In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline.

Second, the computed parameters are either the hockey stick or Renyi divergence, both of which introduce overheads when used in privacy loss accounting.\n  In this work, we demonstrate that the privacy loss distribution (PLD) of random allocation applied to any differentially private algorithm can be computed efficiently. When applied to the Gaussian mechanism, our results demonstrate that the privacy-utility trade-off for random allocation is at least as good as that of Poisson subsampling. In particular, random allocation is better suited for training via DP-SGD. To support these computations, our work develops new tools for general privacy loss accounting based on a notion of PLD realization. This notion allows us to extend accurate privacy loss accounting to subsampling which previously required manual noise-mechanism-specific analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents an efficient method to compute the privacy loss distribution (PLD) for random allocation sampling, showing it matches or beats Poisson sampling for privacy-utility trade-offs, especially in DP-SGD training.", "motivation": "Random allocation sampling has been used in recent DP optimization and aggregation works but existing analyses have shortcomings: privacy parameters aren't tight due to approximations, and they use hockey stick or Renyi divergence which introduce overheads in privacy accounting.", "method": "Develops new tools for general privacy loss accounting based on PLD realization, enabling efficient computation of PLD for random allocation applied to any differentially private algorithm.

Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning (ML) models across clients without data centralization. Decentralized training, however, introduces a computational burden on client devices. U-shaped federated split learning (UFSL) offloads a fraction of the client computation to the server while keeping both data and labels on the clients' side. However, the intermediate representations (i.e., smashed data) shared by clients with the server are prone to exposing clients' private data. To reduce exposure of client data through intermediate data representations, this work proposes k-anonymous differentially private UFSL (KD-UFSL), which leverages privacy-enhancing techniques such as microaggregation and differential privacy to minimize data leakage from the smashed data transferred to the server. We first demonstrate that an adversary can access private client data from intermediate representations via a data-reconstruction attack, and then present a privacy-enhancing solution, KD-UFSL, to mitigate this risk. Our experiments indicate that, alongside increasing the mean squared error between the actual and reconstructed images by up to 50% in some cases, KD-UFSL also decreases the structural similarity between them by up to 40% on four benchmarking datasets.
