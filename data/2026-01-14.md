### [1] [Edge-AI Perception Node for Cooperative Road-Safety Enforcement and Connected-Vehicle Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07845)
*Shree Charran R,Rahul Kumar Dubey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time roadside AI system for autonomous traffic violation detection using YOLOv8 Nano, DeepSORT tracking, and OCR for license plate recognition, achieving 97.7% accuracy at 30 FPS on low-power edge hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address enforcement asymmetries in rapidly motorizing economies like India where 11M+ traffic violations occur annually against insufficient human policing density (1 officer per 4000 vehicles). Traditional surveillance can't scale to this magnitude.

Method: Edge AI perception node integrating YOLOv8 Nano for object detection, DeepSORT for vehicle tracking, and rule-guided OCR engine for multilingual license plate recognition compliant with MoRTH AIS 159/ISO 7591 standards. Deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Nano with TensorRT FP16 optimization.

Result: System achieves 28-30 FPS at 9.6W power, 97.7% violation detection accuracy, 84.9% OCR precision across 5 violation classes (signal jumping, zebra crossing breach, wrong way driving, illegal U-turn, speeding). Outperforms YOLOv4 Tiny, PP YOLOE S, and Nano DetPlus by 10.7% mAP with 1.4x accuracy per watt improvement.

Conclusion: Roadside edge AI analytics can autonomously detect traffic violations at scale and publish standardized safety events (CAM/DENM) via V2X protocols, enabling cooperative perception and proactive road safety management within intelligent transportation ecosystems.

Abstract: Rapid motorization in emerging economies such as India has created severe enforcement asymmetries, with over 11 million recorded violations in 2023 against a human policing density of roughly one officer per 4000 vehicles. Traditional surveillance and manual ticketing cannot scale to this magnitude, motivating the need for an autonomous, cooperative, and energy efficient edge AI perception infrastructure. This paper presents a real time roadside perception node for multi class traffic violation analytics and safety event dissemination within a connected and intelligent vehicle ecosystem. The node integrates YOLOv8 Nano for high accuracy multi object detection, DeepSORT for temporally consistent vehicle tracking, and a rule guided OCR post processing engine capable of recognizing degraded or multilingual license plates compliant with MoRTH AIS 159 and ISO 7591 visual contrast standards. Deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano with a 128 core Maxwell GPU and optimized via TensorRT FP16 quantization, the system sustains 28 to 30 frames per second inference at 9.6 W, achieving 97.7 percent violation detection accuracy and 84.9 percent OCR precision across five violation classes, namely signal jumping, zebra crossing breach, wrong way driving, illegal U turn, and speeding, without manual region of interest calibration. Comparative benchmarking against YOLOv4 Tiny, PP YOLOE S, and Nano DetPlus demonstrates a 10.7 percent mean average precision gain and a 1.4 times accuracy per watt improvement. Beyond enforcement, the node publishes standardized safety events of CAM and DENM type to connected vehicles and intelligent transportation system backends via V2X protocols, demonstrating that roadside edge AI analytics can augment cooperative perception and proactive road safety management within the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles ecosystem.

*Subeen Lee,Siyeong Lee,Namil Kim,Jaesik Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ROAD benchmark for evaluating LiDAR-based 3D object classification under simultaneous domain shifts and label evolution, revealing limitations of existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D perception systems need to adapt to evolving object definitions and sensor domains for real-world applications like autonomous driving, but continual and transfer learning in 3D point cloud perception remains underexplored compared to 2D vision, especially under simultaneous domain and label shifts.

Method: Proposed ROAD benchmark for LiDAR-based object classification that accounts for domain shifts and three forms of label evolution (class split, expansion, insertion). Evaluated zero-shot transfer, linear probe, and continual learning using large-scale datasets (Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse2), analyzing backbone architectures, training objectives, and CL methods.

Result: Findings reveal limitations of existing approaches under realistic shifts and establish strong baselines for future research in robust 3D perception.

Conclusion: The ROAD benchmark addresses a critical gap in 3D perception research by providing comprehensive evaluation under realistic domain and label shifts, highlighting the need for more robust approaches in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: For 3D perception systems to be practical in real-world applications -- from autonomous driving to embodied AI -- models must adapt to continuously evolving object definitions and sensor domains. Yet, research on continual and transfer learning in 3D point cloud perception remains underexplored compared to 2D vision -- particularly under simultaneous domain and label shifts. To address this gap, we propose the RObust Autonomous driving under Dataset shifts (ROAD) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation suite for LiDAR-based object classification that explicitly accounts for domain shifts as well as three key forms of label evolution: class split, class expansion, and class insertion. Using large-scale datasets (Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse2), we evaluate zero-shot transfer, linear probe, and CL, and analyze the impact of backbone architectures, training objectives, and CL methods. Our findings reveal limitations of existing approaches under realistic shifts and establish strong baselines for future research in robust 3D perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DGS-Drag is a point-based 3D editing framework that enables intuitive drag manipulation of real 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting and diffusion guidance for efficient geometry-related content editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While 3D content creation has advanced with generative models, intuitive drag editing with geometric changes has been successful in 2D editing but remains challenging for 3D scenes. There's a gap between deformation-based and 2D-editing-based 3D editing methods, particularly for geometry-related content editing.

*Fei Li,Lang Qiao,Jiahao Fan,Yijia Xu,Shawn M. Kaeppler,Zhou Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AKT transformer with PKAN modules improves maize localization in UAV imagery by addressing small object detection and computational efficiency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point-level maize localization in high-resolution UAV imagery faces three main challenges: extremely small object-to-pixel ratios (<0.1%), prohibitive computational costs of quadratic attention on ultra-high-resolution images (>3000x4000 pixels), and agricultural scene-specific complexities like sparse object distribution and environmental variability that general-purpose vision models handle poorly.

Method: Proposed Additive Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (AKT) replaces conventional multilayer perceptrons with Pade Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PKAN) modules to enhance functional expressivity for small-object feature extraction, and introduces PKAN Additive Attention (PAA) to model multiscale spatial dependencies with reduced computational complexity. Also created the Point-based Maize Localization (PML) dataset with 1,928 high-resolution UAV images and ~501,000 point annotations.

Result: AKT achieves average F1-score of 62.8%, outperforming SOTA by 4.2%, while reducing FLOPs by 12.6% and improving inference throughput by 20.7%. For downstream tasks: mean absolute error of 7.1 in stand counting, and root mean square error of 1.95-1.97 cm in interplant spacing estimation.

Conclusion: Integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theory with efficient attention mechanisms provides an effective framework for high-resolution agricultural remote sensing, addressing both accuracy and computational efficiency challenges in UAV-based crop monitoring.

Abstract: High-resolution UAV photogrammetry has become a key technology for precision agriculture, enabling centimeter-level crop monitoring and point-level plant localization. However, point-level maize localization in UAV imagery remains challenging due to (1) extremely small object-to-pixel ratios, typically less than 0.1%, (2) prohibitive computational costs of quadratic attention on ultra-high-resolution images larger than 3000 x 4000 pixels, and (3) agricultural scene-specific complexities such as sparse object distribution and environmental variability that are poorly handled by general-purpose vision models.
  To address these challenges, we propose the Additive Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (AKT), which replaces conventional multilayer perceptrons with Pade Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PKAN) modules to enhance functional expressivity for small-object feature extraction, and introduces PKAN Additive Attention (PAA) to model multiscale spatial dependencies with reduced computational complexity. In addition, we present the Point-based Maize Localization (PML) dataset, consisting of 1,928 high-resolution UAV images with approximately 501,000 point annotations collected under real field conditions.
  Extensive experiments show that AKT achieves an average F1-score of 62.8%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 4.2%, while reducing FLOPs by 12.6% and improving inference throughput by 20.7%. For downstream tasks, AKT attains a mean absolute error of 7.1 in stand counting and a root mean square error of 1.95-1.97 cm in interplant spacing estimation. These results demonstrate that integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theory with efficient attention mechanisms offers an effective framework for high-resolution agricultural remote sensing.

### [9] [Predicting Region of Interest in Human Visual Search Based on Statistical Texture and Gabor Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07998)
*Hongwei Lin,Diego Andrade,Mini Das,Howard C. Gifford*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combining Gabor and GLCM texture features improves modeling of early-stage visual search behavior in medical imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and model human visual search behavior in location-unknown search tasks, particularly for medical imaging applications like breast cancer detection, by investigating how different visual features contribute to early-stage attention allocation.

Method: Proposed two feature-combination pipelines integrating Gabor-based features (structural) and GLCM-based texture features. Evaluated using simulated digital breast tomosynthesis images, comparing predictions with threshold-based model observer and eye-tracking data from human observers.

Result: Qualitative agreement between predicted fixation candidates and model observer, strong correlation between GLCM mean and Gabor feature responses, and consistency between predicted fixation regions and early-stage human gaze behavior from eye-tracking data.

Conclusion: Combining structural (Gabor) and texture-based (GLCM) features is valuable for modeling visual search behavior, supporting development of perceptually informed observer models for medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Understanding human visual search behavior is a fundamental problem in vision science and computer vision, with direct implications for modeling how observers allocate attention in location-unknown search tasks. In this study, we investigate the relationship between Gabor-based features and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture features in modeling early-stage visual search behavior. Two feature-combination pipelines are proposed to integrate Gabor and GLCM features for narrowing the region of possible human fixations. The pipelines are evaluated using simulated digital breast tomosynthesis images. Results show qualitative agreement among fixation candidates predicted by the proposed pipelines and a threshold-based model observer. A strong correlation is observed between GLCM mean and Gabor feature responses, indicating that these features encode related image information despite their different formulations. Eye-tracking data from human observers further suggest consistency between predicted fixation regions and early-stage gaze behavior. These findings highlight the value of combining structural and texture-based features for modeling visual search and support the development of perceptually informed observer models.

### [10] [CASHEW: Stabilizing Multimodal Reasoning via Iterative Trajectory Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08010)
*Chaoyu Li,Deeparghya Dutta Barua,Fei Tao,Pooyan Fazli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CASHEW and CASHEW-RL improve vision-language model reasoning stability through test-time aggregation and reinforcement learning with visual verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models show strong performance but have unstable multi-step reasoning with divergent trajectories and inconsistent predictions across repeated sampling.

Method: Two approaches: (1) CASHEW - inference-time framework that aggregates multiple reasoning trajectories with visual verification to filter hallucinations; (2) CASHEW-RL - learned variant trained with Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) using composite reward for correct answers grounded in minimal visual evidence.

Result: Significant performance improvements on 13 benchmarks including +23.6pp on ScienceQA and +8.1pp on EgoSchema.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches effectively stabilize vision-language model reasoning through aggregation mechanisms and reinforcement learning, achieving substantial gains across diverse multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models achieve strong performance across a wide range of multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks, yet their multi-step reasoning remains unstable. Repeated sampling over the same input often produces divergent reasoning trajectories and inconsistent final predictions. To address this, we introduce two complementary approaches inspired by test-time scaling: (1) CASHEW, an inference-time framework that stabilizes reasoning by iteratively aggregating multiple candidate trajectories into higher-quality reasoning traces, with explicit visual verification filtering hallucinated steps and grounding reasoning in visual evidence, and (2) CASHEW-RL, a learned variant that internalizes this aggregation behavior within a single model. CASHEW-RL is trained using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) with a composite reward that encourages correct answers grounded in minimal yet sufficient visual evidence, while adaptively allocating reasoning effort based on task difficulty. This training objective enables robust self-aggregation at inference. Extensive experiments on 13 image understanding, video understanding, and video reasoning benchmarks show significant performance improvements, including gains of up to +23.6 percentage points on ScienceQA and +8.1 percentage points on EgoSchema.

### [11] [Zero-Shot Distracted Driver Detection via Vision Language Models with Double Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08467)
*Takamichi Miyata,Sumiko Miyata,Andrew Morris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A subject decoupling framework for distracted driver detection that separates driver appearance from behavior cues using appearance embeddings and Stiefel manifold projection to improve zero-shot classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distracted driving causes traffic collisions, but existing VLM-based detectors underperform due to entangling subject-specific appearance variations (clothing, age, gender) with behavior cues, leading to decisions based on who the driver is rather than what they're doing.

Method: Proposes a subject decoupling framework that extracts driver appearance embeddings and removes their influence from image embeddings before zero-shot classification. Also orthogonalizes text embeddings via metric projection onto Stiefel manifold to improve separability while preserving original semantics.

Result: Experiments demonstrate consistent gains over prior baselines, showing improved performance for distracted driver detection in real-world conditions.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for practical road-safety applications by addressing the key bottleneck of subject-specific appearance variations in VLM-based distracted driver detection.

Abstract: Distracted driving is a major cause of traffic collisions, calling for robust and scalable detection methods. Vision-language models (VLMs) enable strong zero-shot image classification, but existing VLM-based distracted driver detectors often underperform in real-world conditions. We identify subject-specific appearance variations (e.g., clothing, age, and gender) as a key bottleneck: VLMs entangle these factors with behavior cues, leading to decisions driven by who the driver is rather than what the driver is doing. To address this, we propose a subject decoupling framework that extracts a driver appearance embedding and removes its influence from the image embedding prior to zero-shot classification, thereby emphasizing distraction-relevant evidence. We further orthogonalize text embeddings via metric projection onto Stiefel manifold to improve separability while staying close to the original semantics. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains over prior baselines, indicating the promise of our approach for practical road-safety applications.

### [12] [TP-Blend: Textual-Prompt Attention Pairing for Precise Object-Style Blending in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08011)
*Xin Jin,Yichuan Zhong,Yapeng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TP-Blend is a training-free framework for simultaneous object replacement and style transfer in diffusion models using two separate prompts and attention-based fusion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion editors handle single object replacement well but struggle when both a new object and new style need to be introduced simultaneously, requiring a solution for combined content and appearance control.

Method: TP-Blend uses two complementary attention processors: Cross-Attention Object Fusion (CAOF) for object replacement via optimal transport-based feature reassignment, and Self-Attention Style Fusion (SASF) for style injection through Detail-Sensitive Instance Normalization and Key/Value matrix swapping.

Result: Extensive experiments show TP-Blend produces high-resolution, photo-realistic edits with precise control over both content and appearance, surpassing recent baselines in quantitative fidelity, perceptual quality, and inference speed.

Conclusion: TP-Blend provides an effective training-free solution for simultaneous object replacement and style transfer in diffusion models, offering improved control and performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Current text-conditioned diffusion editors handle single object replacement well but struggle when a new object and a new style must be introduced simultaneously. We present Twin-Prompt Attention Blend (TP-Blend), a lightweight training-free framework that receives two separate textual prompts, one specifying a blend object and the other defining a target style, and injects both into a single denoising trajectory. TP-Blend is driven by two complementary attention processors. Cross-Attention Object Fusion (CAOF) first averages head-wise attention to locate spatial tokens that respond strongly to either prompt, then solves an entropy-regularised optimal transport problem that reassigns complete multi-head feature vectors to those positions. CAOF updates feature vectors at the full combined dimensionality of all heads (e.g., 640 dimensions in SD-XL), preserving rich cross-head correlations while keeping memory low. Self-Attention Style Fusion (SASF) injects style at every self-attention layer through Detail-Sensitive Instance Normalization. A lightweight one-dimensional Gaussian filter separates low- and high-frequency components; only the high-frequency residual is blended back, imprinting brush-stroke-level texture without disrupting global geometry. SASF further swaps the Key and Value matrices with those derived from the style prompt, enforcing context-aware texture modulation that remains independent of object fusion. Extensive experiments show that TP-Blend produces high-resolution, photo-realistic edits with precise control over both content and appearance, surpassing recent baselines in quantitative fidelity, perceptual quality, and inference speed.

### [14] [Representations of Text and Images Align From Layer One](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08017)
*Evžen Wybitul,Javier Rando,Florian Tramèr,Stanislav Fort*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper shows that image-text alignment in adapter-based vision-language models occurs from the first layer, not just late layers, using a DeepDream-inspired synthesis method to visualize concept representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the established view that image-text alignment only appears in late layers of vision-language models, and to provide direct evidence of alignment at early layers on a concept-by-concept basis.

Method: A synthesis-based method inspired by DeepDream: extract concept vectors for textual concepts at specific layers, then use optimization to synthesize images whose representations align with those vectors. Applied to hundreds of concepts across seven layers in Gemma 3.

Result: Synthesized images often depict salient visual features of targeted textual concepts from layer 1 onward (e.g., >50% of images show recognizable features of animals, activities, or seasons at layer 1). Provides direct constructive evidence of early image-text alignment.

Conclusion: Image-text alignment in adapter-based vision-language models occurs from the first layer, contradicting previous assumptions. The method offers a simple, fast approach for measuring multimodal alignment without auxiliary models/datasets, and provides new interpretability tools for visualizing model representations.

Abstract: We show that for a variety of concepts in adapter-based vision-language models, the representations of their images and their text descriptions are meaningfully aligned from the very first layer. This contradicts the established view that such image-text alignment only appears in late layers. We show this using a new synthesis-based method inspired by DeepDream: given a textual concept such as "Jupiter", we extract its concept vector at a given layer, and then use optimisation to synthesise an image whose representation aligns with that vector. We apply our approach to hundreds of concepts across seven layers in Gemma 3, and find that the synthesised images often depict salient visual features of the targeted textual concepts: for example, already at layer 1, more than 50 % of images depict recognisable features of animals, activities, or seasons. Our method thus provides direct, constructive evidence of image-text alignment on a concept-by-concept and layer-by-layer basis. Unlike previous methods for measuring multimodal alignment, our approach is simple, fast, and does not require auxiliary models or datasets. It also offers a new path towards model interpretability, by providing a way to visualise a model's representation space by backtracing through its image processing components.

### [15] [Training Free Zero-Shot Visual Anomaly Localization via Diffusion Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08022)
*Samet Hicsonmez,Abd El Rahman Shabayek,Djamila Aouada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free vision-only zero-shot anomaly detection method using DDIM inversion to reconstruct normal images and detect anomalies from reconstruction discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot anomaly detection methods either rely on auxiliary modalities like language for fine-grained prompts, or vision-only methods are limited to image-level classification without spatial precision for localization.

Method: Uses DDIM inversion to obtain latent representations from input images, then initiates denoising from a fixed intermediate timestep to reconstruct normal-looking images. The discrepancy between input and reconstruction highlights anomalies.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on VISA dataset with strong localization capabilities, outperforming methods that require auxiliary modalities.

Conclusion: Proposes an effective training-free vision-only framework that eliminates dependence on fine-grained prompts and auxiliary modalities for zero-shot anomaly detection.

Abstract: Zero-Shot image Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) aims to detect and localise anomalies without access to any normal training samples of the target data. While recent ZSAD approaches leverage additional modalities such as language to generate fine-grained prompts for localisation, vision-only methods remain limited to image-level classification, lacking spatial precision. In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective training-free vision-only ZSAD framework that circumvents the need for fine-grained prompts by leveraging the inversion of a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). Specifically, given an input image and a generic text description (e.g., "an image of an [object class]"), we invert the image to obtain latent representations and initiate the denoising process from a fixed intermediate timestep to reconstruct the image. Since the underlying diffusion model is trained solely on normal data, this process yields a normal-looking reconstruction. The discrepancy between the input image and the reconstructed one highlights potential anomalies. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VISA dataset, demonstrating strong localisation capabilities without auxiliary modalities and facilitating a shift away from prompt dependence for zero-shot anomaly detection research.

*Amin Abbasishahkoo,Mahboubeh Dadkhah,Lionel Briand*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBD (Concept-Based Diversity) is a new efficient diversity metric using Vision-Language Models for image input selection, combined with uncertainty sampling to outperform existing methods while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeling new data for DNN fine-tuning is expensive and time-consuming. Existing diversity-based selection methods are effective but computationally intensive and not scalable for large datasets.

Method: Proposed Concept-Based Diversity (CBD) metric leveraging Vision-Language Models for efficient diversity measurement. Combined CBD with Margin (uncertainty metric) in a hybrid selection approach.

Result: CBD strongly correlates with established Geometric Diversity but is much faster. CBD-based selection consistently outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines across diverse models and datasets, while maintaining efficiency close to simple uncertainty methods.

Conclusion: CBD-based approach provides effective, computationally efficient, and scalable solution for input selection in DNN fine-tuning, particularly valuable for repetitive and large-scale selection scenarios.

Abstract: Maintaining or improving the performance of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) through fine-tuning requires labeling newly collected inputs, a process that is often costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this problem, input selection approaches have been developed in recent years to identify small, yet highly informative subsets for labeling. Diversity-based selection is one of the most effective approaches for this purpose. However, they are often computationally intensive and lack scalability for large input sets, limiting their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we introduce Concept-Based Diversity (CBD), a highly efficient metric for image inputs that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLM). Our results show that CBD exhibits a strong correlation with Geometric Diversity (GD), an established diversity metric, while requiring only a fraction of its computation time. Building on this finding, we propose a hybrid input selection approach that combines CBD with Margin, a simple uncertainty metric. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of DNN models, input sets, selection budgets, and five most effective state-of-the-art selection baselines. The results demonstrate that the CBD-based selection consistently outperforms all baselines at guiding input selection to improve the DNN model. Furthermore, the CBD-based selection approach remains highly efficient, requiring selection times close to those of simple uncertainty-based methods such as Margin, even on larger input sets like ImageNet. These results confirm not only the effectiveness and computational advantage of the CBD-based approach, particularly compared to hybrid baselines, but also its scalability in repetitive and extensive input selection scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific compound figures combine multiple panels but captions are often missing or only provide figure-level summaries, making panel-level understanding difficult in real pipelines.

Method: Proposes FigEx2 with noise-aware gated fusion module to filter token-level features, and staged optimization combining supervised learning with RL using CLIP-based alignment and BERTScore rewards for multimodal consistency.

Result: Achieves 0.726 mAP@0.5:0.95 for detection, outperforms Qwen3-VL-8B by 0.51 in METEOR and 0.24 in BERTScore, and shows remarkable zero-shot transferability to out-of-distribution scientific domains.

Conclusion: FigEx2 effectively addresses panel-level understanding in scientific compound figures with strong detection and captioning performance, plus excellent cross-domain transferability without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Scientific compound figures combine multiple labeled panels into a single image, but captions in real pipelines are often missing or only provide figure-level summaries, making panel-level understanding difficult. In this paper, we propose FigEx2, visual-conditioned framework that localizes panels and generates panel-wise captions directly from the compound figure. To mitigate the impact of diverse phrasing in open-ended captioning, we introduce a noise-aware gated fusion module that adaptively filters token-level features to stabilize the detection query space. Furthermore, we employ a staged optimization strategy combining supervised learning with reinforcement learning (RL), utilizing CLIP-based alignment and BERTScore-based semantic rewards to enforce strict multimodal consistency. To support high-quality supervision, we curate BioSci-Fig-Cap, a refined benchmark for panel-level grounding, alongside cross-disciplinary test suites in physics and chemistry. Experimental results demonstrate that FigEx2 achieves a superior 0.726 mAP@0.5:0.95 for detection and significantly outperforms Qwen3-VL-8B by 0.51 in METEOR and 0.24 in BERTScore. Notably, FigEx2 exhibits remarkable zero-shot transferability to out-of-distribution scientific domains without any fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed vision-language guided framework effectively addresses the unique challenges of biomedical forgery detection and generation, providing a comprehensive solution for scientific integrity verification in biomedical publications.

Abstract: Scientific image manipulation in biomedical publications poses a growing threat to research integrity and reproducibility. Unlike natural image forensics, biomedical forgery detection is uniquely challenging due to domain-specific artifacts, complex textures, and unstructured figure layouts. We present the first vision-language guided framework for both generating and detecting biomedical image forgeries. By combining diffusion-based synthesis with vision-language prompting, our method enables realistic and semantically controlled manipulations, including duplication, splicing, and region removal, across diverse biomedical modalities. We introduce Rescind, a large-scale benchmark featuring fine-grained annotations and modality-specific splits, and propose Integscan, a structured state space modeling framework that integrates attention-enhanced visual encoding with prompt-conditioned semantic alignment for precise forgery localization. To ensure semantic fidelity, we incorporate a vision-language model based verification loop that filters generated forgeries based on consistency with intended prompts. Extensive experiments on Rescind and existing benchmarks demonstrate that Integscan achieves state of the art performance in both detection and localization, establishing a strong foundation for automated scientific integrity analysis.

*Oscar H. Ramírez-Agudelo,Nicoleta Gorea,Aliza Reif,Lorenzo Bonasera,Michael Karl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training CNNs with 10% noisy data improves robustness to corrupted test data while maintaining clean-data performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world image data often contains noise and distortions, but models are typically trained on clean data, creating a robustness gap. The paper investigates whether controlled noise exposure during training can improve model resilience to corrupted inputs.

Method: Used CIFAR-10 dataset with Resnet-18 model, introduced three types of noise (Gaussian noise, Salt-and-Pepper noise, Gaussian blur) at varying intensities and training set pollution levels (0-100%). Evaluated impact on test performance under both clean and fully corrupted conditions.

Result: Incorporating just 10% noisy data during training significantly reduces test loss and improves accuracy on fully corrupted test data, with minimal negative impact on clean-data performance. The approach acts as an effective regularizer.

Conclusion: Strategic exposure to noise during training offers a practical trade-off between traditional data cleanliness and real-world resilience, serving as a simple yet effective regularization technique for improving CNN robustness to corrupted inputs.

Abstract: Data quality plays a central role in the performance and robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification. While high-quality data is often preferred for training, real-world inputs are frequently affected by noise and other distortions. This paper investigates the effect of deliberately introducing controlled noise into the training data to improve model robustness. Using the CIFAR-10 dataset, we evaluate the impact of three common corruptions, namely Gaussian noise, Salt-and-Pepper noise, and Gaussian blur at varying intensities and training set pollution levels. Experiments using a Resnet-18 model reveal that incorporating just 10\% noisy data during training is sufficient to significantly reduce test loss and enhance accuracy under fully corrupted test conditions, with minimal impact on clean-data performance. These findings suggest that strategic exposure to noise can act as a simple yet effective regularizer, offering a practical trade-off between traditional data cleanliness and real-world resilience.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot medical image segmentation is challenging due to limited annotated data. While self-supervised foundation models like DINOv3 show promise for feature extraction, their direct application to medical images is hindered by domain differences between natural and medical images.

Method: Proposes DINO-AugSeg with two key modules: 1) WT-Aug - wavelet-based feature-level augmentation that perturbs frequency components to enrich DINOv3-extracted feature diversity, and 2) CG-Fuse - contextual information-guided fusion module using cross-attention to integrate semantic-rich low-resolution features with spatially detailed high-resolution features.

Result: Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks across five imaging modalities (MRI, CT, ultrasound, endoscopy, dermoscopy) show DINO-AugSeg consistently outperforms existing methods under limited-sample conditions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses domain differences through wavelet-domain augmentation and contextual fusion, demonstrating robust feature representation for few-shot medical image segmentation. DINO-AugSeg represents a promising direction for advancing this field.

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic medical image segmentation plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning but remains challenging in few-shot scenarios due to the scarcity of annotated training data. Recently, self-supervised foundation models such as DINOv3, which were trained on large natural image datasets, have shown strong potential for dense feature extraction that can help with the few-shot learning challenge. Yet, their direct application to medical images is hindered by domain differences. In this work, we propose DINO-AugSeg, a novel framework that leverages DINOv3 features to address the few-shot medical image segmentation challenge. Specifically, we introduce WT-Aug, a wavelet-based feature-level augmentation module that enriches the diversity of DINOv3-extracted features by perturbing frequency components, and CG-Fuse, a contextual information-guided fusion module that exploits cross-attention to integrate semantic-rich low-resolution features with spatially detailed high-resolution features. Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks spanning five imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, endoscopy, and dermoscopy, demonstrate that DINO-AugSeg consistently outperforms existing methods under limited-sample conditions. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating wavelet-domain augmentation and contextual fusion for robust feature representation, suggesting DINO-AugSeg as a promising direction for advancing few-shot medical image segmentation.

*Mohamad Koohi-Moghadam,Mohammad-Ali Nikouei Mahani,Kyongtae Tyler Bae*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathoGen is a diffusion-based model for generating realistic histopathology lesions via inpainting to address data scarcity in medical AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Histopathology AI models suffer from scarce expert-annotated lesion data, especially for rare pathologies. Existing data augmentation methods fail to generate realistic lesion morphologies with proper tissue structures.

Method: PathoGen uses diffusion-based generative modeling for controllable, high-fidelity inpainting of lesions into benign histopathology images. It leverages iterative refinement to synthesize lesions with natural boundaries, preserved cellular structures, and authentic staining characteristics.

Result: PathoGen outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines (conditional GAN and Stable Diffusion) in image fidelity and distributional similarity across four diverse datasets (kidney, skin, breast, prostate). Augmenting training sets with PathoGen-synthesized lesions enhances downstream segmentation performance, especially in data-scarce regimes.

Conclusion: PathoGen provides a scalable solution to overcome manual annotation bottlenecks in medical AI by generating both realistic morphology and pixel-level ground truth, enabling development of generalizable systems despite limited expert-labeled data.

Abstract: The development of robust artificial intelligence models for histopathology diagnosis is severely constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated lesion data, particularly for rare pathologies and underrepresented disease subtypes. While data augmentation offers a potential solution, existing methods fail to generate sufficiently realistic lesion morphologies that preserve the complex spatial relationships and cellular architectures characteristic of histopathological tissues. Here we present PathoGen, a diffusion-based generative model that enables controllable, high-fidelity inpainting of lesions into benign histopathology images. Unlike conventional augmentation techniques, PathoGen leverages the iterative refinement process of diffusion models to synthesize lesions with natural tissue boundaries, preserved cellular structures, and authentic staining characteristics. We validate PathoGen across four diverse datasets representing distinct diagnostic challenges: kidney, skin, breast, and prostate pathology. Quantitative assessment confirms that PathoGen outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines, including conditional GAN and Stable Diffusion, in image fidelity and distributional similarity. Crucially, we show that augmenting training sets with PathoGen-synthesized lesions enhances downstream segmentation performance compared to traditional geometric augmentations, particularly in data-scarce regimes. Besides, by simultaneously generating realistic morphology and pixel-level ground truth, PathoGen effectively overcomes the manual annotation bottleneck. This approach offers a scalable pathway for developing generalizable medical AI systems despite limited expert-labeled data.

### [23] [How Do Optical Flow and Textual Prompts Collaborate to Assist in Audio-Visual Semantic Segmentation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08133)
*Peng Gao,Yujian Lee,Yongqi Xu,Wentao Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSP introduces a collaborative framework using optical flow and textual prompts for audio-visual semantic segmentation, outperforming existing methods by better handling both moving and stationary sound-emitting objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio-visual semantic segmentation requires deeper semantic understanding beyond just identifying sound-emitting objects. Previous methods decomposed the task into two subtasks, but there's a need for better handling of both moving objects (using temporal context) and stationary sound-emitting objects.

Method: SSP framework integrates optical flow and textual prompts with a pre-mask technique for motion dynamics and a visual-textual alignment module. It uses two textual prompts: one for object category and one for scene description. Training includes a post-mask technique to learn optical flow patterns.

Result: SSP outperforms existing audio-visual segmentation methods, delivering more efficient and precise segmentation results.

Conclusion: The SSP framework successfully addresses challenges in audio-visual semantic segmentation by leveraging optical flow for temporal context and textual prompts for semantic understanding, providing a robust solution for both moving and stationary sound-emitting objects.

Abstract: Audio-visual semantic segmentation (AVSS) represents an extension of the audio-visual segmentation (AVS) task, necessitating a semantic understanding of audio-visual scenes beyond merely identifying sound-emitting objects at the visual pixel level. Contrary to a previous methodology, by decomposing the AVSS task into two discrete subtasks by initially providing a prompted segmentation mask to facilitate subsequent semantic analysis, our approach innovates on this foundational strategy. We introduce a novel collaborative framework, \textit{S}tepping \textit{S}tone \textit{P}lus (SSP), which integrates optical flow and textual prompts to assist the segmentation process. In scenarios where sound sources frequently coexist with moving objects, our pre-mask technique leverages optical flow to capture motion dynamics, providing essential temporal context for precise segmentation. To address the challenge posed by stationary sound-emitting objects, such as alarm clocks, SSP incorporates two specific textual prompts: one identifies the category of the sound-emitting object, and the other provides a broader description of the scene. Additionally, we implement a visual-textual alignment module (VTA) to facilitate cross-modal integration, delivering more coherent and contextually relevant semantic interpretations. Our training regimen involves a post-mask technique aimed at compelling the model to learn the diagram of the optical flow. Experimental results demonstrate that SSP outperforms existing AVS methods, delivering efficient and precise segmentation results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SubTTA improves vision-language model adaptation to distribution shifts by aligning semantic subspaces between visual and textual modalities to enhance pseudo-label quality for test-time adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptation methods for vision-language models rely on unreliable zero-shot predictions as pseudo-labels due to modality gaps and visual nuisance under distribution shifts, which misguide adaptation.

Method: SubTTA aligns semantic subspaces by extracting principal subspaces of both modalities, aligning visual manifold to textual semantic anchor via chordal distance minimization, and projecting aligned visual features onto task-specific textual subspace to filter noise before standard TTA.

Result: Extensive experiments show SubTTA achieves average 2.24% improvement over state-of-the-art TTA methods across various benchmarks and VLM architectures.

Conclusion: SubTTA effectively addresses modality gap and visual nuisance limitations by semantic subspace alignment, enabling more reliable pseudo-labels and better test-time adaptation for vision-language models under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), despite their extraordinary zero-shot capabilities, are vulnerable to distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) emerges as a predominant strategy to adapt VLMs to unlabeled test data on the fly. However, existing TTA methods heavily rely on zero-shot predictions as pseudo-labels for self-training, which can be unreliable under distribution shifts and misguide adaptation due to two fundamental limitations. First (Modality Gap), distribution shifts induce gaps between visual and textual modalities, making cross-modal relations inaccurate. Second (Visual Nuisance), visual embeddings encode rich but task-irrelevant noise that often overwhelms task-specific semantics under distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose SubTTA, which aligns the semantic subspaces of both modalities to enhance zero-shot predictions to better guide the TTA process. To bridge the modality gap, SubTTA extracts the principal subspaces of both modalities and aligns the visual manifold to the textual semantic anchor by minimizing their chordal distance. To eliminate visual nuisance, SubTTA projects the aligned visual features onto the task-specific textual subspace, which filters out task-irrelevant noise by constraining visual embeddings within the valid semantic span, and standard TTA is further performed on the purified space to refine the decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and VLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of SubTTA, yielding an average improvement of 2.24% over state-of-the-art TTA methods.

TL;DR: Systematic analysis reveals MLLMs fuse vision-language info at specific layers, not uniformly, with late-stage visual reactivation. High attention noise persists on irrelevant regions while text-aligned attention increases. Proposed training-free contrastive attention framework improves multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite remarkable progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), there's poor understanding of how they internally integrate visual and textual information. The authors aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the internal fusion mechanisms.

Method: Performed systematic layer-wise masking analysis across multiple MLLM architectures to study visual-text fusion evolution. Analyzed layer-wise attention evolution patterns. Introduced a training-free contrastive attention framework that models transformation between early fusion and final layers to highlight meaningful attention shifts.

Result: Revealed that fusion emerges at specific layers rather than being uniformly distributed. Certain models exhibit late-stage "review" phenomenon where visual signals are reactivated before output generation. Found persistent high-attention noise on irrelevant regions and gradually increasing attention on text-aligned areas. Proposed framework improves multimodal reasoning performance across various MLLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The systematic analysis provides insights into how MLLMs integrate multimodal information, revealing specific fusion patterns and attention behaviors. The proposed training-free contrastive attention framework effectively leverages these insights to enhance multimodal reasoning without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language understanding, yet how they internally integrate visual and textual information remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we perform a systematic layer-wise masking analysis across multiple architectures, revealing how visual-text fusion evolves within MLLMs. The results show that fusion emerges at several specific layers rather than being uniformly distributed across the network, and certain models exhibit a late-stage "review" phenomenon where visual signals are reactivated before output generation. Besides, we further analyze layer-wise attention evolution and observe persistent high-attention noise on irrelevant regions, along with gradually increasing attention on text-aligned areas. Guided by these insights, we introduce a training-free contrastive attention framework that models the transformation between early fusion and final layers to highlight meaningful attention shifts. Extensive experiments across various MLLMs and benchmarks validate our analysis and demonstrate that the proposed approach improves multimodal reasoning performance. Code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explainable VAD methods lack spatial grounding, making explanations unverifiable, especially in multi-entity interactions where they often produce incomplete or visually misaligned descriptions that reduce trustworthiness.

Method: Proposes instance-aligned captions that link each textual claim to specific object instances with appearance and motion attributes, capturing who caused the anomaly, what each entity was doing, whom it affected, and where explanations are grounded.

Result: Created VIEW360+ dataset by annotating eight VAD benchmarks and extending VIEW360 with 868 additional videos, eight locations, and four new anomaly types. Experiments show instance-level spatially grounded captions reveal limitations in current LLM- and VLM-based methods.

Conclusion: The framework enables verifiable and actionable reasoning for explainable VAD, providing a robust benchmark for future research in trustworthy and interpretable anomaly detection.

Abstract: Explainable video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for safety-critical applications, yet even with recent progress, much of the research still lacks spatial grounding, making the explanations unverifiable. This limitation is especially pronounced in multi-entity interactions, where existing explainable VAD methods often produce incomplete or visually misaligned descriptions, reducing their trustworthiness. To address these challenges, we introduce instance-aligned captions that link each textual claim to specific object instances with appearance and motion attributes. Our framework captures who caused the anomaly, what each entity was doing, whom it affected, and where the explanationis grounded, enabling verifiable and actionable reasoning. We annotate eight widely used VAD benchmarks and extend the 360-degree egocentric dataset, VIEW360, with 868 additional videos, eight locations, and four new anomaly types, creating VIEW360+, a comprehensive testbed for explainable VAD. Experiments show that our instance-level spatially grounded captions reveal significant limitations in current LLM- and VLM-based methods while providing a robust benchmark for future research in trustworthy and interpretable anomaly detection.

TL;DR: Hardware-algorithm co-design framework using custom SVE sensor and physics-aware dehazing to enable optical measurement of rocket launch mechanical parameters under extreme imaging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme rocket launch conditions (dense particulate haze, 120+ dB luminance variations) degrade image data, preventing accurate optical measurement of critical mechanical parameters like plume flow fields, shock waves, and nozzle oscillations needed for quantitative aerospace analysis.

Method: Co-design framework combining custom Spatially Varying Exposure (SVE) sensor that captures multi-exposure data in single shot with physics-aware dehazing algorithm that dynamically estimates haze density, performs region-adaptive illumination optimization, and applies multi-scale entropy-constrained fusion to separate haze from scene radiance.

Result: Superior performance in recovering physically accurate visual information of plume and engine region from real launch imagery and controlled experiments, enabling reliable extraction of key mechanical parameters including particle velocity, flow instability frequency, and structural vibration.

Conclusion: The proposed hardware-algorithm co-design framework provides a reliable image basis for precise quantitative analysis in extreme aerospace environments, overcoming severe imaging challenges of rocket launches to support mechanical parameter extraction.

Abstract: Quantitative optical measurement of critical mechanical parameters -- such as plume flow fields, shock wave structures, and nozzle oscillations -- during rocket launch faces severe challenges due to extreme imaging conditions. Intense combustion creates dense particulate haze and luminance variations exceeding 120 dB, degrading image data and undermining subsequent photogrammetric and velocimetric analyses. To address these issues, we propose a hardware-algorithm co-design framework that combines a custom Spatially Varying Exposure (SVE) sensor with a physics-aware dehazing algorithm. The SVE sensor acquires multi-exposure data in a single shot, enabling robust haze assessment without relying on idealized atmospheric models. Our approach dynamically estimates haze density, performs region-adaptive illumination optimization, and applies multi-scale entropy-constrained fusion to effectively separate haze from scene radiance. Validated on real launch imagery and controlled experiments, the framework demonstrates superior performance in recovering physically accurate visual information of the plume and engine region. This offers a reliable image basis for extracting key mechanical parameters, including particle velocity, flow instability frequency, and structural vibration, thereby supporting precise quantitative analysis in extreme aerospace environments.

TL;DR: SISTA: A multi-level alignment framework for medical VLP that addresses false negatives in contrastive learning by incorporating inter-report similarity and aligning image patches with relevant word tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional medical VLP treats all unpaired image-report samples as negatives, but medical datasets often have substantial similarities between different patients' data. This rigid approach disrupts semantic structure and harms representation quality.

Method: Proposes SISTA framework with two-level alignment: 1) Image-report level: improves contrastive learning by incorporating inter-report similarity to eliminate false negatives; 2) Patch-word level: aligns image patches with relevant word tokens for fine-grained correspondence.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across different datasets on three downstream tasks: image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. Achieves significant improvements in fine-grained tasks even with limited labeled data.

Conclusion: SISTA framework addresses limitations of traditional medical VLP by better handling semantic similarities in medical data through multi-level alignment, leading to improved transfer performance and fine-grained task capabilities.

Abstract: Medical contrastive vision-language pre-training (VLP) has demonstrated significant potential in improving performance on downstream tasks. Traditional approaches typically employ contrastive learning, treating paired image-report samples as positives and unpaired ones as negatives. However, in medical datasets, there can be substantial similarities between images or reports from different patients. Rigidly treating all unpaired samples as negatives, can disrupt the underlying semantic structure and negatively impact the quality of the learned representations. In this paper, we propose a multi-level alignment framework, Representation Learning with Semantic-aware Instance and Sparse Token Alignments (SISTA) by exploiting the semantic correspondence between medical image and radiology reports at two levels, i.e., image-report and patch-word levels. Specifically, we improve the conventional contrastive learning by incorporating inter-report similarity to eliminate the false negatives and introduce a method to effectively align image patches with relevant word tokens. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving transfer performance across different datasets on three downstream tasks: image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. Notably, our framework achieves significant improvements in fine-grained tasks even with limited labeled data. Codes and pre-trained models will be made available.

TL;DR: A lightweight multimodal task platform for UAVs that integrates BLIP-2 with YOLO models for real-time visual understanding without task-specific fine-tuning on drone data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the contradiction between high computational cost of large Vision Language Models and limited computing resources on UAV edge devices for real-time visual understanding in complex scenarios.

Method: 1) Integrate BLIP-2 with YOLO-World and YOLOv8-Seg models for object detection and instance segmentation; 2) Content-aware key frame sampling using K-Means clustering with intelligent frame selection and temporal feature concatenation; 3) Unified prompt optimization scheme injecting structured YOLO event logs as context with output constraints.

Result: Enables lightweight BLIP-2 architecture to handle video-level interactive tasks effectively for UAV applications with minimal adaptation and no task-specific fine-tuning on drone data.

Conclusion: Proposed platform extends multi-task capabilities of BLIP-2 for UAV applications by leveraging YOLO's precise perception, intelligent frame sampling, and optimized prompting, making real-time visual understanding feasible on resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: The demand for real-time visual understanding and interaction in complex scenarios is increasingly critical for unmanned aerial vehicles. However, a significant challenge arises from the contradiction between the high computational cost of large Vision language models and the limited computing resources available on UAV edge devices. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a lightweight multimodal task platform based on BLIP-2, integrated with YOLO-World and YOLOv8-Seg models. This integration extends the multi-task capabilities of BLIP-2 for UAV applications with minimal adaptation and without requiring task-specific fine-tuning on drone data. Firstly, the deep integration of BLIP-2 with YOLO models enables it to leverage the precise perceptual results of YOLO for fundamental tasks like object detection and instance segmentation, thereby facilitating deeper visual-attention understanding and reasoning. Secondly, a content-aware key frame sampling mechanism based on K-Means clustering is designed, which incorporates intelligent frame selection and temporal feature concatenation. This equips the lightweight BLIP-2 architecture with the capability to handle video-level interactive tasks effectively. Thirdly, a unified prompt optimization scheme for multi-task adaptation is implemented. This scheme strategically injects structured event logs from the YOLO models as contextual information into BLIP-2's input. Combined with output constraints designed to filter out technical details, this approach effectively guides the model to generate accurate and contextually relevant outputs for various tasks.

TL;DR: Motive is a motion attribution framework for video generation that identifies which training clips influence motion quality, enabling data curation that improves temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid progress in video generation, there's poor understanding of how training data influences motion quality. Current methods focus on visual appearance rather than temporal dynamics.

Method: Motive uses gradient-based data attribution with motion-weighted loss masks to isolate temporal dynamics from static appearance, enabling efficient computation of motion-specific influence scores for training clips.

Result: Motive identifies high-influence clips that improve motion quality. Using Motive-selected data improves motion smoothness and dynamic degree on VBench, achieving 74.1% human preference win rate over base model.

Conclusion: Motive is the first framework to attribute motion rather than visual appearance in video generation, enabling data curation that significantly improves temporal consistency and physical plausibility.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of video generation models, the role of data in influencing motion is poorly understood. We present Motive (MOTIon attribution for Video gEneration), a motion-centric, gradient-based data attribution framework that scales to modern, large, high-quality video datasets and models. We use this to study which fine-tuning clips improve or degrade temporal dynamics. Motive isolates temporal dynamics from static appearance via motion-weighted loss masks, yielding efficient and scalable motion-specific influence computation. On text-to-video models, Motive identifies clips that strongly affect motion and guides data curation that improves temporal consistency and physical plausibility. With Motive-selected high-influence data, our method improves both motion smoothness and dynamic degree on VBench, achieving a 74.1% human preference win rate compared with the pretrained base model. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to attribute motion rather than visual appearance in video generative models and to use it to curate fine-tuning data.

Motivation: To develop a 3D scene understanding system that mimics human cognitive abilities - maintaining persistent memory of static scenes, recognizing dynamic objects, and efficiently handling revisits to familiar locations for continuous scene understanding.

Method: Three core components: 1) Multi-stage motion cue framework for dynamic object identification using depth and camera pose priors, 2) Cognitive mapping system for storing, recalling, and updating static scenes in a memory bank, 3) Factor graph optimization for refining camera poses.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on video depth estimation, camera pose reconstruction, and 3D mapping tasks, with effective support for continuous scene understanding across extended sequences and multiple visits.

Conclusion: CogniMap3D successfully demonstrates bioinspired cognitive approaches to dynamic 3D scene understanding, enabling persistent memory storage, efficient scene retrieval, and robust performance across various 3D reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: We present CogniMap3D, a bioinspired framework for dynamic 3D scene understanding and reconstruction that emulates human cognitive processes. Our approach maintains a persistent memory bank of static scenes, enabling efficient spatial knowledge storage and rapid retrieval. CogniMap3D integrates three core capabilities: a multi-stage motion cue framework for identifying dynamic objects, a cognitive mapping system for storing, recalling, and updating static scenes across multiple visits, and a factor graph optimization strategy for refining camera poses. Given an image stream, our model identifies dynamic regions through motion cues with depth and camera pose priors, then matches static elements against its memory bank. When revisiting familiar locations, CogniMap3D retrieves stored scenes, relocates cameras, and updates memory with new observations. Evaluations on video depth estimation, camera pose reconstruction, and 3D mapping tasks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance, while effectively supporting continuous scene understanding across extended sequences and multiple visits.

*Anh H. Vo,Tae-Seok Kim,Hulin Jin,Soo-Mi Choi,Yong-Guk Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for generating 3D facial expression transitions driven by text instructions, enabling smooth transitions between arbitrary expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D avatars typically have limited cardinal facial expressions; realistic emotional variation requires smooth transitions between arbitrary expressions driven by natural language instructions.

Method: Proposes IFED module for multimodal learning of text-expression correlations, I2FET method with vertex reconstruction loss for semantic comprehension, and Facial Expression Transition model for smooth expression sequences.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CK+ and CelebV-HQ datasets, generating realistic facial expression trajectories according to text instructions.

Conclusion: Text-driven approach greatly expands facial expression repertoire and transitions, enabling diverse emotional state descriptions with practical applications in avatar animation.

Abstract: A 3D avatar typically has one of six cardinal facial expressions. To simulate realistic emotional variation, we should be able to render a facial transition between two arbitrary expressions. This study presents a new framework for instruction-driven facial expression generation that produces a 3D face and, starting from an image of the face, transforms the facial expression from one designated facial expression to another. The Instruction-driven Facial Expression Decomposer (IFED) module is introduced to facilitate multimodal data learning and capture the correlation between textual descriptions and facial expression features. Subsequently, we propose the Instruction to Facial Expression Transition (I2FET) method, which leverages IFED and a vertex reconstruction loss function to refine the semantic comprehension of latent vectors, thus generating a facial expression sequence according to the given instruction. Lastly, we present the Facial Expression Transition model to generate smooth transitions between facial expressions. Extensive evaluation suggests that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the CK+ and CelebV-HQ datasets. The results show that our framework can generate facial expression trajectories according to text instruction. Considering that text prompts allow us to make diverse descriptions of human emotional states, the repertoire of facial expressions and the transitions between them can be expanded greatly. We expect our framework to find various practical applications More information about our project can be found at https://vohoanganh.github.io/tg3dfet/

### [34] [Second-order Gaussian directional derivative representations for image high-resolution corner detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08182)
*Dongbo Xie,Junjie Qiu,Changming Sun,Weichuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new high-resolution corner detection method using second-order Gaussian directional derivative filtering to address issues with existing corner models, particularly for detecting adjacent corners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing corner detection methods have theoretical flaws when dealing with adjacent corners, as the grayscale information of two adjacent corners can affect each other. Zhang et al.'s simple corner model fails to accurately characterize high-resolution corners.

Method: Uses second-order Gaussian directional derivative (SOGDD) filter to smooth two high-resolution corner models (END-type and L-type). Derives SOGDD representations for these models, discovers corner characteristics, and develops a method to select Gaussian filtering scales to extract intensity variation information for accurate adjacent corner detection.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization error, robustness to image blur transformation, image matching, and 3D reconstruction. It can accurately detect adjacent corner points that previous methods struggled with.

Conclusion: The SOGDD-based high-resolution corner detection method successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches, particularly for adjacent corner detection, and demonstrates superior performance across multiple computer vision applications.

Abstract: Corner detection is widely used in various computer vision tasks, such as image matching and 3D reconstruction. Our research indicates that there are theoretical flaws in Zhang et al.'s use of a simple corner model to obtain a series of corner characteristics, as the grayscale information of two adjacent corners can affect each other. In order to address the above issues, a second-order Gaussian directional derivative (SOGDD) filter is used in this work to smooth two typical high-resolution angle models (i.e. END-type and L-type models). Then, the SOGDD representations of these two corner models were derived separately, and many characteristics of high-resolution corners were discovered, which enabled us to demonstrate how to select Gaussian filtering scales to obtain intensity variation information from images, accurately depicting adjacent corners. In addition, a new high-resolution corner detection method for images has been proposed for the first time, which can accurately detect adjacent corner points. The experimental results have verified that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of localization error, robustness to image blur transformation, image matching, and 3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: MLLMs show promise in gastroenterology but have spatial grounding limitations and fluency-accuracy trade-offs compared to human endoscopists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate MLLMs across comprehensive gastrointestinal endoscopy workflows and compare their clinical utility against human benchmarks.

Method: Created GI-Bench with 20 lesion categories, evaluated 12 MLLMs across 5-stage clinical workflow (localization, identification, diagnosis, description, management), benchmarked against 6 human endoscopists using Macro-F1, mIoU, and Likert scales.

Result: Gemini-3-Pro achieved SOTA; top models outperformed trainees in diagnostic reasoning (Macro-F1 0.641 vs 0.492) and rivaled junior endoscopists (0.727). However, humans significantly outperformed models in lesion localization (mIoU >0.506 vs 0.345). Models showed "fluency-accuracy paradox" - better readability but lower factual correctness due to hallucinations.

Conclusion: MLLMs show clinical potential but face critical spatial grounding bottlenecks and fluency-accuracy trade-offs; GI-Bench provides ongoing evaluation framework with dynamic leaderboard.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise in gastroenterology, yet their performance against comprehensive clinical workflows and human benchmarks remains unverified. To systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs across a panoramic gastrointestinal endoscopy workflow and determine their clinical utility compared with human endoscopists. We constructed GI-Bench, a benchmark encompassing 20 fine-grained lesion categories. Twelve MLLMs were evaluated across a five-stage clinical workflow: anatomical localization, lesion identification, diagnosis, findings description, and management. Model performance was benchmarked against three junior endoscopists and three residency trainees using Macro-F1, mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), and multi-dimensional Likert scale. Gemini-3-Pro achieved state-of-the-art performance. In diagnostic reasoning, top-tier models (Macro-F1 0.641) outperformed trainees (0.492) and rivaled junior endoscopists (0.727; p>0.05). However, a critical "spatial grounding bottleneck" persisted; human lesion localization (mIoU >0.506) significantly outperformed the best model (0.345; p<0.05). Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed a "fluency-accuracy paradox": models generated reports with superior linguistic readability compared with humans (p<0.05) but exhibited significantly lower factual correctness (p<0.05) due to "over-interpretation" and hallucination of visual features.GI-Bench maintains a dynamic leaderboard that tracks the evolving performance of MLLMs in clinical endoscopy.

### [36] [Human-inspired Global-to-Parallel Multi-scale Encoding for Lightweight Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08190)
*Wei Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPM (Global-to-Parallel Multi-scale Encoding) is a lightweight vision architecture inspired by human visual perception that balances parameter scale, computation, and performance through global-to-local processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight models either sacrifice performance for computation reduction or increase parameters significantly, while human vision-inspired approaches oversimplify visual processing. Need for balanced accuracy-efficiency trade-off that better mimics human perception.

Method: GPM architecture with Global Insight Generator (GIG) for holistic cues, followed by parallel branches: LSAE for mid/large-scale semantic relations and IRB for fine-grained texture preservation. This mimics human vision's whole-before-details and contextual awareness principles.

Result: H-GPE network built on GPM achieves strong performance on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation while maintaining balanced FLOPs and parameters, outperforming recent SOTA lightweight models in accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

Conclusion: GPM's biologically-inspired global-to-parallel multi-scale encoding provides an effective lightweight vision solution that balances computational efficiency, parameter count, and task performance, offering better deployment potential on resource-limited devices.

Abstract: Lightweight vision networks have witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, yet achieving a satisfactory balance among parameter scale, computational overhead, and task performance remains difficult. Although many existing lightweight models manage to reduce computation considerably, they often do so at the expense of a substantial increase in parameter count (e.g., LSNet, MobileMamba), which still poses obstacles for deployment on resource-limited devices. In parallel, some studies attempt to draw inspiration from human visual perception, but their modeling tends to oversimplify the visual process, making it hard to reflect how perception truly operates. Revisiting the cooperative mechanism of the human visual system, we propose GPM (Global-to-Parallel Multi-scale Encoding). GPM first employs a Global Insight Generator (GIG) to extract holistic cues, and subsequently processes features of different scales through parallel branches: LSAE emphasizes mid-/large-scale semantic relations, while IRB (Inverted Residual Block) preserves fine-grained texture information, jointly enabling coherent representation of global and local features. As such, GPM conforms to two characteristic behaviors of human vision perceiving the whole before focusing on details, and maintaining broad contextual awareness even during local attention. Built upon GPM, we further develop the lightweight H-GPE network. Experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation show that H-GPE achieves strong performance while maintaining a balanced footprint in both FLOPs and parameters, delivering a more favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared with recent state-of-the-art lightweight models.

TL;DR: R^4 is an agentic framework that decomposes medical imaging workflows into four coordinated agents (Router, Retriever, Reflector, Repairer) to improve reasoning, safety, and spatial grounding in chest X-ray analysis without gradient-based fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image analysis systems using large vision-language models are mostly single-pass black boxes with limited control over reasoning, safety, and spatial grounding, necessitating a more structured and controllable approach.

Method: The R^4 framework uses four coordinated agents: Router configures task-aware prompts, Retriever generates reports and bounding boxes using exemplar memory, Reflector critiques for clinical error modes, and Repairer iteratively revises outputs while curating exemplars.

Result: R^4 consistently boosts LLM-as-a-Judge scores by +1.7-+2.5 points and mAP50 by +2.5-+3.5 absolute points over strong single-VLM baselines on chest X-ray analysis without any gradient-based fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Agentic routing, reflection, and repair can transform strong but brittle vision-language models into more reliable and better grounded tools for clinical image interpretation.

Abstract: Medical image analysis increasingly relies on large vision-language models (VLMs), yet most systems remain single-pass black boxes that offer limited control over reasoning, safety, and spatial grounding. We propose R^4, an agentic framework that decomposes medical imaging workflows into four coordinated agents: a Router that configures task- and specialization-aware prompts from the image, patient history, and metadata; a Retriever that uses exemplar memory and pass@k sampling to jointly generate free-text reports and bounding boxes; a Reflector that critiques each draft-box pair for key clinical error modes (negation, laterality, unsupported claims, contradictions, missing findings, and localization errors); and a Repairer that iteratively revises both narrative and spatial outputs under targeted constraints while curating high-quality exemplars for future cases. Instantiated on chest X-ray analysis with multiple modern VLM backbones and evaluated on report generation and weakly supervised detection, R^4 consistently boosts LLM-as-a-Judge scores by roughly +1.7-+2.5 points and mAP50 by +2.5-+3.5 absolute points over strong single-VLM baselines, without any gradient-based fine-tuning. These results show that agentic routing, reflection, and repair can turn strong but brittle VLMs into more reliable and better grounded tools for clinical image interpretation.

TL;DR: MMH is a unified framework for multi-site multi-sequence brain MRI harmonization that uses diffusion models and biomedical semantic priors to disentangle style from anatomy without requiring paired data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-site brain MRI data aggregation introduces non-biological heterogeneity from site-specific variations (scanner vendors, acquisition parameters, protocols) that undermine model generalizability. Existing methods rely on limited paired data, fail to disentangle style from anatomy, and only handle single sequences, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Diffusion-based global harmonizer maps MR images to sequence-specific unified domain using style-agnostic gradient conditioning; (2) Target-specific fine-tuner adapts globally aligned images to desired target domains. Uses tri-planar attention BiomedCLIP encoder to aggregate multi-view embeddings for volumetric style characterization, enabling explicit style-anatomy disentanglement without paired data.

Result: Evaluated on 4,163 T1- and T2-weighted MRIs, MMH demonstrates superior harmonization over state-of-the-art methods in image feature clustering, voxel-level comparison, tissue segmentation, and downstream age and site classification tasks.

Conclusion: MMH provides an effective solution for multi-site multi-sequence MRI harmonization by leveraging biomedical semantic priors and diffusion models to address key limitations of existing approaches, enabling better data aggregation and improved model generalizability in real-world clinical settings.

Abstract: Aggregating multi-site brain MRI data can enhance deep learning model training, but also introduces non-biological heterogeneity caused by site-specific variations (e.g., differences in scanner vendors, acquisition parameters, and imaging protocols) that can undermine generalizability. Recent retrospective MRI harmonization seeks to reduce such site effects by standardizing image style (e.g., intensity, contrast, noise patterns) while preserving anatomical content. However, existing methods often rely on limited paired traveling-subject data or fail to effectively disentangle style from anatomy. Furthermore, most current approaches address only single-sequence harmonization, restricting their use in real-world settings where multi-sequence MRI is routinely acquired. To this end, we introduce MMH, a unified framework for multi-site multi-sequence brain MRI harmonization that leverages biomedical semantic priors for sequence-aware style alignment. MMH operates in two stages: (1) a diffusion-based global harmonizer that maps MR images to a sequence-specific unified domain using style-agnostic gradient conditioning, and (2) a target-specific fine-tuner that adapts globally aligned images to desired target domains. A tri-planar attention BiomedCLIP encoder aggregates multi-view embeddings to characterize volumetric style information, allowing explicit disentanglement of image styles from anatomy without requiring paired data. Evaluations on 4,163 T1- and T2-weighted MRIs demonstrate MMH's superior harmonization over state-of-the-art methods in image feature clustering, voxel-level comparison, tissue segmentation, and downstream age and site classification.

TL;DR: MobiDiary generates natural language descriptions of daily activities from IMU and Wi-Fi signals, using a unified sensor encoder and Transformer decoder to bridge physical signals with human-readable summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based HAR systems face privacy concerns and environmental limitations like occlusion. There's a need for systems that can generate expressive, human-readable activity descriptions from physical signals rather than just pre-defined labels.

Method: Proposes MobiDiary framework with unified sensor encoder that captures shared inductive biases of motion-induced signals (IMU and Wi-Fi). Uses patch-based mechanism for local temporal correlations and heterogeneous placement embedding to unify spatial contexts. Transformer-based decoder with autoregressive mechanism generates coherent descriptions word-by-word.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public benchmarks (XRF V2, UWash, WiFiTAD) for captioning metrics (BLEU@4, CIDEr, RMC). Effectively generalizes across modalities and outperforms specialized baselines in continuous action understanding.

Conclusion: MobiDiary successfully bridges the semantic gap between noisy physical signals and natural language descriptions, offering privacy-preserving, expressive activity recognition that generalizes well across different sensor modalities.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) in smart homes is critical for health monitoring and assistive living. While vision-based systems are common, they face privacy concerns and environmental limitations (e.g., occlusion). In this work, we present MobiDiary, a framework that generates natural language descriptions of daily activities directly from heterogeneous physical signals (specifically IMU and Wi-Fi). Unlike conventional approaches that restrict outputs to pre-defined labels, MobiDiary produces expressive, human-readable summaries. To bridge the semantic gap between continuous, noisy physical signals and discrete linguistic descriptions, we propose a unified sensor encoder. Instead of relying on modality-specific engineering, we exploit the shared inductive biases of motion-induced signals--where both inertial and wireless data reflect underlying kinematic dynamics. Specifically, our encoder utilizes a patch-based mechanism to capture local temporal correlations and integrates heterogeneous placement embedding to unify spatial contexts across different sensors. These unified signal tokens are then fed into a Transformer-based decoder, which employs an autoregressive mechanism to generate coherent action descriptions word-by-word. We comprehensively evaluate our approach on multiple public benchmarks (XRF V2, UWash, and WiFiTAD). Experimental results demonstrate that MobiDiary effectively generalizes across modalities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on captioning metrics (e.g., BLEU@4, CIDEr, RMC) and outperforming specialized baselines in continuous action understanding.

Conclusion: The work establishes feasibility of gas emission-based livestock health monitoring and paves the way for practical, in vitro acidosis detection systems, with CO2 identified as the primary discriminative signal.

Abstract: Ruminal acidosis is a prevalent metabolic disorder in dairy cattle causing significant economic losses and animal welfare concerns. Current diagnostic methods rely on invasive pH measurement, limiting scalability for continuous monitoring. We present FUME (Fused Unified Multi-gas Emission Network), the first deep learning approach for rumen acidosis detection from dual-gas optical imaging under in vitro conditions. Our method leverages complementary carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emission patterns captured by infrared cameras to classify rumen health into Healthy, Transitional, and Acidotic states. FUME employs a lightweight dual-stream architecture with weight-shared encoders, modality-specific self-attention, and channel attention fusion, jointly optimizing gas plume segmentation and classification of dairy cattle health. We introduce the first dual-gas OGI dataset comprising 8,967 annotated frames across six pH levels with pixel-level segmentation masks. Experiments demonstrate that FUME achieves 80.99% mIoU and 98.82% classification accuracy while using only 1.28M parameters and 1.97G MACs--outperforming state-of-the-art methods in segmentation quality with 10x lower computational cost. Ablation studies reveal that CO2 provides the primary discriminative signal and dual-task learning is essential for optimal performance.

*Michele Fiori,Gabriele Civitarese,Marco Colussi,Claudio Bettini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot ADL recognition using LLMs with event-based segmentation outperforms time-based approaches and supervised methods, plus a new confidence estimation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot LLM approaches for ADL recognition rely on time-based segmentation that doesn't align well with LLMs' contextual reasoning capabilities, and they lack methods for estimating prediction confidence.

Method: Proposes event-based segmentation (instead of time-based) for better alignment with LLM reasoning, and introduces a novel method for estimating prediction confidence in zero-shot ADL recognition.

Result: Event-based segmentation consistently outperforms time-based LLM approaches on complex datasets and surpasses supervised data-driven methods, even with relatively small LLMs. The confidence measure effectively distinguishes correct from incorrect predictions.

Conclusion: Event-based segmentation improves zero-shot ADL recognition by better leveraging LLMs' contextual reasoning, and the proposed confidence estimation method provides reliable prediction uncertainty measures.

Abstract: Unobtrusive sensor-based recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in smart homes by processing data collected from IoT sensing devices supports applications such as healthcare, safety, and energy management. Recent zero-shot methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have the advantage of removing the reliance on labeled ADL sensor data. However, existing approaches rely on time-based segmentation, which is poorly aligned with the contextual reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Moreover, existing approaches lack methods for estimating prediction confidence. This paper proposes to improve zero-shot ADL recognition with event-based segmentation and a novel method for estimating prediction confidence. Our experimental evaluation shows that event-based segmentation consistently outperforms time-based LLM approaches on complex, realistic datasets and surpasses supervised data-driven methods, even with relatively small LLMs (e.g., Gemma 3 27B). The proposed confidence measure effectively distinguishes correct from incorrect predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of standardized datasets has hindered progress in automatic intrapulse modulation classification (AIMC), which is critical for radar signal analysis in electronic support systems, especially under noisy conditions.

Method: Created AIMC-Spec dataset with 33 modulation types across 13 SNR levels for spectrogram-based image classification. Re-implemented and evaluated 5 deep learning algorithms (lightweight CNNs, denoising architectures, transformer-based networks) under unified input format.

Result: Significant performance variation across algorithms, with frequency-modulated (FM) signals classified more reliably than phase or hybrid types, especially at low SNRs. FM-only tests revealed how modulation type and network architecture influence classifier robustness.

Conclusion: AIMC-Spec establishes a reproducible baseline and provides foundation for future research and standardization in the AIMC domain, enabling progress in radar signal analysis under degraded conditions.

Abstract: A lack of standardized datasets has long hindered progress in automatic intrapulse modulation classification (AIMC) - a critical task in radar signal analysis for electronic support systems, particularly under noisy or degraded conditions. AIMC seeks to identify the modulation type embedded within a single radar pulse from its complex in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) representation, enabling automated interpretation of intrapulse structure. This paper introduces AIMC-Spec, a comprehensive synthetic dataset for spectrogram-based image classification, encompassing 33 modulation types across 13 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. To benchmark AIMC-Spec, five representative deep learning algorithms - ranging from lightweight CNNs and denoising architectures to transformer-based networks - were re-implemented and evaluated under a unified input format. The results reveal significant performance variation, with frequency-modulated (FM) signals classified more reliably than phase or hybrid types, particularly at low SNRs. A focused FM-only test further highlights how modulation type and network architecture influence classifier robustness. AIMC-Spec establishes a reproducible baseline and provides a foundation for future research and standardization in the AIMC domain.

*Qitan Lv,Tianyu Liu,Wen Wu,Xuenan Xu,Bowen Zhou,Feng Wu,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HIPPO: A holistic-aware parallel speculative decoding framework for video-LLMs that achieves up to 3.51x speedup through semantic-aware token preservation and parallel draft generation/verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding methods for video-LLMs fail to achieve inference acceleration comparable to text-only LLMs due to inadequate preservation of visual semantic tokens (degrading draft quality) and remaining high inference costs even with aggressive pruning.

Method: HIPPO proposes: 1) Semantic-aware token preservation that fuses global attention scores with local visual semantics to retain semantic information at high pruning ratios; 2) Video parallel speculative decoding algorithm that decouples and overlaps draft generation and target verification phases.

Result: Experiments on four video-LLMs across six benchmarks demonstrate HIPPO's effectiveness, yielding up to 3.51x speedup compared to vanilla auto-regressive decoding.

Conclusion: HIPPO addresses key limitations in video-LLM speculative decoding by preserving semantic information while enabling parallel processing, achieving significant inference acceleration without sacrificing output quality.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate LLM inference without sacrificing output quality. Existing SD methods tailored for video-LLMs primarily focus on pruning redundant visual tokens to mitigate the computational burden of massive visual inputs. However, existing methods do not achieve inference acceleration comparable to text-only LLMs. We observe from extensive experiments that this phenomenon mainly stems from two limitations: (i) their pruning strategies inadequately preserve visual semantic tokens, degrading draft quality and acceptance rates; (ii) even with aggressive pruning (e.g., 90% visual tokens removed), the draft model's remaining inference cost limits overall speedup. To address these limitations, we propose HIPPO, a general holistic-aware parallel speculative decoding framework. Specifically, HIPPO proposes (i) a semantic-aware token preservation method, which fuses global attention scores with local visual semantics to retain semantic information at high pruning ratios; (ii) a video parallel SD algorithm that decouples and overlaps draft generation and target verification phases. Experiments on four video-LLMs across six benchmarks demonstrate HIPPO's effectiveness, yielding up to 3.51x speedup compared to vanilla auto-regressive decoding.

*Janis Mohr,Jörg Frochte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Capsule networks with siamese architecture and stacked images achieve strong one-shot learning performance across industrial and face recognition tasks, outperforming other methods while being easy to optimize.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs require large datasets and computational resources, which is problematic for one-shot learning where only limited data is available. The paper addresses the challenge of making accurate predictions after seeing only one example per class.

Method: Uses siamese capsule networks with stacked images for one-shot identification tasks. The approach combines capsule architecture with siamese networks to learn effective representations from minimal data.

Result: The capsule-based approach achieves strong results and exceeds other techniques on a wide range of datasets, from industrial applications to face recognition benchmarks.

Conclusion: Capsule networks with siamese architecture provide an effective, easy-to-use solution for one-shot learning that outperforms existing methods across diverse domains while being straightforward to optimize.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in the computer vision community, significantly improving the state-of-the-art. But learning good features often is computationally expensive in machine learning settings and is especially difficult when there is a lack of data. One-shot learning is one such area where only limited data is available. In one-shot learning, predictions have to be made after seeing only one example from one class, which requires special techniques. In this paper we explore different approaches to one-shot identification tasks in different domains including an industrial application and face recognition. We use a special technique with stacked images and use siamese capsule networks. It is encouraging to see that the approach using capsule architecture achieves strong results and exceeds other techniques on a wide range of datasets from industrial application to face recognition benchmarks while being easy to use and optimise.

*Xianfeng Wang,Kaiwei Zhang,Qi Jia,Zijian Chen,Guangtao Zhai,Xiongkuo Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs lack fundamental visual primitives that 6-7 year old children possess, as shown by the KidVis benchmark evaluating six atomic visual capabilities where humans score 95.32 vs GPT-5's 67.33, revealing a "Scaling Law Paradox" where parameter scaling doesn't improve these basic visual skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Multimodal Large Language Models possess fundamental visual primitives comparable to human intuition, despite their demonstrated proficiency in high-level reasoning tasks like complex diagrammatic interpretation.

Method: Introduce KidVis benchmark grounded in human visual development theory, deconstructing visual intelligence into six atomic capabilities (Concentration, Tracking, Discrimination, Memory, Spatial, and Closure) that 6-7 year old children possess. Evaluate 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs against human physiological baseline using 10 categories of low-semantic-dependent visual tasks.

Result: Human children achieve near-perfect average score of 95.32, while state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 67.33. Reveals "Scaling Law Paradox" - increasing model parameters fails to yield linear improvements in foundational visual capabilities.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs lack essential physiological perceptual primitives required for generalized visual intelligence, despite their reasoning prowess. Their visual capabilities lag significantly behind those of young children in fundamental visual processing tasks.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive proficiency in high-level reasoning tasks, such as complex diagrammatic interpretation, it remains an open question whether they possess the fundamental visual primitives comparable to human intuition. To investigate this, we introduce KidVis, a novel benchmark grounded in the theory of human visual development. KidVis deconstructs visual intelligence into six atomic capabilities - Concentration, Tracking, Discrimination, Memory, Spatial, and Closure - already possessed by 6-7 year old children, comprising 10 categories of low-semantic-dependent visual tasks. Evaluating 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs against a human physiological baseline reveals a stark performance disparity. Results indicate that while human children achieve a near-perfect average score of 95.32, the state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 67.33. Crucially, we observe a "Scaling Law Paradox": simply increasing model parameters fails to yield linear improvements in these foundational visual capabilities. This study confirms that current MLLMs, despite their reasoning prowess, lack the essential physiological perceptual primitives required for generalized visual intelligence.

TL;DR: M3SR: A multi-scale, multi-perceptual Mamba architecture for hyperspectral image reconstruction that addresses spatial perception limitations and single-scale feature extraction challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mamba architectures for spectral reconstruction face two key challenges: (1) single spatial perception limits comprehensive understanding of hyperspectral images, and (2) single-scale feature extraction struggles to capture complex structures and fine details in hyperspectral data.

Method: Proposes M3SR with a multi-perceptual fusion block integrated into a U-Net structure. This enables extraction and fusion of global, intermediate, and local features at multiple scales for accurate hyperspectral reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments show M3SR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods while maintaining lower computational cost.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-scale, multi-perceptual Mamba architecture effectively addresses limitations in current spectral reconstruction approaches, achieving superior performance with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: The Mamba architecture has been widely applied to various low-level vision tasks due to its exceptional adaptability and strong performance. Although the Mamba architecture has been adopted for spectral reconstruction, it still faces the following two challenges: (1) Single spatial perception limits the ability to fully understand and analyze hyperspectral images; (2) Single-scale feature extraction struggles to capture the complex structures and fine details present in hyperspectral images. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale, multi-perceptual Mamba architecture for the spectral reconstruction task, called M3SR. Specifically, we design a multi-perceptual fusion block to enhance the ability of the model to comprehensively understand and analyze the input features. By integrating the multi-perceptual fusion block into a U-Net structure, M3SR can effectively extract and fuse global, intermediate, and local features, thereby enabling accurate reconstruction of hyperspectral images at multiple scales. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed M3SR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods while incurring a lower computational cost.

Motivation: State-of-the-art 3D medical segmentation models are too large for clinics with limited computing resources, while lightweight architectures suffer significant performance loss. There's a need for efficient models that maintain accuracy for clinical deployment.

Method: Proposes Region- and Context-aware Knowledge Distillation (ReCo-KD) with two components: 1) Multi-Scale Structure-Aware Region Distillation (MS-SARD) using class-aware masks and scale-normalized weighting to emphasize small clinically important regions, and 2) Multi-Scale Context Alignment (MS-CA) aligning teacher-student affinity patterns across feature levels. Implemented on nnU-Net in a backbone-agnostic manner.

Result: Distilled lightweight models achieve accuracy close to teacher models while significantly reducing parameters and inference latency across multiple public 3D medical segmentation datasets and a challenging aggregated dataset.

Conclusion: ReCo-KD provides a practical training-only framework for clinical deployment of efficient 3D medical segmentation models without requiring custom student design, maintaining accuracy while reducing computational requirements.

Abstract: Accurate 3D medical image segmentation is vital for diagnosis and treatment planning, but state-of-the-art models are often too large for clinics with limited computing resources. Lightweight architectures typically suffer significant performance loss. To address these deployment and speed constraints, we propose Region- and Context-aware Knowledge Distillation (ReCo-KD), a training-only framework that transfers both fine-grained anatomical detail and long-range contextual information from a high-capacity teacher to a compact student network. The framework integrates Multi-Scale Structure-Aware Region Distillation (MS-SARD), which applies class-aware masks and scale-normalized weighting to emphasize small but clinically important regions, and Multi-Scale Context Alignment (MS-CA), which aligns teacher-student affinity patterns across feature levels. Implemented on nnU-Net in a backbone-agnostic manner, ReCo-KD requires no custom student design and is easily adapted to other architectures. Experiments on multiple public 3D medical segmentation datasets and a challenging aggregated dataset show that the distilled lightweight model attains accuracy close to the teacher while markedly reducing parameters and inference latency, underscoring its practicality for clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art image generation but are too computationally expensive for on-device deployment on mobile and edge devices due to high memory and computational costs.

Method: Three key components: 1) Compact DiT architecture with adaptive global-local sparse attention, 2) Elastic training framework that jointly optimizes sub-DiTs of varying capacities within a unified supernetwork, 3) Knowledge-Guided Distribution Matching Distillation (step-distillation pipeline combining DMD objective with knowledge transfer from few-step teacher models).

Result: Achieves transformer-level generation quality under strict resource constraints, enables dynamic adjustment for efficient inference across different hardware, and produces high-fidelity, low-latency generation (e.g., 4-step) suitable for real-time on-device use.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables scalable, efficient, and high-quality diffusion models that can be deployed on diverse mobile and edge hardware while maintaining generation quality comparable to full transformer models.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) have set new standards in image generation, yet remain impractical for on-device deployment due to their high computational and memory costs. In this work, we present an efficient DiT framework tailored for mobile and edge devices that achieves transformer-level generation quality under strict resource constraints. Our design combines three key components. First, we propose a compact DiT architecture with an adaptive global-local sparse attention mechanism that balances global context modeling and local detail preservation. Second, we propose an elastic training framework that jointly optimizes sub-DiTs of varying capacities within a unified supernetwork, allowing a single model to dynamically adjust for efficient inference across different hardware. Finally, we develop Knowledge-Guided Distribution Matching Distillation, a step-distillation pipeline that integrates the DMD objective with knowledge transfer from few-step teacher models, producing high-fidelity and low-latency generation (e.g., 4-step) suitable for real-time on-device use. Together, these contributions enable scalable, efficient, and high-quality diffusion models for deployment on diverse hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMMs show strong zero-shot IQA capability but require computationally expensive fine-tuning for state-of-the-art performance. The authors aim to develop a training-free alternative that maintains high performance while being resource-efficient.

Method: IQARAG uses RAG to retrieve semantically similar but quality-variant reference images with Mean Opinion Scores. These retrieved images provide visual perception anchors and are integrated with the input image in a specific prompt. The framework has three phases: Retrieval Feature Extraction, Image Retrieval, and Integration & Quality Score Generation.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple IQA datasets (KADID, KonIQ, LIVE Challenge, SPAQ) demonstrate that IQARAG effectively boosts LMMs' IQA performance without requiring fine-tuning.

Conclusion: IQARAG offers a resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning for quality assessment, enhancing LMMs' IQA ability through training-free RAG-based approach with quality-variant reference images.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently shown remarkable promise in low-level visual perception tasks, particularly in Image Quality Assessment (IQA), demonstrating strong zero-shot capability. However, achieving state-of-the-art performance often requires computationally expensive fine-tuning methods, which aim to align the distribution of quality-related token in output with image quality levels. Inspired by recent training-free works for LMM, we introduce IQARAG, a novel, training-free framework that enhances LMMs' IQA ability. IQARAG leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve some semantically similar but quality-variant reference images with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) for input image. These retrieved images and input image are integrated into a specific prompt. Retrieved images provide the LMM with a visual perception anchor for IQA task. IQARAG contains three key phases: Retrieval Feature Extraction, Image Retrieval, and Integration & Quality Score Generation. Extensive experiments across multiple diverse IQA datasets, including KADID, KonIQ, LIVE Challenge, and SPAQ, demonstrate that the proposed IQARAG effectively boosts the IQA performance of LMMs, offering a resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning for quality assessment.

Abstract: The use of aerial drones for commercial and defense applications has benefited in many ways and is therefore utilized in several different application domains. However, they are also increasingly used for targeted attacks, posing a significant safety challenge and necessitating the development of drone detection systems.

TL;DR: UM-Text is a unified multimodal model for visual text editing that uses natural language instructions to generate style-consistent text in images, achieving state-of-the-art performance through VLM-based context understanding and specialized training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous visual text editing methods require complex manual specification of text attributes (font, color, layout) without considering stylistic consistency with reference images. There's a need for a more intuitive, instruction-based approach that understands context and maintains visual harmony.

Method: Proposes UM-Text with: 1) Visual Language Model (VLM) to process instructions and reference images for context-aware text/layout design, 2) UM-Encoder to combine condition embeddings automatically configured by VLM, 3) Regional consistency loss for glyph generation supervision, 4) Three-stage training strategy, and 5) UM-DATA-200K dataset for training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public benchmarks through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The method demonstrates superior visual text editing with natural language instructions while maintaining style consistency.

Conclusion: UM-Text provides an effective unified multimodal solution for visual text editing that understands context through natural language instructions, generates harmonious visual text, and outperforms previous methods through its novel architecture and training approach.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of image generation, visual text editing using natural language instructions has received increasing attention. The main challenge of this task is to fully understand the instruction and reference image, and thus generate visual text that is style-consistent with the image. Previous methods often involve complex steps of specifying the text content and attributes, such as font size, color, and layout, without considering the stylistic consistency with the reference image. To address this, we propose UM-Text, a unified multimodal model for context understanding and visual text editing by natural language instructions. Specifically, we introduce a Visual Language Model (VLM) to process the instruction and reference image, so that the text content and layout can be elaborately designed according to the context information. To generate an accurate and harmonious visual text image, we further propose the UM-Encoder to combine the embeddings of various condition information, where the combination is automatically configured by VLM according to the input instruction. During training, we propose a regional consistency loss to offer more effective supervision for glyph generation on both latent and RGB space, and design a tailored three-stage training strategy to further enhance model performance. In addition, we contribute the UM-DATA-200K, a large-scale visual text image dataset on diverse scenes for model training. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs struggle to balance high-quality image generation with training stability. Existing techniques like DCGAN, BigGAN, and StyleGAN improve visual fidelity but suffer from mode collapse and unstable gradients at high network depths.

Method: Proposes IGAN model incorporating deeper inception-inspired convolution and dilated convolution. Uses dropout and spectral normalization in both generator and discriminator to mitigate gradient explosion and overfitting.

Result: Achieves FID of 13.12 (CUB-200) and 15.08 (ImageNet), representing 28-33% improvement over state-of-the-art GANs. Attains IS of 9.27 and 68.25, reflecting improved image diversity and generation quality.

Conclusion: IGAN balances training stability with image generation quality, providing a scalable and computationally efficient framework for high-fidelity image synthesis.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) face a significant challenge of striking an optimal balance between high-quality image generation and training stability. Recent techniques, such as DCGAN, BigGAN, and StyleGAN, improve visual fidelity; however, such techniques usually struggle with mode collapse and unstable gradients at high network depth. This paper proposes a novel GAN structural model that incorporates deeper inception-inspired convolution and dilated convolution. This novel model is termed the Inception Generative Adversarial Network (IGAN). The IGAN model generates high-quality synthetic images while maintaining training stability, by reducing mode collapse as well as preventing vanishing and exploding gradients. Our proposed IGAN model achieves the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 13.12 and 15.08 on the CUB-200 and ImageNet datasets, respectively, representing a 28-33% improvement in FID over the state-of-the-art GANs. Additionally, the IGAN model attains an Inception Score (IS) of 9.27 and 68.25, reflecting improved image diversity and generation quality. Finally, the two techniques of dropout and spectral normalization are utilized in both the generator and discriminator structures to further mitigate gradient explosion and overfitting. These findings confirm that the IGAN model potentially balances training stability with image generation quality, constituting a scalable and computationally efficient framework for high-fidelity image synthesis.

Conclusion: BioMorphNet effectively integrates tissue morphology and spatial gene expression, supporting tumor localization and biomarker discovery through improved classification and differential gene analysis capabilities.

Abstract: Automatic integration of whole slide images (WSIs) and gene expression profiles has demonstrated substantial potential in precision clinical diagnosis and cancer progression studies. However, most existing studies focus on individual gene sequences and slide level classification tasks, with limited attention to spatial transcriptomics and patch level applications. To address this limitation, we propose a multimodal network, BioMorphNet, which automatically integrates tissue morphological features and spatial gene expression to support tissue classification and differential gene analysis. For considering morphological features, BioMorphNet constructs a graph to model the relationships between target patches and their neighbors, and adjusts the response strength based on morphological and molecular level similarity, to better characterize the tumor microenvironment. In terms of multimodal interactions, BioMorphNet derives clinical pathway features from spatial transcriptomic data based on a predefined pathway database, serving as a bridge between tissue morphology and gene expression. In addition, a novel learnable pathway module is designed to automatically simulate the biological pathway formation process, providing a complementary representation to existing clinical pathways. Compared with the latest morphology gene multimodal methods, BioMorphNet's average classification metrics improve by 2.67%, 5.48%, and 6.29% for prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer datasets, respectively. BioMorphNet not only classifies tissue categories within WSIs accurately to support tumor localization, but also analyzes differential gene expression between tissue categories based on prediction confidence, contributing to the discovery of potential tumor biomarkers.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard SR benchmarks show IET achieves state-of-the-art performance under comparable computational complexity.

Conclusion: IET's token-adaptive asymmetric attention design enables more precise information aggregation while maintaining computational efficiency, addressing limitations of fixed-group attention in transformer-based SISR.

Abstract: Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is a fundamental computer vision task that aims to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) input. Transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable performance by modeling long-range dependencies in degraded images. However, their feature-intensive attention computation incurs high computational cost. To improve efficiency, most existing approaches partition images into fixed groups and restrict attention within each group. Such group-wise attention overlooks the inherent asymmetry in token similarities, thereby failing to enable flexible and token-adaptive attention computation. To address this limitation, we propose the Individualized Exploratory Transformer (IET), which introduces a novel Individualized Exploratory Attention (IEA) mechanism that allows each token to adaptively select its own content-aware and independent attention candidates. This token-adaptive and asymmetric design enables more precise information aggregation while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on standard SR benchmarks demonstrate that IET achieves state-of-the-art performance under comparable computational complexity.

*Guo Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs show strong performance on benchmarks but suffer severe semantic misalignment under realistic perception degradation, despite only moderate drops in segmentation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are increasingly used in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, but their robustness to realistic perception degradation remains poorly understood. Current benchmarks don't capture how moderate perception errors affect downstream semantic reasoning.

Method: Systematically study semantic misalignment in VLMs under controlled degradation of upstream visual perception using semantic segmentation on Cityscapes dataset. Introduce perception-realistic corruptions and propose language-level misalignment metrics (hallucination, critical omission, safety misinterpretation).

Result: Perception-realistic corruptions cause only moderate drops in segmentation metrics but lead to severe VLM failures: hallucinated object mentions, omission of safety-critical entities, and inconsistent safety judgments. Clear disconnect between pixel-level robustness and multimodal semantic reliability.

Conclusion: Current VLM-based systems have critical limitations in safety-critical applications due to disconnect between perception metrics and semantic reliability. Need for evaluation frameworks that explicitly account for perception uncertainty in safety-critical domains.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous driving and embodied AI systems, where reliable perception is critical for safe semantic reasoning and decision-making. While recent VLMs demonstrate strong performance on multimodal benchmarks, their robustness to realistic perception degradation remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically study semantic misalignment in VLMs under controlled degradation of upstream visual perception, using semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset as a representative perception module. We introduce perception-realistic corruptions that induce only moderate drops in conventional segmentation metrics, yet observe severe failures in downstream VLM behavior, including hallucinated object mentions, omission of safety-critical entities, and inconsistent safety judgments. To quantify these effects, we propose a set of language-level misalignment metrics that capture hallucination, critical omission, and safety misinterpretation, and analyze their relationship with segmentation quality across multiple contrastive and generative VLMs. Our results reveal a clear disconnect between pixel-level robustness and multimodal semantic reliability, highlighting a critical limitation of current VLM-based systems and motivating the need for evaluation frameworks that explicitly account for perception uncertainty in safety-critical applications.

*Anastasios Tsalakopoulos,Angelos Kanlis,Evangelos Chatzis,Antonis Karakottas,Dimitrios Zarpalas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-NVS-w is a geometry-aware framework for high-fidelity novel view synthesis from unstructured, in-the-wild image collections that uses SDF-based geometry representation and a novel geometry-preservation loss to achieve photorealistic results with geometric coherence while reducing energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing in-the-wild novel view synthesis methods often lack geometric grounding on complex surfaces, producing results with inconsistencies. The authors aim to address this limitation by creating a framework that maintains geometric coherence while working with unstructured, real-world image collections.

Method: The framework leverages an underlying geometric representation based on a Signed Distance Function (SDF) to guide the rendering process, complemented by a novel Geometry-Preservation Loss that ensures fine structural details are preserved during synthesis.

Result: Geo-NVS-w achieves competitive rendering performance while demonstrating a 4-5x reduction in energy consumption compared to similar methods. It produces photorealistic results with sharp, geometrically coherent details for in-the-wild novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: Geo-NVS-w is a robust method for in-the-wild novel view synthesis that successfully addresses geometric inconsistency issues through SDF-based geometry representation and specialized loss functions, offering both high-quality results and significant energy efficiency improvements.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-NVS-w, a geometry-aware framework for high-fidelity novel view synthesis from unstructured, in-the-wild image collections. While existing in-the-wild methods already excel at novel view synthesis, they often lack geometric grounding on complex surfaces, sometimes producing results that contain inconsistencies. Geo-NVS-w addresses this limitation by leveraging an underlying geometric representation based on a Signed Distance Function (SDF) to guide the rendering process. This is complemented by a novel Geometry-Preservation Loss which ensures that fine structural details are preserved. Our framework achieves competitive rendering performance, while demonstrating a 4-5x reduction reduction in energy consumption compared to similar methods. We demonstrate that Geo-NVS-w is a robust method for in-the-wild NVS, yielding photorealistic results with sharp, geometrically coherent details.

### [58] [Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Geospatial Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08375)
*Yuan Gao,Di Cao,Xiaohuan Xi,Sheng Nie,Shaobo Xia,Cheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoGo is a source-free unsupervised domain adaptation framework for geospatial point cloud segmentation that addresses domain shift without access to source data, using local-global dual-consensus approach to handle long-tailed distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geospatial point cloud segmentation suffers from domain shifts across regions and data acquisition strategies. Existing domain adaptation methods require source data, which is often unavailable due to privacy, regulations, and transmission limitations, motivating source-free UDA.

Method: LoGo uses: 1) Local class-balanced prototype estimation with intra-class independent anchor mining (instead of global threshold filtering) to handle tail classes; 2) Global optimal transport-based distribution alignment to correct head class dominance; 3) Dual-consistency pseudo-label filtering that requires agreement between local ensemble predictions and global OT assignments.

Result: The framework effectively mitigates feature collapse in long-tailed distributions, prevents model bias toward majority classes, and generates robust pseudo-labels for self-training in source-free settings.

Conclusion: LoGo provides a novel SFUDA solution for geospatial point clouds that addresses domain adaptation challenges without source data access, effectively handling long-tailed distributions through local-global consensus mechanisms.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D geospatial point clouds is pivotal for remote sensing applications. However, variations in geographic patterns across regions and data acquisition strategies induce significant domain shifts, severely degrading the performance of deployed models. Existing domain adaptation methods typically rely on access to source-domain data. However, this requirement is rarely met due to data privacy concerns, regulatory policies, and data transmission limitations. This motivates the largely underexplored setting of source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA), where only a pretrained model and unlabeled target-domain data are available. In this paper, we propose LoGo (Local-Global Dual-Consensus), a novel SFUDA framework specifically designed for geospatial point clouds. At the local level, we introduce a class-balanced prototype estimation module that abandons conventional global threshold filtering in favor of an intra-class independent anchor mining strategy. This ensures that robust feature prototypes can be generated even for sample-scarce tail classes, effectively mitigating the feature collapse caused by long-tailed distributions. At the global level, we introduce an optimal transport-based global distribution alignment module that formulates pseudo-label assignment as a global optimization problem. By enforcing global distribution constraints, this module effectively corrects the over-dominance of head classes inherent in local greedy assignments, preventing model predictions from being severely biased towards majority classes. Finally, we propose a dual-consistency pseudo-label filtering mechanism. This strategy retains only high-confidence pseudo-labels where local multi-augmented ensemble predictions align with global optimal transport assignments for self-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing multimodal Earth observation data (HSI, LiDAR), there's a need for methods that fuse spectral, spatial, and geometric information while enabling semantic-level understanding through natural language guidance.

Method: Proposes Multimodal Language-Guided Network (MMLGNet) with modality-specific encoders for HSI and LiDAR, aligns visual features with handcrafted textual embeddings in shared latent space via bi-directional contrastive learning inspired by CLIP's training paradigm.

Result: MMLGNet outperforms established multimodal visual-only methods on two benchmark datasets, achieving strong performance with simple CNN-based encoders, demonstrating significant benefit of language supervision.

Conclusion: Language supervision effectively bridges high-dimensional remote sensing data with semantic interpretation, enabling better multimodal fusion and understanding of Earth observation data through natural language alignment.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework, Multimodal Language-Guided Network (MMLGNet), to align heterogeneous remote sensing modalities like Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) and LiDAR with natural language semantics using vision-language models such as CLIP. With the increasing availability of multimodal Earth observation data, there is a growing need for methods that effectively fuse spectral, spatial, and geometric information while enabling semantic-level understanding. MMLGNet employs modality-specific encoders and aligns visual features with handcrafted textual embeddings in a shared latent space via bi-directional contrastive learning. Inspired by CLIP's training paradigm, our approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional remote sensing data and language-guided interpretation. Notably, MMLGNet achieves strong performance with simple CNN-based encoders, outperforming several established multimodal visual-only methods on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating the significant benefit of language supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A patch-based facial animation retargeting method that transfers expressions from source video to stylized 3D characters while preserving semantic meaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current facial retargeting methods work well for similar human-like models but struggle with stylized/exaggerated 3D characters that deviate from human facial structures. There's a need to preserve semantic meaning when transferring animations to characters with different facial proportions.

Method: Three-module approach: 1) Automatic Patch Extraction Module extracts local patches from source video frames, 2) Reenactment Module generates corresponding re-enacted target local patches, 3) Weight Estimation Module calculates animation parameters for the target character to create complete facial animation sequences.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method successfully transfers semantic meaning of source facial expressions to stylized characters with considerable variations in facial feature proportions.

Conclusion: The proposed patch-based retargeting method effectively addresses the challenge of transferring facial animations to stylized 3D characters while preserving the semantic meaning of original expressions, even when characters have exaggerated facial structures.

Abstract: In the era of digital animation, the quest to produce lifelike facial animations for virtual characters has led to the development of various retargeting methods. While the retargeting facial motion between models of similar shapes has been very successful, challenges arise when the retargeting is performed on stylized or exaggerated 3D characters that deviate significantly from human facial structures. In this scenario, it is important to consider the target character's facial structure and possible range of motion to preserve the semantics assumed by the original facial motions after the retargeting. To achieve this, we propose a local patch-based retargeting method that transfers facial animations captured in a source performance video to a target stylized 3D character. Our method consists of three modules. The Automatic Patch Extraction Module extracts local patches from the source video frame. These patches are processed through the Reenactment Module to generate correspondingly re-enacted target local patches. The Weight Estimation Module calculates the animation parameters for the target character at every frame for the creation of a complete facial animation sequence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can successfully transfer the semantic meaning of source facial expressions to stylized characters with considerable variations in facial feature proportion.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing echocardiography foundation models fail to capture relationships between measurements and clinical manifestations, while medical reasoning MLLMs require costly detailed reasoning path construction and cannot effectively incorporate echocardiographic priors into reasoning.

Method: Proposes Cardiac Reasoning Template (CRT) for stepwise canonical diagnostic procedures, and CardiacMind reinforcement learning scheme with three novel rewards: Procedural Quantity Reward (PQtR), Procedural Quality Reward (PQlR), and Echocardiographic Semantic Reward (ESR).

Result: 48% improvement in multiview echocardiographic diagnosis for 15 complex cardiac diseases, 5% improvement on CardiacNet-PAH over prior methods, and 93.33% clinician agreement with cardiologist-like reasoning logic in user study.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances MLLM's echocardiographic reasoning by introducing cardiologist-like mindset through structured templates and reinforcement learning, demonstrating significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning quality.

Abstract: Echocardiographic diagnosis is vital for cardiac screening yet remains challenging. Existing echocardiography foundation models do not effectively capture the relationships between quantitative measurements and clinical manifestations, whereas medical reasoning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) require costly construction of detailed reasoning paths and remain ineffective at directly incorporating such echocardiographic priors into their reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach comprising Cardiac Reasoning Template (CRT) and CardiacMind to enhance MLLM's echocardiographic reasoning by introducing cardiologist-like mindset. Specifically, CRT provides stepwise canonical diagnostic procedures for complex cardiac diseases to streamline reasoning path construction without the need for costly case-by-case verification. To incentivize reasoning MLLM under CRT, we develop CardiacMind, a new reinforcement learning scheme with three novel rewards: Procedural Quantity Reward (PQtR), Procedural Quality Reward (PQlR), and Echocardiographic Semantic Reward (ESR). PQtR promotes detailed reasoning; PQlR promotes integration of evidence across views and modalities, while ESR grounds stepwise descriptions in visual content. Our methods show a 48% improvement in multiview echocardiographic diagnosis for 15 complex cardiac diseases and a 5% improvement on CardiacNet-PAH over prior methods. The user study on our method's reasoning outputs shows 93.33% clinician agreement with cardiologist-like reasoning logic. Our code will be available.

### [65] [Noise-Adaptive Regularization for Robust Multi-Label Remote Sensing Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08446)
*Tom Burgert,Julia Henkel,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAR is a noise-adaptive regularization method for multi-label classification in remote sensing that distinguishes between additive and subtractive label noise, using confidence-based label handling and early-learning regularization to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-label classification in remote sensing increasingly uses cost-effective but noisy annotations from thematic products or crowdsourcing, which introduce additive noise (incorrect labels added), subtractive noise (correct labels missing), or mixed noise. Previous methods treat all noise uniformly without adapting to different noise types.

Method: NAR uses a confidence-based label handling mechanism: retains high-confidence labels, temporarily deactivates moderate-confidence labels, and flips low-confidence labels. This selective attenuation integrates with early-learning regularization (ELR) to stabilize training and prevent overfitting to corrupted labels.

Result: NAR consistently improves robustness across additive, subtractive, and mixed noise scenarios, with most pronounced improvements under subtractive and mixed noise conditions.

Conclusion: Adaptive suppression and selective correction of noisy supervision provides an effective strategy for noise-robust learning in remote sensing multi-label classification, addressing the limitations of previous methods that treat all noise uniformly.

Abstract: The development of reliable methods for multi-label classification (MLC) has become a prominent research direction in remote sensing (RS). As the scale of RS data continues to expand, annotation procedures increasingly rely on thematic products or crowdsourced procedures to reduce the cost of manual annotation. While cost-effective, these strategies often introduce multi-label noise in the form of partially incorrect annotations. In MLC, label noise arises as additive noise, subtractive noise, or a combination of both in the form of mixed noise. Previous work has largely overlooked this distinction and commonly treats noisy annotations as supervised signals, lacking mechanisms that explicitly adapt learning behavior to different noise types. To address this limitation, we propose NAR, a noise-adaptive regularization method that explicitly distinguishes between additive and subtractive noise within a semi-supervised learning framework. NAR employs a confidence-based label handling mechanism that dynamically retains label entries with high confidence, temporarily deactivates entries with moderate confidence, and corrects low confidence entries via flipping. This selective attenuation of supervision is integrated with early-learning regularization (ELR) to stabilize training and mitigate overfitting to corrupted labels. Experiments across additive, subtractive, and mixed noise scenarios demonstrate that NAR consistently improves robustness compared with existing methods. Performance improvements are most pronounced under subtractive and mixed noise, indicating that adaptive suppression and selective correction of noisy supervision provide an effective strategy for noise robust learning in RS MLC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the stability-plasticity dilemma in few-shot class-incremental learning where models need to continuously recognize novel classes with limited data while retaining old knowledge.

Method: Proposes Static-Dynamic Collaboration (SDC) framework with two stages: 1) Static Retaining Stage (SRS) trains initial model with base session data and preserves key parts as static memory; 2) Dynamic Learning Stage (DLS) introduces extra dynamic projector jointly trained with static memory to adapt to new classes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks and a real-world application dataset, demonstrating improved retention of old knowledge while continuously adapting to new classes.

Conclusion: The SDC framework effectively balances stability and plasticity in FSCIL by separating static knowledge retention from dynamic adaptation, providing a practical solution to the key challenge in few-shot class-incremental learning.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously recognize novel classes under limited data, which suffers from the key stability-plasticity dilemma: balancing the retention of old knowledge with the acquisition of new knowledge. To address this issue, we divide the task into two different stages and propose a framework termed Static-Dynamic Collaboration (SDC) to achieve a better trade-off between stability and plasticity. Specifically, our method divides the normal pipeline of FSCIL into Static Retaining Stage (SRS) and Dynamic Learning Stage (DLS), which harnesses old static and incremental dynamic class information, respectively. During SRS, we train an initial model with sufficient data in the base session and preserve the key part as static memory to retain fundamental old knowledge. During DLS, we introduce an extra dynamic projector jointly trained with the previous static memory. By employing both stages, our method achieves improved retention of old knowledge while continuously adapting to new classes. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a real-world application dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance against other competitors.

TL;DR: A radiomics and machine learning framework was developed to predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy response in high-grade serous ovarian cancer using CT imaging, achieving AUC up to 0.83 by integrating robustness into feature selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma is typically diagnosed at advanced stages with peritoneal metastases, making treatment challenging. About 40% of patients show limited response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, creating a need for non-invasive methods to predict treatment response before surgery.

Method: Developed a framework using radiomics and machine learning with CT imaging data. Employed an automated randomization algorithm to mimic inter-observer variability for robust feature selection. Used four response metrics (CRS, RECIST, VolR, DiaR) and analyzed lesions from different anatomical sites. Pre- and post-NACT CT scans were used for feature extraction and model training on one cohort, with external validation on an independent cohort.

Result: Best prediction performance was achieved using all lesions combined for volume reduction prediction (AUC 0.83). Omental lesions provided best results for chemotherapy response score prediction (AUC 0.77), while pelvic lesions performed best for diameter reduction prediction (AUC 0.76).

Conclusion: Integrating robustness into feature selection ensures development of reliable radiomics models for clinical applications in HGSOC. Future work should explore further applications in real-time clinical settings.

Abstract: Objectives: High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage with extensive peritoneal metastases, making treatment challenging. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is often used to reduce tumor burden before surgery, but about 40% of patients show limited response. Radiomics, combined with machine learning (ML), offers a promising non-invasive method for predicting NACT response by analyzing computed tomography (CT) imaging data. This study aimed to improve response prediction in HGSOC patients undergoing NACT by integration different feature selection methods. Materials and methods: A framework for selecting robust radiomics features was introduced by employing an automated randomisation algorithm to mimic inter-observer variability, ensuring a balance between feature robustness and prediction accuracy. Four response metrics were used: chemotherapy response score (CRS), RECIST, volume reduction (VolR), and diameter reduction (DiaR). Lesions in different anatomical sites were studied. Pre- and post-NACT CT scans were used for feature extraction and model training on one cohort, and an independent cohort was used for external testing. Results: The best prediction performance was achieved using all lesions combined for VolR prediction, with an AUC of 0.83. Omental lesions provided the best results for CRS prediction (AUC 0.77), while pelvic lesions performed best for DiaR (AUC 0.76). Conclusion: The integration of robustness into the feature selection processes ensures the development of reliable models and thus facilitates the implementation of the radiomics models in clinical applications for HGSOC patients. Future work should explore further applications of radiomics in ovarian cancer, particularly in real-time clinical settings.

### [68] [Modality-Decoupled RGB-Thermal Object Detector via Query Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08458)
*Chao Tian,Zikun Zhou,Chao Yang,Guoqing Zhu,Fu'an Zhong,Zhenyu He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDQF is a modality-decoupled RGB-Thermal detection framework that balances complementation and separation through query fusion between separate RGB and TIR branches, enabling robust detection under extreme conditions and training with unpaired data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-T detection benefits from modality fusion but suffers under extreme conditions where one modality degrades and introduces noise. Current approaches need to better balance complementation (using both modalities) and separation (avoiding degraded modality noise).

Method: Proposes MDQF with separate DETR-like branches for RGB and TIR images. Uses query fusion between branches at each refinement stage - selects high-quality queries from one branch, adapts them, and feeds to the other branch. This excludes degraded modality while correcting predictions. Framework supports training with unpaired RGB/TIR images.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance over existing RGB-T detectors and better modality independence. The approach effectively handles extreme conditions where one modality is degraded.

Conclusion: MDQF successfully balances modality complementation and separation through decoupled architecture with query fusion, enabling robust RGB-T detection under diverse conditions while eliminating the need for paired training data.

Abstract: The advantage of RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) detection lies in its ability to perform modality fusion and integrate cross-modality complementary information, enabling robust detection under diverse illumination and weather conditions. However, under extreme conditions where one modality exhibits poor quality and disturbs detection, modality separation is necessary to mitigate the impact of noise. To address this problem, we propose a Modality-Decoupled RGB-T detection framework with Query Fusion (MDQF) to balance modality complementation and separation. In this framework, DETR-like detectors are employed as separate branches for the RGB and TIR images, with query fusion interspersed between the two branches in each refinement stage. Herein, query fusion is performed by feeding the high-quality queries from one branch to the other one after query selection and adaptation. This design effectively excludes the degraded modality and corrects the predictions using high-quality queries. Moreover, the decoupled framework allows us to optimize each individual branch with unpaired RGB or TIR images, eliminating the need for paired RGB-T data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Architectural conceptual design (especially building massing) is complex, intuition-driven, and manual. Data-driven methods are hindered by lack of suitable datasets.

Method: Introduces CoMa-20K dataset with massing geometries, economic/programmatic data, and site context visuals. Benchmarks by formulating massing generation as conditional task for VLMs, evaluating both fine-tuned and zero-shot models.

Result: Experiments reveal task complexity but demonstrate VLMs' potential to produce context-sensitive massing options. Dataset establishes foundational benchmark.

Conclusion: The work provides essential dataset and analysis for data-driven architectural design, highlighting significant opportunities for future research in automated building massing generation.

Abstract: The conceptual design phase in architecture and urban planning, particularly building massing, is complex and heavily reliant on designer intuition and manual effort. To address this, we propose an automated framework for generating building massing based on functional requirements and site context. A primary obstacle to such data-driven methods has been the lack of suitable datasets. Consequently, we introduce the CoMa-20K dataset, a comprehensive collection that includes detailed massing geometries, associated economical and programmatic data, and visual representations of the development site within its existing urban context. We benchmark this dataset by formulating massing generation as a conditional task for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), evaluating both fine-tuned and large zero-shot models. Our experiments reveal the inherent complexity of the task while demonstrating the potential of VLMs to produce context-sensitive massing options. The dataset and analysis establish a foundational benchmark and highlight significant opportunities for future research in data-driven architectural design.

Conclusion: HazardForge enables scalable generation of hazardous scenarios for evaluating VLM safety, revealing significant performance gaps in handling anomalous objects and motion understanding that need addressing for safer autonomous systems.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous vehicles and mobile systems, making it crucial to evaluate their ability to support safer decision-making in complex environments. However, existing benchmarks inadequately cover diverse hazardous situations, especially anomalous scenarios with spatio-temporal dynamics. While image editing models are a promising means to synthesize such hazards, it remains challenging to generate well-formulated scenarios that include moving, intrusive, and distant objects frequently observed in the real world. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{HazardForge}, a scalable pipeline that leverages image editing models to generate these scenarios with layout decision algorithms, and validation modules. Using HazardForge, we construct \textbf{MovSafeBench}, a multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmark comprising 7,254 images and corresponding QA pairs across 13 object categories, covering both normal and anomalous objects. Experiments using MovSafeBench show that VLM performance degrades notably under conditions including anomalous objects, with the largest drop in scenarios requiring nuanced motion understanding.

### [71] [Cross-modal Proxy Evolving for OOD Detection with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08476)
*Hao Tang,Yu Liu,Shuanglin Yan,Fei Shen,Shengfeng He,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoEvo is a training-free test-time framework for zero-shot OOD detection that dynamically adapts both textual and visual proxies through co-evolution to improve cross-modal alignment and OOD margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot OOD detection methods rely on fixed textual proxies that sparsely sample semantic space and remain static while visual features drift, causing cross-modal misalignment and unstable predictions.

Method: CoEvo introduces a proxy-aligned co-evolution mechanism with two evolving proxy caches: dynamically mines contextual textual negatives guided by test images and iteratively refines visual proxies, then dynamically re-weights dual-modal proxies for calibrated OOD scores.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks: improves AUROC by 1.33% and reduces FPR95 by 45.98% on ImageNet-1K compared to strong negative-label baselines.

Conclusion: CoEvo effectively addresses cross-modal misalignment in zero-shot OOD detection through bidirectional, sample-conditioned adaptation of proxies, achieving robust performance without training or annotation.

Abstract: Reliable zero-shot detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is critical for deploying vision-language models in open-world settings. However, the lack of labeled negatives in zero-shot OOD detection necessitates proxy signals that remain effective under distribution shift. Existing negative-label methods rely on a fixed set of textual proxies, which (i) sparsely sample the semantic space beyond in-distribution (ID) classes and (ii) remain static while only visual features drift, leading to cross-modal misalignment and unstable predictions. In this paper, we propose CoEvo, a training- and annotation-free test-time framework that performs bidirectional, sample-conditioned adaptation of both textual and visual proxies. Specifically, CoEvo introduces a proxy-aligned co-evolution mechanism to maintain two evolving proxy caches, which dynamically mines contextual textual negatives guided by test images and iteratively refines visual proxies, progressively realigning cross-modal similarities and enlarging local OOD margins. Finally, we dynamically re-weight the contributions of dual-modal proxies to obtain a calibrated OOD score that is robust to distribution shift. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoEvo achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC by 1.33% and reducing FPR95 by 45.98% on ImageNet-1K compared to strong negative-label baselines.

Abstract: Maintaining optimal water quality in aquariums is critical for aquatic health but remains challenging due to the need for continuous monitoring of multiple parameters. Traditional manual methods are inefficient, labor-intensive, and prone to human error, often leading to suboptimal aquatic conditions.

*Kexin Baoa,Fanzhao Lin,Zichen Wang,Yong Li,Dan Zeng,Shiming Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PKI proposes a prior knowledge-infused neural network for few-shot class-incremental learning, using cascading projectors to preserve old knowledge while learning new classes, with variants to balance performance and resource consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSCIL faces two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting (losing old class knowledge) and overfitting to new classes with limited data. Existing methods freeze network components and use memory, but need better ways to preserve prior knowledge while learning new classes efficiently.

Method: PKI consists of backbone, ensemble of projectors, classifier, and memory. Each incremental session adds a new projector to the ensemble, then jointly finetunes only the new projector and classifier while keeping other components frozen. This cascading approach integrates prior knowledge from previous sessions while learning new knowledge flexibly. Two variants (PKIV-1, PKIV-2) reduce projectors to balance resource consumption and performance.

Result: Extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks demonstrate that PKI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot class-incremental learning.

Conclusion: PKI effectively addresses FSCIL challenges by preserving prior knowledge through cascading projectors while learning new classes efficiently, with variants offering resource-performance tradeoffs.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continually adapt a model on a limited number of new-class examples, facing two well-known challenges: catastrophic forgetting and overfitting to new classes. Existing methods tend to freeze more parts of network components and finetune others with an extra memory during incremental sessions. These methods emphasize preserving prior knowledge to ensure proficiency in recognizing old classes, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, constraining fewer parameters can help in overcoming overfitting with the assistance of prior knowledge. Following previous methods, we retain more prior knowledge and propose a prior knowledge-infused neural network (PKI) to facilitate FSCIL. PKI consists of a backbone, an ensemble of projectors, a classifier, and an extra memory. In each incremental session, we build a new projector and add it to the ensemble. Subsequently, we finetune the new projector and the classifier jointly with other frozen network components, ensuring the rich prior knowledge is utilized effectively. By cascading projectors, PKI integrates prior knowledge accumulated from previous sessions and learns new knowledge flexibly, which helps to recognize old classes and efficiently learn new classes. Further, to reduce the resource consumption associated with keeping many projectors, we design two variants of the prior knowledge-infused neural network (PKIV-1 and PKIV-2) to trade off a balance between resource consumption and performance by reducing the number of projectors. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision Transformers show superior few-shot classification performance but require extensive GPU memory and training time for fine-tuning, making them impractical for low-resource scenarios.

Method: Proposes three key components: 1) Lightweight trainable Forward Block to synthesize task-specific queries, 2) Combine Block to fuse multi-layer outputs, and 3) Support-Query Attention Block to mitigate distribution shift by aligning prototypes with query set distribution.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four in-domain few-shot datasets and six cross-domain datasets with minimal trainable parameters.

Conclusion: EfficientFSL bridges the gap between powerful large models and practical low-resource applications by enabling efficient few-shot learning with Vision Transformers through query-only fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large models such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable superiority over smaller architectures like ResNet in few-shot classification, owing to their powerful representational capacity. However, fine-tuning such large models demands extensive GPU memory and prolonged training time, making them impractical for many real-world low-resource scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose EfficientFSL, a query-only fine-tuning framework tailored specifically for few-shot classification with ViT, which achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. EfficientFSL fully leverages the knowledge embedded in the pre-trained model and its strong comprehension ability, achieving high classification accuracy with an extremely small number of tunable parameters. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight trainable Forward Block to synthesize task-specific queries that extract informative features from the intermediate representations of the pre-trained model in a query-only manner. We further propose a Combine Block to fuse multi-layer outputs, enhancing the depth and robustness of feature representations. Finally, a Support-Query Attention Block mitigates distribution shift by adjusting prototypes to align with the query set distribution. With minimal trainable parameters, EfficientFSL achieves state-of-the-art performance on four in-domain few-shot datasets and six cross-domain datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.

TL;DR: LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search for channel configuration optimization using code generation and AST mutations to overcome data scarcity, achieving significant accuracy improvements on CIFAR-100.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Channel configuration optimization is a complex combinatorial problem in neural architecture design. Traditional heuristics lack reasoning capabilities about architectural code structure, while LLMs offer transformative potential for NAS by understanding and generating architectural specifications.

Method: Formulates channel configuration search as sequence of conditional code generation tasks where LLM refines architectural specs based on performance telemetry. Addresses data scarcity by generating large corpus of valid architectures via Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) mutations to provide structural data for learning relationships between channel configurations and performance.

Result: Experimental results on CIFAR-100 show statistically significant improvements in accuracy. LLM successfully acquires domain-specific architectural priors, distinguishing the approach from random search and demonstrating language-driven design potential.

Conclusion: LLM-driven NAS framework effectively optimizes channel configurations by learning complex design patterns from structural data, highlighting the transformative potential of language models in deep learning architecture design.

Abstract: Channel configuration search the optimization of layer specifications such as layer widths in deep neural networks presents a complex combinatorial challenge constrained by tensor shape compatibility and computational budgets. We posit that Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transformative approach to Neural Architecture Search (NAS), capable of reasoning about architectural code structure in ways that traditional heuristics cannot. In this paper, we investigate the application of an LLM-driven NAS framework to the problem of channel configuration. We formulate the search as a sequence of conditional code generation tasks, where an LLM refines architectural specifications based on performance telemetry. Crucially, we address the data scarcity problem by generating a vast corpus of valid, shape-consistent architectures via Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) mutations. While these mutated networks are not necessarily high-performing, they provide the critical volume of structural data required for the LLM to learn the latent relationship between channel configurations and model performance. This allows the LLM to internalize complex design patterns and apply them to optimize feature extraction strategies. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 validate the efficacy of this approach, demonstrating that the model yields statistically significant improvements in accuracy. Our analysis confirms that the LLM successfully acquires domain-specific architectural priors, distinguishing this method from random search and highlighting the immense potential of language-driven design in deep learning.

TL;DR: CD² framework uses dataset distillation and constraints to address catastrophic forgetting in few-shot class-incremental learning, outperforming SOTA methods on three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSCIL methods use external memory but treat all incremental classes equally, failing to properly preserve essential previous knowledge and suffering from catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Proposes Constrained Dataset Distillation (CD²) with two modules: Dataset Distillation Module (DDM) synthesizes condensed samples guided by classifier to learn compact class-related clues, and Distillation Constraint Module (DCM) uses designed loss to constrain previously learned class distribution and preserve distilled knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art competitors.

Conclusion: CD² effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting in FSCIL by distilling essential knowledge and constraining class distributions, achieving better performance than existing methods.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) receives significant attention from the public to perform classification continuously with a few training samples, which suffers from the key catastrophic forgetting problem. Existing methods usually employ an external memory to store previous knowledge and treat it with incremental classes equally, which cannot properly preserve previous essential knowledge. To solve this problem and inspired by recent distillation works on knowledge transfer, we propose a framework termed \textbf{C}onstrained \textbf{D}ataset \textbf{D}istillation (\textbf{CD$^2$}) to facilitate FSCIL, which includes a dataset distillation module (\textbf{DDM}) and a distillation constraint module~(\textbf{DCM}). Specifically, the DDM synthesizes highly condensed samples guided by the classifier, forcing the model to learn compacted essential class-related clues from a few incremental samples. The DCM introduces a designed loss to constrain the previously learned class distribution, which can preserve distilled knowledge more sufficiently. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show the superiority of our method against other state-of-the-art competitors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoHEDGE: A modular framework for detecting hallucinations in video question answering models using semantic entropy and reliability scores from perturbed video inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-VLMs frequently produce high-confidence hallucinations, and existing uncertainty metrics fail to align with correctness, creating a need for effective hallucination detection methods.

Method: Generates baseline answers and multiple high-temperature outputs from clean and perturbed video clips, clusters textual outputs into semantic hypotheses using NLI or embedding methods, then computes three reliability scores: Semantic Entropy (SE), RadFlag, and Vision-Amplified Semantic Entropy (VASE).

Result: VASE consistently achieves highest ROC-AUC across three 7B Video-VLMs, especially with larger distortion budgets, while SE and RadFlag often perform near chance. Embedding-based clustering matches NLI performance at lower computational cost.

Conclusion: VideoHEDGE provides effective hallucination detection for video QA, with VASE as the most reliable metric, and offers a reproducible framework through the hedge-bench library.

Abstract: Hallucinations in video-capable vision-language models (Video-VLMs) remain frequent and high-confidence, while existing uncertainty metrics often fail to align with correctness. We introduce VideoHEDGE, a modular framework for hallucination detection in video question answering that extends entropy-based reliability estimation from images to temporally structured inputs. Given a video-question pair, VideoHEDGE draws a baseline answer and multiple high-temperature generations from both clean clips and photometrically and spatiotemporally perturbed variants, then clusters the resulting textual outputs into semantic hypotheses using either Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based or embedding-based methods. Cluster-level probability masses yield three reliability scores: Semantic Entropy (SE), RadFlag, and Vision-Amplified Semantic Entropy (VASE). We evaluate VideoHEDGE on the SoccerChat benchmark using an LLM-as-a-judge to obtain binary hallucination labels. Across three 7B Video-VLMs (Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, and a SoccerChat-finetuned model), VASE consistently achieves the highest ROC-AUC, especially at larger distortion budgets, while SE and RadFlag often operate near chance. We further show that embedding-based clustering matches NLI-based clustering in detection performance at substantially lower computational cost, and that domain fine-tuning reduces hallucination frequency but yields only modest improvements in calibration. The hedge-bench PyPI library enables reproducible and extensible benchmarking, with full code and experimental resources available at https://github.com/Simula/HEDGE#videohedge .

*Zhifan Ni,Eckehard Steinbach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REVNET is a rotation-equivariant anchor transformer framework for robust point cloud completion under arbitrary rotations, using Vector Neuron networks to preserve local details without requiring pose alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most point cloud completion methods are rotation-variant and require canonical pose alignment, limiting real-world applicability. Random rotation augmentation increases learning burden and doesn't guarantee robust performance under arbitrary poses.

Method: Proposes Rotation-Equivariant Anchor Transformer (REVNET) built on Vector Neuron networks. Represents partial point clouds as equivariant anchors, uses VN Missing Anchor Transformer to predict missing anchors, extends VN networks with rotation-equivariant bias and ZCA-based layer normalization for better feature expressiveness.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on synthetic MVP dataset in equivariant setting. On real-world KITTI dataset, delivers competitive results compared to non-equivariant networks without requiring input pose alignment.

Conclusion: REVNET provides a robust solution for point cloud completion under arbitrary rotations, eliminating the need for pose alignment while maintaining competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Incomplete point clouds captured by 3D sensors often result in the loss of both geometric and semantic information. Most existing point cloud completion methods are built on rotation-variant frameworks trained with data in canonical poses, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. While data augmentation with random rotations can partially mitigate this issue, it significantly increases the learning burden and still fails to guarantee robust performance under arbitrary poses. To address this challenge, we propose the Rotation-Equivariant Anchor Transformer (REVNET), a novel framework built upon the Vector Neuron (VN) network for robust point cloud completion under arbitrary rotations. To preserve local details, we represent partial point clouds as sets of equivariant anchors and design a VN Missing Anchor Transformer to predict the positions and features of missing anchors. Furthermore, we extend VN networks with a rotation-equivariant bias formulation and a ZCA-based layer normalization to improve feature expressiveness. Leveraging the flexible conversion between equivariant and invariant VN features, our model can generate point coordinates with greater stability. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the synthetic MVP dataset in the equivariant setting. On the real-world KITTI dataset, REVNET delivers competitive results compared to non-equivariant networks, without requiring input pose alignment. The source code will be released on GitHub under URL: https://github.com/nizhf/REVNET.

*Zhengbo Xu,Jie Ma,Ziheng Wang,Zhan Peng,Jun Liang,Jing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoCha is a novel framework for controllable video character replacement that requires only a single arbitrary frame mask, bypassing limitations of prior reconstruction-based methods that need per-frame masks and explicit structural guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video character replacement methods rely heavily on per-frame segmentation masks and explicit structural guidance (skeleton, depth), which severely limits their generalizability in complex scenarios involving occlusions, character-object interactions, unusual poses, or challenging illumination, often leading to visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies.

Method: MoCha introduces a condition-aware RoPE to adapt multi-modal input conditions and enhance facial identity, employs an RL-based post-training stage, and uses a comprehensive data construction pipeline with three specialized datasets: a high-fidelity rendered dataset built with Unreal Engine 5, an expression-driven dataset synthesized by portrait animation techniques, and an augmented dataset from existing video-mask pairs.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoCha substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in video character replacement tasks.

Conclusion: MoCha represents a pioneering framework that overcomes the limitations of prior methods by requiring only a single arbitrary frame mask, enabling more robust and generalizable video character replacement in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Controllable video character replacement with a user-provided identity remains a challenging problem due to the lack of paired video data. Prior works have predominantly relied on a reconstruction-based paradigm that requires per-frame segmentation masks and explicit structural guidance (e.g., skeleton, depth). This reliance, however, severely limits their generalizability in complex scenarios involving occlusions, character-object interactions, unusual poses, or challenging illumination, often leading to visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose MoCha, a pioneering framework that bypasses these limitations by requiring only a single arbitrary frame mask. To effectively adapt the multi-modal input condition and enhance facial identity, we introduce a condition-aware RoPE and employ an RL-based post-training stage. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of qualified paired-training data, we propose a comprehensive data construction pipeline. Specifically, we design three specialized datasets: a high-fidelity rendered dataset built with Unreal Engine 5 (UE5), an expression-driven dataset synthesized by current portrait animation techniques, and an augmented dataset derived from existing video-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. We will release the code to facilitate further research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveFormer replaces attention with wave propagation operator for efficient visual modeling, achieving competitive performance with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Transformers lack principled understanding of how semantic information propagates spatially in vision tasks. Attention mechanisms capture dependencies but don't model spatial frequency interactions systematically.

Method: Treat feature maps as spatial signals evolving over network depth via underdamped wave equation. Derive closed-form frequency-time decoupled solution implemented as Wave Propagation Operator (WPO) with O(N log N) complexity. Build WaveFormer models as drop-in replacements for ViTs and CNNs.

Result: Competitive accuracy on image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation with 1.6x higher throughput and 30% fewer FLOPs than attention-based alternatives. Wave propagation captures both global coherence and high-frequency details.

Conclusion: Wave-based modeling provides complementary bias to heat-based methods, offering efficient global interaction modeling while explicitly handling spatial frequency interactions across network depth.

Abstract: Vision modeling has advanced rapidly with Transformers, whose attention mechanisms capture visual dependencies but lack a principled account of how semantic information propagates spatially. We revisit this problem from a wave-based perspective: feature maps are treated as spatial signals whose evolution over an internal propagation time (aligned with network depth) is governed by an underdamped wave equation. In this formulation, spatial frequency-from low-frequency global layout to high-frequency edges and textures-is modeled explicitly, and its interaction with propagation time is controlled rather than implicitly fixed. We derive a closed-form, frequency-time decoupled solution and implement it as the Wave Propagation Operator (WPO), a lightweight module that models global interactions in O(N log N) time-far lower than attention. Building on WPO, we propose a family of WaveFormer models as drop-in replacements for standard ViTs and CNNs, achieving competitive accuracy across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, while delivering up to 1.6x higher throughput and 30% fewer FLOPs than attention-based alternatives. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that wave propagation introduces a complementary modeling bias to heat-based methods, effectively capturing both global coherence and high-frequency details essential for rich visual semantics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two interpretable AI methods for knee MRI analysis: radiomic fingerprints (patient-specific feature selection) and healthy personas (synthetic pathology-free baselines), achieving comparable performance to deep learning while maintaining clinical interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional radiomics are interpretable but restrictive, while deep learning lacks interpretability. There's a need for methods that combine accuracy with clinical interpretability for automated knee MRI assessment.

Method: Two complementary strategies: 1) Radiomic fingerprints - dynamically construct patient-specific feature sets using image-conditioned feature selection with transparent logistic regression. 2) Healthy personas - synthesize pathology-free baselines using diffusion models trained on healthy knee MRIs, enabling comparison with pathological images.

Result: Both approaches achieve performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art deep learning models across three clinical tasks. The combination provides interpretability at multiple levels and enables human-explainable biomarker discovery and pathology localization.

Conclusion: The proposed radiomic fingerprints and healthy personas offer an effective framework for accurate and interpretable knee MRI analysis, bridging the gap between traditional radiomics and black-box deep learning approaches for clinical adoption.

Abstract: For automated assessment of knee MRI scans, both accuracy and interpretability are essential for clinical use and adoption. Traditional radiomics rely on predefined features chosen at the population level; while more interpretable, they are often too restrictive to capture patient-specific variability and can underperform end-to-end deep learning (DL). To address this, we propose two complementary strategies that bring individuality and interpretability: radiomic fingerprints and healthy personas. First, a radiomic fingerprint is a dynamically constructed, patient-specific feature set derived from MRI. Instead of applying a uniform population-level signature, our model predicts feature relevance from a pool of candidate features and selects only those most predictive for each patient, while maintaining feature-level interpretability. This fingerprint can be viewed as a latent-variable model of feature usage, where an image-conditioned predictor estimates usage probabilities and a transparent logistic regression with global coefficients performs classification. Second, a healthy persona synthesises a pathology-free baseline for each patient using a diffusion model trained to reconstruct healthy knee MRIs. Comparing features extracted from pathological images against their personas highlights deviations from normal anatomy, enabling intuitive, case-specific explanations of disease manifestations. We systematically compare fingerprints, personas, and their combination across three clinical tasks. Experimental results show that both approaches yield performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art DL models, while supporting interpretability at multiple levels. Case studies further illustrate how these perspectives facilitate human-explainable biomarker discovery and pathology localisation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFDA methods struggle with balancing perception field and computational efficiency in domain-invariant feature learning. Visual Mamba shows promise but lacks channel-wise frequency capture and spatial robustness for domain alignment under significant domain shifts.

Method: Proposes SfMamba with two key components: 1) Channel-wise Visual State-Space block for channel-sequence scanning to extract domain-invariant features, and 2) Semantic-Consistent Shuffle strategy that disrupts background patch sequences in 2D selective scan while preserving prediction consistency to mitigate error accumulation.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks show SfMamba achieves consistently stronger performance than existing methods while maintaining favorable parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: SfMamba offers a practical solution for SFDA by effectively addressing the limitations of existing approaches through Mamba-based architecture with channel-wise scanning and semantic-preserving shuffle strategies.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) tackles the critical challenge of adapting source-pretrained models to unlabeled target domains without access to source data, overcoming data privacy and storage limitations in real-world applications. However, existing SFDA approaches struggle with the trade-off between perception field and computational efficiency in domain-invariant feature learning. Recently, Mamba has offered a promising solution through its selective scan mechanism, which enables long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity. However, the Visual Mamba (i.e., VMamba) remains limited in capturing channel-wise frequency characteristics critical for domain alignment and maintaining spatial robustness under significant domain shifts. To address these, we propose a framework called SfMamba to fully explore the stable dependency in source-free model transfer. SfMamba introduces Channel-wise Visual State-Space block that enables channel-sequence scanning for domain-invariant feature extraction. In addition, SfMamba involves a Semantic-Consistent Shuffle strategy that disrupts background patch sequences in 2D selective scan while preserving prediction consistency to mitigate error accumulation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that SfMamba achieves consistently stronger performance than existing methods while maintaining favorable parameter efficiency, offering a practical solution for SFDA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SoC improves VLM calibration by enforcing smooth prototype separation while preserving semantic relationships, unlike prior orthogonal methods that push related classes apart and cause overconfidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are increasingly used in critical decision-making systems (healthcare, autonomous driving), making uncertainty calibration crucial. However, current test-time prompt-tuning literature focuses mainly on discriminative performance, neglecting calibration. Existing orthogonal methods push semantically related classes apart, causing overconfidence.

Method: Proposes Semantic Orthogonal Calibration (SoC), a Huber-based regularizer that enforces smooth prototype separation while preserving semantic proximity. Unlike full orthogonality constraints that strongly push related classes away, SoC maintains semantic relationships while improving calibration.

Result: SoC consistently improves calibration performance across comprehensive empirical validation while maintaining competitive discriminative capabilities compared to prior orthogonality-based approaches.

Conclusion: Semantic Orthogonal Calibration effectively addresses the calibration problem in VLM test-time prompt-tuning by balancing prototype separation with semantic preservation, overcoming the overconfidence issues of fully orthogonal methods.

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of vision-language models (VLMs) in critical decision-making systems such as healthcare or autonomous driving, the calibration of their uncertainty estimates becomes paramount. Yet, this dimension has been largely underexplored in the VLM test-time prompt-tuning (TPT) literature, which has predominantly focused on improving their discriminative performance. Recent state-of-the-art advocates for enforcing full orthogonality over pairs of text prompt embeddings to enhance separability, and therefore calibration. Nevertheless, as we theoretically show in this work, the inherent gradients from fully orthogonal constraints will strongly push semantically related classes away, ultimately making the model overconfident. Based on our findings, we propose Semantic Orthogonal Calibration (SoC), a Huber-based regularizer that enforces smooth prototype separation while preserving semantic proximity, thereby improving calibration compared to prior orthogonality-based approaches. Across a comprehensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that SoC consistently improves calibration performance, while also maintaining competitive discriminative capabilities.

*Yiming Sun,Yuan Ruan,Qinghua Hu,Pengfei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CtrlFuse is a controllable infrared-visible image fusion framework that enables interactive dynamic fusion guided by mask prompts, achieving mutual enhancement between task performance and fusion quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fusion methods either focus only on pixel-level fusion without considering downstream task adaptability, or use rigid semantics through cascaded detection/segmentation models that cannot interactively address diverse semantic target perception needs.

Method: Proposes CtrlFuse with three components: multi-modal feature extractor, reference prompt encoder (RPE) that dynamically encodes task-specific semantic prompts using pre-trained segmentation models with mask guidance, and prompt-semantic fusion module (PSFM) that explicitly injects these semantics into fusion features. Uses synergistic optimization of parallel segmentation and fusion branches.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in both fusion controllability and segmentation accuracy. The adapted task branch even outperforms the original segmentation model.

Conclusion: CtrlFuse provides an effective controllable fusion framework that enables interactive dynamic fusion guided by mask prompts, achieving mutual enhancement between task performance and fusion quality for intelligent unmanned systems.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion generates all-weather perception-capable images by combining complementary modalities, enhancing environmental awareness for intelligent unmanned systems. Existing methods either focus on pixel-level fusion while overlooking downstream task adaptability or implicitly learn rigid semantics through cascaded detection/segmentation models, unable to interactively address diverse semantic target perception needs. We propose CtrlFuse, a controllable image fusion framework that enables interactive dynamic fusion guided by mask prompts. The model integrates a multi-modal feature extractor, a reference prompt encoder (RPE), and a prompt-semantic fusion module (PSFM). The RPE dynamically encodes task-specific semantic prompts by fine-tuning pre-trained segmentation models with input mask guidance, while the PSFM explicitly injects these semantics into fusion features. Through synergistic optimization of parallel segmentation and fusion branches, our method achieves mutual enhancement between task performance and fusion quality. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in both fusion controllability and segmentation accuracy, with the adapted task branch even outperforming the original segmentation model.

*Renyang Liu,Kangjie Chen,Han Qiu,Jie Zhang,Kwok-Yan Lam,Tianwei Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeRedir is a lightweight inference-time framework that redirects unsafe prompts to safe semantic regions in image generation models without modifying the underlying model, achieving robust unlearning with high preservation of benign content quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image generation models often memorize undesirable concepts from training data (NSFW content, copyrighted styles), posing safety/compliance risks. Post-hoc filtering is unreliable, and existing unlearning methods require costly retraining, degrade quality, or fail against adversarial attacks.

Method: SafeRedir uses prompt embedding redirection at inference time: 1) latent-aware multi-modal safety classifier to identify unsafe generation trajectories, 2) token-level delta generator for precise semantic redirection with auxiliary predictors for token masking and adaptive scaling to localize/regulate interventions.

Result: Achieves effective unlearning capability, high semantic/perceptual preservation, robust image quality, and enhanced resistance to adversarial attacks. Generalizes across various diffusion backbones and existing unlearned models with plug-and-play compatibility.

Conclusion: SafeRedir provides a lightweight, robust inference-time solution for unlearning harmful concepts in image generation models without model modification, addressing limitations of existing methods while maintaining generation quality and adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Image generation models (IGMs), while capable of producing impressive and creative content, often memorize a wide range of undesirable concepts from their training data, leading to the reproduction of unsafe content such as NSFW imagery and copyrighted artistic styles. Such behaviors pose persistent safety and compliance risks in real-world deployments and cannot be reliably mitigated by post-hoc filtering, owing to the limited robustness of such mechanisms and a lack of fine-grained semantic control. Recent unlearning methods seek to erase harmful concepts at the model level, which exhibit the limitations of requiring costly retraining, degrading the quality of benign generations, or failing to withstand prompt paraphrasing and adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeRedir, a lightweight inference-time framework for robust unlearning via prompt embedding redirection. Without modifying the underlying IGMs, SafeRedir adaptively routes unsafe prompts toward safe semantic regions through token-level interventions in the embedding space. The framework comprises two core components: a latent-aware multi-modal safety classifier for identifying unsafe generation trajectories, and a token-level delta generator for precise semantic redirection, equipped with auxiliary predictors for token masking and adaptive scaling to localize and regulate the intervention. Empirical results across multiple representative unlearning tasks demonstrate that SafeRedir achieves effective unlearning capability, high semantic and perceptual preservation, robust image quality, and enhanced resistance to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, SafeRedir generalizes effectively across a variety of diffusion backbones and existing unlearned models, validating its plug-and-play compatibility and broad applicability. Code and data are available at https://github.com/ryliu68/SafeRedir.

TL;DR: Salience-SGG introduces an Iterative Salience Decoder to address Scene Graph Generation's long-tailed distribution problem by focusing on spatially salient triplets, improving spatial understanding without sacrificing semantic priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGG suffers from long-tailed distribution where few predicate classes dominate, causing biased models that underperform on rare relations. Existing Unbiased-SGG methods often sacrifice spatial understanding for debiasing, leading to over-reliance on semantic priors.

Method: Proposes Salience-SGG framework with Iterative Salience Decoder (ISD) that emphasizes triplets with salient spatial structures. Uses semantic-agnostic salience labels to guide ISD, focusing on spatial understanding rather than semantic biases.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Visual Genome, Open Images V6, and GQA-200 datasets. Improves existing Unbiased-SGG methods in spatial understanding as measured by Pairwise Localization Average Precision.

Conclusion: Salience-SGG effectively addresses the long-tailed distribution problem in SGG by prioritizing spatially salient relationships, balancing debiasing with spatial understanding, and outperforming existing methods across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) suffers from a long-tailed distribution, where a few predicate classes dominate while many others are underrepresented, leading to biased models that underperform on rare relations. Unbiased-SGG methods address this issue by implementing debiasing strategies, but often at the cost of spatial understanding, resulting in an over-reliance on semantic priors. We introduce Salience-SGG, a novel framework featuring an Iterative Salience Decoder (ISD) that emphasizes triplets with salient spatial structures. To support this, we propose semantic-agnostic salience labels guiding ISD. Evaluations on Visual Genome, Open Images V6, and GQA-200 show that Salience-SGG achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves existing Unbiased-SGG methods in their spatial understanding as demonstrated by the Pairwise Localization Average Precision

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for acute ischemic stroke lesion segmentation lack clear optimal configurations, many implementations are not publicly available, and there's a need for robust, generalizable solutions that can handle multicenter data.

Method: Developed ISLA through systematic optimization of loss function, convolutional architecture, deep supervision, and attention mechanisms. Trained on three multicenter databases (1500+ participants) and investigated unsupervised domain adaptation for better generalization to external clinical data.

Result: ISLA outperformed two state-of-the-art approaches for AIS lesion segmentation on an external test set, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capability.

Conclusion: ISLA provides a robust segmentation framework for acute ischemic stroke lesions with publicly available code and models to facilitate reproducibility and clinical adoption.

Abstract: Accurate delineation of acute ischemic stroke lesions in MRI is a key component of stroke diagnosis and management. In recent years, deep learning models have been successfully applied to the automatic segmentation of such lesions. While most proposed architectures are based on the U-Net framework, they primarily differ in their choice of loss functions and in the use of deep supervision, residual connections, and attention mechanisms. Moreover, many implementations are not publicly available, and the optimal configuration for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) lesion segmentation remains unclear. In this work, we introduce ISLA (Ischemic Stroke Lesion Analyzer), a new deep learning model for AIS lesion segmentation from diffusion MRI, trained on three multicenter databases totaling more than 1500 AIS participants. Through systematic optimization of the loss function, convolutional architecture, deep supervision, and attention mechanisms, we developed a robust segmentation framework. We further investigated unsupervised domain adaptation to improve generalization to an external clinical dataset. ISLA outperformed two state-of-the-art approaches for AIS lesion segmentation on an external test set. Codes and trained models will be made publicly available to facilitate reuse and reproducibility.

Motivation: Existing VQA benchmarks use medium-resolution images with limited visual complexity, leaving MLLMs' performance on ultra-high-resolution imagery unexplored.

Method: Created UR-Bench with two categories (Humanistic/Natural Scenes) across four subsets of ultra-high-resolution images. Proposed agent-based framework where LLM invokes external visual tools, including Semantic Abstraction and Retrieval tools for efficient processing.

Result: Benchmark enables evaluation of MLLMs' reasoning capabilities in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. Agent-based framework demonstrates effectiveness compared to end-to-end MLLMs.

Conclusion: UR-Bench addresses the gap in evaluating MLLMs on ultra-high-resolution imagery and provides a framework for more efficient processing of such complex visual data.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong capabilities in visual-language reasoning, yet their performance on ultra-high-resolution imagery remains largely unexplored. Existing visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks typically rely on medium-resolution data, offering limited visual complexity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Ultra-high-resolution Reasoning Benchmark (UR-Bench), a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs under extreme visual information. UR-Bench comprises two major categories, Humanistic Scenes and Natural Scenes, covering four subsets of ultra-high-resolution images with distinct spatial structures and data sources. Each subset contains images ranging from hundreds of megapixels to gigapixels, accompanied by questions organized into three levels, enabling evaluation of models' reasoning capabilities in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. We further propose an agent-based framework in which a language model performs reasoning by invoking external visual tools. In addition, we introduce Semantic Abstraction and Retrieval tools that enable more efficient processing of ultra-high-resolution images. We evaluate state-of-the-art models using both an end-to-end MLLMs and our agent-based framework, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fluorescence microscopy provides complementary information to standard H&E staining in histopathology, but converting fluorescence images to H&E-like appearance would aid interpretation and integration with existing clinical workflows familiar to pathologists.

Method: Uses Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) for unpaired image-to-image translation. Combines C01 and C02 fluorescence channels into RGB format, learns bidirectional mapping between fluorescence and H&E domains without paired training data. Architecture employs ResNet-based generators with residual blocks and PatchGAN discriminators, trained with adversarial, cycle-consistency, and identity losses.

Result: The model generates realistic pseudo H&E images that preserve morphological structures while adopting H&E-like color characteristics. Experiments on fluorescence microscopy datasets demonstrate successful translation that maintains structural information while achieving desired color transformation.

Conclusion: The approach enables visualization of fluorescence microscopy data in a format familiar to pathologists and supports integration with existing H&E-based analysis pipelines, bridging the gap between fluorescence imaging and standard histopathology workflows.

*Lei Tan,Shuwei Li,Mohan Kankanhalli,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCAN is a multi-cue aggregation network that integrates spatial, frequency-domain, and chromaticity cues for AI-generated image detection, achieving state-of-the-art cross-model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated image detectors often overfit to model-specific features and struggle with generalization as new image synthesis models rapidly emerge. There's a need for more robust detection methods that can generalize across different AI models.

Method: MCAN integrates three complementary cues: 1) input image for overall content, 2) high-frequency components for edge details, and 3) Chromatic Inconsistency (CI) cue that normalizes intensity values to capture noise patterns from real image acquisition. These cues are processed through a mixture-of-encoders adapter for dynamic feature representation.

Result: MCAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenImage, Chameleon, and UniversalFakeDetect benchmarks. On GenImage, it outperforms the best existing method by up to 7.4% in average accuracy across eight different image generators.

Conclusion: The unified multi-cue aggregation framework effectively integrates spatial, frequency-domain, and chromaticity information to create more robust and generalizable AI-generated image detectors that work across different synthesis models.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of image synthesis models poses challenges to the generalization of AI-generated image detectors. However, existing methods often rely on model-specific features, leading to overfitting and poor generalization. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Cue Aggregation Network (MCAN), a novel framework that integrates different yet complementary cues in a unified network. MCAN employs a mixture-of-encoders adapter to dynamically process these cues, enabling more adaptive and robust feature representation. Our cues include the input image itself, which represents the overall content, and high-frequency components that emphasize edge details. Additionally, we introduce a Chromatic Inconsistency (CI) cue, which normalizes intensity values and captures noise information introduced during the image acquisition process in real images, making these noise patterns more distinguishable from those in AI-generated content. Unlike prior methods, MCAN's novelty lies in its unified multi-cue aggregation framework, which integrates spatial, frequency-domain, and chromaticity-based information for enhanced representation learning. These cues are intrinsically more indicative of real images, enhancing cross-model generalization. Extensive experiments on the GenImage, Chameleon, and UniversalFakeDetect benchmark validate the state-of-the-art performance of MCAN. In the GenImage dataset, MCAN outperforms the best state-of-the-art method by up to 7.4% in average ACC across eight different image generators.

Motivation: Dental disease diagnosis from radiographs is challenging due to subtle visual evidence. Existing object detection models designed for natural images with distinct patterns struggle with dental diseases that have far less visual support.

Method: Proposes DentalX with a structural context extraction module that learns semantic segmentation of dental anatomy as an auxiliary task. This extracts meaningful structural context and integrates it into the primary disease detection task to enhance detection of subtle dental diseases.

Result: Extensive experiments on a dedicated benchmark demonstrate that DentalX significantly outperforms prior methods in both disease detection and segmentation tasks. The mutual benefit arises naturally during model optimization as the correlation between tasks is effectively captured.

Conclusion: DentalX effectively leverages oral structure information to mitigate visual ambiguity in radiographs, providing a novel context-aware approach for dental disease detection that addresses the limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Diagnosing dental diseases from radiographs is time-consuming and challenging due to the subtle nature of diagnostic evidence. Existing methods, which rely on object detection models designed for natural images with more distinct target patterns, struggle to detect dental diseases that present with far less visual support. To address this challenge, we propose {\bf DentalX}, a novel context-aware dental disease detection approach that leverages oral structure information to mitigate the visual ambiguity inherent in radiographs. Specifically, we introduce a structural context extraction module that learns an auxiliary task: semantic segmentation of dental anatomy. The module extracts meaningful structural context and integrates it into the primary disease detection task to enhance the detection of subtle dental diseases. Extensive experiments on a dedicated benchmark demonstrate that DentalX significantly outperforms prior methods in both tasks. This mutual benefit arises naturally during model optimization, as the correlation between the two tasks is effectively captured. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhiqin1998/DentYOLOX.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Computer vision methods for photographic re-identification of endangered Hula painted frogs show that zero-shot deep local-feature matching outperforms global-feature models, achieving 98% accuracy. A two-stage workflow combining both approaches reduces processing time from hours to minutes while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate individual identification is crucial for monitoring rare amphibians, but invasive marking methods are unsuitable for critically endangered species. There's a need for non-invasive photographic re-identification techniques to support conservation monitoring and capture-recapture analyses.

Method: Evaluated computer-vision methods using 1,233 ventral images from 191 Hula painted frogs collected during 2013-2020. Compared deep local-feature matching in zero-shot setting with deep global-feature embedding models. Implemented a two-stage workflow where a fine-tuned global-feature model retrieves candidate lists that are re-ranked by local-feature matching.

Result: Local-feature pipeline achieved 98% top-1 closed-set identification accuracy, outperforming all global-feature models. Fine-tuning improved best global-feature model to 60% top-1 (91% top-10). Two-stage workflow reduced runtime from 6.5-7.8 hours to ~38 minutes while maintaining ~96% top-1 accuracy. Match score separation enables open-set identification for novel individuals.

Conclusion: Zero-shot deep local-feature matching provides superior performance for amphibian photo-identification compared to global-feature approaches. The developed two-stage pipeline offers a practical, scalable solution for conservation monitoring, deployed as a web application for field use.

Abstract: Accurate individual identification is essential for monitoring rare amphibians, yet invasive marking is often unsuitable for critically endangered species. We evaluate state-of-the-art computer-vision methods for photographic re-identification of the Hula painted frog (Latonia nigriventer) using 1,233 ventral images from 191 individuals collected during 2013-2020 capture-recapture surveys. We compare deep local-feature matching in a zero-shot setting with deep global-feature embedding models. The local-feature pipeline achieves 98% top-1 closed-set identification accuracy, outperforming all global-feature models; fine-tuning improves the best global-feature model to 60% top-1 (91% top-10) but remains below local matching. To combine scalability with accuracy, we implement a two-stage workflow in which a fine-tuned global-feature model retrieves a short candidate list that is re-ranked by local-feature matching, reducing end-to-end runtime from 6.5-7.8 hours to ~38 minutes while maintaining ~96% top-1 closed-set accuracy on the labeled dataset. Separation of match scores between same- and different-individual pairs supports thresholding for open-set identification, enabling practical handling of novel individuals. We deploy this pipeline as a web application for routine field use, providing rapid, standardized, non-invasive identification to support conservation monitoring and capture-recapture analyses. Overall, in this species, zero-shot deep local-feature matching outperformed global-feature embedding and provides a strong default for photo-identification.

Motivation: Current 3D visual grounding models have limited reasoning ability and require extensive supervised training data. Existing synthetic data approaches show limited performance gains relative to their high data collection costs.

Method: Develops an automated pipeline for synthesizing 3D visual grounding data with corresponding reasoning processes, then uses this generated data to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) for 3D visual grounding.

Result: The resulting model, Reason3DVG-8B, outperforms the previous LLM-based method 3D-GRAND while using only 1.6% of their training data, demonstrating both the effectiveness of the synthetic data and the importance of reasoning in 3D visual grounding.

Conclusion: Automated synthesis of 3D visual grounding data with reasoning processes enables efficient training of strong 3D visual grounding LLMs, highlighting the critical role of reasoning in 3D understanding tasks.

Abstract: The recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning ability has driven research in various domains such as mathematics, coding, and scientific discovery. Meanwhile, 3D visual grounding, as a fundamental task in 3D understanding, still remains challenging due to the limited reasoning ability of recent 3D visual grounding models. Most of the current methods incorporate a text encoder and visual feature encoder to generate cross-modal fuse features and predict the referring object. These models often require supervised training on extensive 3D annotation data. On the other hand, recent research also focus on scaling synthetic data to train stronger 3D visual grounding LLM, however, the performance gain remains limited and non-proportional to the data collection cost. In this work, we propose a 3D visual grounding data pipeline, which is capable of automatically synthesizing 3D visual grounding data along with corresponding reasoning process. Additionally, we leverage the generated data for LLM fine-tuning and introduce Reason3DVG-8B, a strong 3D visual grounding LLM that outperforms previous LLM-based method 3D-GRAND using only 1.6% of their training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data and the importance of reasoning in 3D visual grounding.

Abstract: Video object segmentation methods like SAM2 achieve strong performance through memory-based architectures but struggle under large viewpoint changes due to reliance on appearance features. Traditional 3D instance segmentation methods address viewpoint consistency but require camera poses, depth maps, and expensive preprocessing. We introduce 3AM, a training-time enhancement that integrates 3D-aware features from MUSt3R into SAM2. Our lightweight Feature Merger fuses multi-level MUSt3R features that encode implicit geometric correspondence. Combined with SAM2's appearance features, the model achieves geometry-consistent recognition grounded in both spatial position and visual similarity. We propose a field-of-view aware sampling strategy ensuring frames observe spatially consistent object regions for reliable 3D correspondence learning. Critically, our method requires only RGB input at inference, with no camera poses or preprocessing. On challenging datasets with wide-baseline motion (ScanNet++, Replica), 3AM substantially outperforms SAM2 and extensions, achieving 90.6% IoU and 71.7% Positive IoU on ScanNet++'s Selected Subset, improving over state-of-the-art VOS methods by +15.9 and +30.4 points.

*Fahad Shamshad,Nils Lukas,Karthik Nandakumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot diffusion framework removes invisible watermarks by treating watermark removal as a view synthesis problem, outperforming 14 baseline attacks across 15 watermarking methods while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As invisible watermarking becomes widely deployed for AI-generated content authentication, there's a critical need to evaluate their vulnerability against sophisticated removal attacks to assess reliability and guide robust design.

Method: Reformulates watermark removal as view synthesis problem. Uses zero-shot diffusion framework with controlled geometric transformations in latent space, augmented with view-guided correspondence attention to maintain structural consistency during reconstruction. Operates on frozen pre-trained models without detector access or watermark knowledge.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art watermark suppression across 15 watermarking methods, outperforming 14 baseline attacks while maintaining superior perceptual quality across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Reveals fundamental vulnerability: watermarks robust to pixel-space and frequency-domain attacks remain vulnerable to semantic-preserving viewpoint transformations, exposing a critical gap in current watermarking schemes.

Abstract: Invisible watermarking has become a critical mechanism for authenticating AI-generated image content, with major platforms deploying watermarking schemes at scale. However, evaluating the vulnerability of these schemes against sophisticated removal attacks remains essential to assess their reliability and guide robust design. In this work, we expose a fundamental vulnerability in invisible watermarks by reformulating watermark removal as a view synthesis problem. Our key insight is that generating a perceptually consistent alternative view of the same semantic content, akin to re-observing a scene from a shifted perspective, naturally removes the embedded watermark while preserving visual fidelity. This reveals a critical gap: watermarks robust to pixel-space and frequency-domain attacks remain vulnerable to semantic-preserving viewpoint transformations. We introduce a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that applies controlled geometric transformations in latent space, augmented with view-guided correspondence attention to maintain structural consistency during reconstruction. Operating on frozen pre-trained models without detector access or watermark knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art watermark suppression across 15 watermarking methods--outperforming 14 baseline attacks while maintaining superior perceptual quality across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed contact-aware path planner enables efficient and accurate neurovascular navigation by intelligently predicting tool-anatomy interactions, demonstrating clinical viability for most patient anatomies.

Abstract: We propose a deterministic and time-efficient contact-aware path planner for neurovascular navigation. The algorithm leverages information from pre- and intra-operative images of the vessels to navigate pre-bent passive tools, by intelligently predicting and exploiting interactions with the anatomy. A kinematic model is derived and employed by the sampling-based planner for tree expansion that utilizes simplified motion primitives.

### [99] [Fiducial Exoskeletons: Image-Centric Robot State Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08034)
*Cameron Smith,Basile Van Hoorick,Vitor Guizilini,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Fiducial Exoskeletons: A simple image-based method for 3D robot state estimation using fiducial markers on robot links to estimate poses and joint angles from single RGB images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robot state estimation requires complex calibration procedures and high-precision hardware, while modern learning-based control uses simpler RGB observations. The paper aims to bridge this gap by creating a simple, robust method for robot state estimation from single images.

Method: Two-part approach: 1) Cast robot state estimation as 6D pose estimation of each link from single RGB images, obtaining robot-camera transform directly from base-link pose and recovering joint state via kinematic consistency optimization. 2) Use "fiducial exoskeleton" - 3D-printed mounts with fiducial markers on each link with known marker-link geometry for robust pose estimation without learning.

Result: Demonstrated on low-cost robot arm, the method simplifies setup while improving calibration accuracy, state estimation, and downstream 3D control performance. Enables robust state estimation even on unplugged robots.

Conclusion: Fiducial exoskeletons provide a practical, hardware-algorithm co-design solution that substantially simplifies robot state estimation setup while maintaining or improving performance compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: We introduce Fiducial Exoskeletons, an image-based reformulation of 3D robot state estimation that replaces cumbersome procedures and motor-centric pipelines with single-image inference. Traditional approaches - especially robot-camera extrinsic estimation - often rely on high-precision actuators and require time-consuming routines such as hand-eye calibration. In contrast, modern learning-based robot control is increasingly trained and deployed from RGB observations on lower-cost hardware.
  Our key insight is twofold. First, we cast robot state estimation as 6D pose estimation of each link from a single RGB image: the robot-camera base transform is obtained directly as the estimated base-link pose, and the joint state is recovered via a lightweight global optimization that enforces kinematic consistency with the observed link poses (optionally warm-started with encoder readings). Second, we make per-link 6D pose estimation robust and simple - even without learning - by introducing the fiducial exoskeleton: a lightweight 3D-printed mount with a fiducial marker on each link and known marker-link geometry.
  This design yields robust camera-robot extrinsics, per-link SE(3) poses, and joint-angle state from a single image, enabling robust state estimation even on unplugged robots. Demonstrated on a low-cost robot arm, fiducial exoskeletons substantially simplify setup while improving calibration, state accuracy, and downstream 3D control performance. We release code and printable hardware designs to enable further algorithm-hardware co-design.

### [100] [Efficient Incremental SLAM via Information-Guided and Selective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08110)
*Reza Arablouei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Efficient incremental SLAM back-end combining information-guided gating and selective partial optimization to achieve batch optimization accuracy with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for real-time SLAM systems that maintain global consistency and accuracy while being computationally efficient in dynamic, data-rich environments.

Method: Combines two techniques: 1) Information-Guided Gating (IGG) - uses information-theoretic criterion to trigger global optimization only when significant information gain occurs, avoiding unnecessary computations. 2) Selective Partial Optimization (SPO) - performs multi-iteration Gauss-Newton updates but restricts optimization to subsets of variables most affected by new measurements, dynamically refining the active set.

Result: Approach matches batch solver accuracy while achieving significant computational savings compared to conventional incremental methods, with theoretical convergence guarantees preserved.

Conclusion: Provides principled balance between accuracy and efficiency, offering robust and scalable solution for real-time SLAM in dynamic environments.

Abstract: We present an efficient incremental SLAM back-end that achieves the accuracy of full batch optimization while substantially reducing computational cost. The proposed approach combines two complementary ideas: information-guided gating (IGG) and selective partial optimization (SPO). IGG employs an information-theoretic criterion based on the log-determinant of the information matrix to quantify the contribution of new measurements, triggering global optimization only when a significant information gain is observed. This avoids unnecessary relinearization and factorization when incoming data provide little additional information. SPO executes multi-iteration Gauss-Newton (GN) updates but restricts each iteration to the subset of variables most affected by the new measurements, dynamically refining this active set until convergence. Together, these mechanisms retain all measurements to preserve global consistency while focusing computation on parts of the graph where it yields the greatest benefit. We provide theoretical analysis showing that the proposed approach maintains the convergence guarantees of full GN. Extensive experiments on benchmark SLAM datasets show that our approach consistently matches the estimation accuracy of batch solvers, while achieving significant computational savings compared to conventional incremental approaches. The results indicate that the proposed approach offers a principled balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it a robust and scalable solution for real-time operation in dynamic data-rich environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-limbed climbing robots in extreme environments (cliffs, cave walls) often fail due to misgrasping or loss of graspable points in unknown natural terrains. Current grippers lack both adaptive grasping and accurate terrain shape measurement capabilities.

Method: Developed a gripper with pin-array structure that can grasp both convex and concave terrains while simultaneously measuring terrain shape. The pin-array design enables both adaptive grasping and 3D terrain mapping.

Result: Demonstrated the gripper mechanism and evaluated grasping and terrain recognition performance using a prototype. The pin-array design works effectively for both 3D terrain mapping and adaptive grasping on irregular terrains.

Conclusion: The proposed gripper with pin-array structure successfully addresses the challenges of grasping and terrain recognition in extreme environments, enabling more reliable navigation for climbing robots on irregular natural surfaces.

Abstract: This paper presents a gripper capable of grasping and recognizing terrain shapes for mobile robots in extreme environments. Multi-limbed climbing robots with grippers are effective on rough terrains, such as cliffs and cave walls. However, such robots may fall over by misgrasping the surface or getting stuck owing to the loss of graspable points in unknown natural environments. To overcome these issues, we need a gripper capable of adaptive grasping to irregular terrains, not only for grasping but also for measuring the shape of the terrain surface accurately. We developed a gripper that can grasp both convex and concave terrains and simultaneously measure the terrain shape by introducing a pin-array structure. We demonstrated the mechanism of the gripper and evaluated its grasping and terrain recognition performance using a prototype. Moreover, the proposed pin-array design works well for 3D terrain mapping as well as adaptive grasping for irregular terrains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-cost INS systems suffer from sensor biases and noise that cause rapid accuracy degradation during GPS outages, creating a need for improved positioning continuity in GPS-denied environments.

Method: BGFN integrates spiking Transformer with spiking encoder to extract spatial features from IMU signals and capture temporal dynamics, modeling relationships between vehicle attitude, specific force, angular rate, and GPS-derived position increments.

Result: Real-world field tests and public dataset experiments show BGFN achieves higher accuracy and enhanced reliability compared to conventional deep learning approaches, especially under prolonged GPS outages.

Conclusion: The brain-inspired SNN-based approach effectively improves GPS/INS fusion performance, offering better navigation continuity in GPS-denied environments through superior spatial-temporal feature extraction.

Abstract: Low-cost inertial navigation systems (INS) are prone to sensor biases and measurement noise, which lead to rapid degradation of navigation accuracy during global positioning system (GPS) outages. To address this challenge and improve positioning continuity in GPS-denied environments, this paper proposes a brain-inspired GPS/INS fusion network (BGFN) based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). The BGFN architecture integrates a spiking Transformer with a spiking encoder to simultaneously extract spatial features from inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals and capture their temporal dynamics. By modeling the relationship between vehicle attitude, specific force, angular rate, and GPS-derived position increments, the network leverages both current and historical IMU data to estimate vehicle motion. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through real-world field tests and experiments on public datasets. Compared to conventional deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate that BGFN achieves higher accuracy and enhanced reliability in navigation performance, particularly under prolonged GPS outages.

*Yifan Han,Pengfei Yi,Junyan Li,Hanqing Wang,Gaojing Zhang,Qi Peng Liu,Wenzhao Lian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A data-efficient framework for dexterous grasp synthesis that uses pretrained diffusion models and human video demonstrations to generate hardware-agnostic grasps without per-hand training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dexterous grasp synthesis is challenging due to high dimensionality and kinematic diversity of multi-fingered hands. Existing approaches require large, hardware-specific datasets collected through expensive simulation or real-world trials, which doesn't scale well as new hand designs emerge.

Method: 1) Extract temporally aligned grasp affordances from human video demonstrations using pretrained generative diffusion models; 2) Fuse with 3D scene geometry from depth images to infer semantically grounded contact targets; 3) Use kinematics-aware retargeting module to map affordances to diverse dexterous hands without per-hand retraining.

Result: Produces stable, functionally appropriate multi-contact grasps that work reliably across common objects and tools. Shows strong generalization across unseen object instances within categories, pose variations, and multiple hand embodiments. Works with only depth modality when coupled with foundation-model semantics.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a path toward scalable, hardware-agnostic dexterous manipulation using human demonstrations and pretrained generative models, eliminating need for hardware-specific grasp datasets and enabling cross-hand generalization.

Abstract: Dexterous grasp synthesis remains a central challenge: the high dimensionality and kinematic diversity of multi-fingered hands prevent direct transfer of algorithms developed for parallel-jaw grippers. Existing approaches typically depend on large, hardware-specific grasp datasets collected in simulation or through costly real-world trials, hindering scalability as new dexterous hand designs emerge. To this end, we propose a data-efficient framework, which is designed to bypass robot grasp data collection by exploiting the rich, object-centric semantic priors latent in pretrained generative diffusion models. Temporally aligned and fine-grained grasp affordances are extracted from raw human video demonstrations and fused with 3D scene geometry from depth images to infer semantically grounded contact targets. A kinematics-aware retargeting module then maps these affordance representations to diverse dexterous hands without per-hand retraining. The resulting system produces stable, functionally appropriate multi-contact grasps that remain reliably successful across common objects and tools, while exhibiting strong generalization across previously unseen object instances within a category, pose variations, and multiple hand embodiments. This work (i) introduces a semantic affordance extraction pipeline leveraging vision-language generative priors for dexterous grasping, (ii) demonstrates cross-hand generalization without constructing hardware-specific grasp datasets, and (iii) establishes that a single depth modality suffices for high-performance grasp synthesis when coupled with foundation-model semantics. Our results highlight a path toward scalable, hardware-agnostic dexterous manipulation driven by human demonstrations and pretrained generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-cost IMUs are widely used for mobile robot localization but suffer from complex nonlinear noise characteristics that degrade dead reckoning accuracy, requiring more robust estimation methods.

Method: Combines spiking neural network (SNN) with invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF). SNN extracts motion features from noisy IMU sequences and dynamically adapts covariance noise parameters in InEKF via surrogate gradient descent training.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on KITTI dataset and real-world mobile robot data, showing improved localization accuracy and strong robustness to sensor noise.

Conclusion: The brain-inspired SNN-InEKF framework effectively enhances pose estimation robustness and accuracy for low-cost IMUs, demonstrating practical potential for real-world mobile robot applications.

Abstract: Low-cost inertial measurement units (IMUs) are widely utilized in mobile robot localization due to their affordability and ease of integration. However, their complex, nonlinear, and time-varying noise characteristics often lead to significant degradation in localization accuracy when applied directly for dead reckoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel brain-inspired state estimation framework that combines a spiking neural network (SNN) with an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF). The SNN is designed to extract motion-related features from long sequences of IMU data affected by substantial random noise and is trained via a surrogate gradient descent algorithm to enable dynamic adaptation of the covariance noise parameter within the InEKF. By fusing the SNN output with raw IMU measurements, the proposed method enhances the robustness and accuracy of pose estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset and real-world data collected using a mobile robot equipped with a low-cost IMU demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization accuracy and exhibits strong robustness to sensor noise, highlighting its potential for real-world mobile robot applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ActiveVLA introduces active perception to vision-language-action models for robots, enabling adaptive viewpoint selection and resolution optimization for fine-grained manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models rely on static, wrist-mounted cameras with end-effector-centric viewpoints, lacking adaptive viewpoint selection and resolution optimization, which limits performance in long-horizon tasks and fine-grained manipulation.

Method: Two-stage coarse-to-fine approach: 1) Critical region localization via multi-view 2D projections and 3D region identification, 2) Active perception optimization using view selection strategy to maximize relevance/diversity while minimizing occlusions, plus 3D zoom-in for resolution enhancement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three simulation benchmarks, achieves precise 3D manipulation, and transfers seamlessly to real-world scenarios for high-precision tasks in complex environments.

Conclusion: ActiveVLA successfully addresses limitations of static perception in VLA models by enabling active perception capabilities, significantly improving performance in fine-grained manipulation tasks across both simulation and real-world settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in robot manipulation have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) and explored integrating 3D spatial signals into these models for effective action prediction, giving rise to the promising vision-language-action (VLA) paradigm. However, most existing approaches overlook the importance of active perception: they typically rely on static, wrist-mounted cameras that provide an end-effector-centric viewpoint. As a result, these models are unable to adaptively select optimal viewpoints or resolutions during task execution, which significantly limits their performance in long-horizon tasks and fine-grained manipulation scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLA, a novel vision-language-action framework that empowers robots with active perception capabilities for high-precision, fine-grained manipulation. ActiveVLA adopts a coarse-to-fine paradigm, dividing the process into two stages: (1) Critical region localization. ActiveVLA projects 3D inputs onto multi-view 2D projections, identifies critical 3D regions, and supports dynamic spatial awareness. (2) Active perception optimization. Drawing on the localized critical regions, ActiveVLA uses an active view selection strategy to choose optimal viewpoints. These viewpoints aim to maximize amodal relevance and diversity while minimizing occlusions. Additionally, ActiveVLA applies a 3D zoom-in to improve resolution in key areas. Together, these steps enable finer-grained active perception for precise manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActiveVLA achieves precise 3D manipulation and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three simulation benchmarks. Moreover, ActiveVLA transfers seamlessly to real-world scenarios, enabling robots to learn high-precision tasks in complex environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework enabling structurally heterogeneous teams of agents to jointly discover and acquire randomly located targets in environments characterized by partial observability, communication constraints, and dynamic interactions. Each agent's policy is trained with the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm and employs a Graph Attention Network encoder that integrates simulated range-sensing data with communication embeddings exchanged among neighboring agents, enabling context-aware decision-making from both local sensing and relational information. In particular, this work introduces a unified framework that integrates graph-based communication and trajectory-aware safety through safety filters. The architecture is supported by a structured reward formulation designed to encourage effective target discovery and acquisition, collision avoidance, and de-correlation between the agents' communication vectors by promoting informational orthogonality.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to enable legged robots to learn how to interpret human social cues and produce appropriate behaviors through physical human guidance.

We reconstruct interaction scenes using a physics-based simulation and aggregate data to mitigate distributional shifts arising from limited demonstration data. Our progressive goal cueing strategy adaptively feeds appropriate commands and navigation goals during training, leading to more accurate navigation and stronger alignment between human input and robot behavior. We evaluate our framework across six real-world agile navigation scenarios, including jumping over or avoiding obstacles. Our experimental results show that our proposed method succeeds in almost all trials across these scenarios, achieving a 97.15% task success rate with less than 1 hour of demonstration data in total.

Abstract: The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offers a promising technology to tackle the limitations of modular design in autonomous driving, which often falters in open-world scenarios requiring sustained environmental understanding and logical reasoning. Besides, embodied artificial intelligence facilitates policy optimization through closed-loop interactions to achieve the continuous learning capability, thereby advancing autonomous driving toward embodied intelligent (El) driving. However, such capability will be constrained by relying solely on LMMs to enhance EI driving without joint decision-making. This article introduces a novel semantics and policy dual-driven hybrid decision framework to tackle this challenge, ensuring continuous learning and joint decision. The framework merges LMMs for semantic understanding and cognitive representation, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for real-time policy optimization. We starts by introducing the foundational principles of EI driving and LMMs. Moreover, we examine the emerging opportunities this framework enables, encompassing potential benefits and representative use cases. A case study is conducted experimentally to validate the performance superiority of our framework in completing lane-change planning task. Finally, several future research directions to empower EI driving are identified to guide subsequent work.

*Alessandro Adami,Sebastian Zudaire,Ruggero Carli,Pietro Falco*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Autonomous Real2Sim framework uses vision-language models to generate Behavior Trees for task-specific physical parameter estimation, enabling intent-driven simulation construction without pre-defined exploration routines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Real2Sim pipelines rely on manual measurements or fixed exploration routines, limiting adaptability to varying tasks and user intents. There's a need for autonomous, task-specific parameter estimation that bridges high-level reasoning with physical interaction.

Method: Given user request, incomplete simulation description, and RGB observation, a vision-language model performs multi-modal reasoning to identify relevant objects and infer required physical parameters. It generates structured Behavior Trees composed of elementary robotic actions executed on a torque-controlled Franka Emika Panda for compliant, contact-rich interactions. Acquired measurements automatically construct physics-aware simulations.

Result: Experimental results on real manipulator demonstrate successful estimation of object mass, surface height, and friction-related quantities across multiple scenarios, including occluded objects and incomplete prior models.

Conclusion: The approach enables interpretable, intent-driven, and autonomous Real2Sim pipelines that bridge high-level reasoning with physically-grounded robotic interaction, moving beyond traditional manual or template-based methods.

Abstract: Constructing an accurate simulation model of real-world environments requires reliable estimation of physical parameters such as mass, geometry, friction, and contact surfaces. Traditional real-to-simulation (Real2Sim) pipelines rely on manual measurements or fixed, pre-programmed exploration routines, which limit their adaptability to varying tasks and user intents. This paper presents a Real2Sim framework that autonomously generates and executes Behavior Trees for task-specific physical interactions to acquire only the parameters required for a given simulation objective, without relying on pre-defined task templates or expert-designed exploration routines. Given a high-level user request, an incomplete simulation description, and an RGB observation of the scene, a vision-language model performs multi-modal reasoning to identify relevant objects, infer required physical parameters, and generate a structured Behavior Tree composed of elementary robotic actions. The resulting behavior is executed on a torque-controlled Franka Emika Panda, enabling compliant, contact-rich interactions for parameter estimation. The acquired measurements are used to automatically construct a physics-aware simulation. Experimental results on the real manipulator demonstrate estimation of object mass, surface height, and friction-related quantities across multiple scenarios, including occluded objects and incomplete prior models. The proposed approach enables interpretable, intent-driven, and autonomously Real2Sim pipelines, bridging high-level reasoning with physically-grounded robotic interaction.

*Chong Zhang,Victor Klemm,Fan Yang,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AME-2 is a unified RL framework for agile and generalized legged locomotion that combines an attention-based map encoder with a learning-based mapping pipeline to handle occlusions and sparse footholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either achieve agility but lack generalization and interpretability (end-to-end sensorimotor models), or target generalization but exhibit limited agility and struggle with visual occlusions. There's a need for a unified approach that combines agility, generalization, and robustness to occlusions.

Method: 1) Attention-based map encoder in control policy that extracts local/global mapping features using attention mechanisms to focus on salient regions. 2) Learning-based mapping pipeline that provides fast, uncertainty-aware terrain representations robust to noise/occlusions, converting depth observations into local elevations with uncertainties and fusing with odometry. 3) Integration with parallel simulation for training controllers with online mapping to aid sim-to-real transfer.

Result: Validated on quadruped and biped robots, demonstrating strong agility and generalization to unseen terrains in both simulation and real-world experiments. The controllers handle occlusions and sparse footholds effectively.

Conclusion: AME-2 successfully integrates perception and control for agile and generalized legged locomotion, addressing limitations of existing methods through its attention-based map encoder and uncertainty-aware mapping pipeline, enabling robust performance across diverse terrains with occlusions.

Abstract: Achieving agile and generalized legged locomotion across terrains requires tight integration of perception and control, especially under occlusions and sparse footholds. Existing methods have demonstrated agility on parkour courses but often rely on end-to-end sensorimotor models with limited generalization and interpretability. By contrast, methods targeting generalized locomotion typically exhibit limited agility and struggle with visual occlusions. We introduce AME-2, a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework for agile and generalized locomotion that incorporates a novel attention-based map encoder in the control policy. This encoder extracts local and global mapping features and uses attention mechanisms to focus on salient regions, producing an interpretable and generalized embedding for RL-based control. We further propose a learning-based mapping pipeline that provides fast, uncertainty-aware terrain representations robust to noise and occlusions, serving as policy inputs. It uses neural networks to convert depth observations into local elevations with uncertainties, and fuses them with odometry. The pipeline also integrates with parallel simulation so that we can train controllers with online mapping, aiding sim-to-real transfer. We validate AME-2 with the proposed mapping pipeline on a quadruped and a biped robot, and the resulting controllers demonstrate strong agility and generalization to unseen terrains in simulation and in real-world experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional IoUT devices have limited battery lifespan and create environmental hazards when disposed. There's a need for sustainable underwater communication systems that can operate indefinitely without battery limitations.

Method: The paper develops two deep-reinforcement learning algorithms: 1) a high-complexity, high-performance frequency division duplex (FDD) solution, and 2) a low-complexity, medium-performance time division duplex (TDD) approach. These optimize age of information (AoI) and Jain's fairness index for data collection.

Result: Both proposed FDD and TDD solutions significantly reduce average AoI, boost harvested energy, and improve data collection fairness compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The sustainable approach using AUVs for simultaneous information uplink and acoustic energy transfer enables potentially indefinite operation of IoUT devices, with DRL-based solutions effectively balancing performance and complexity trade-offs.

Abstract: Internet of underwater things (IoUT) is increasingly gathering attention with the aim of monitoring sea life and deep ocean environment, underwater surveillance as well as maintenance of underwater installments. However, conventional IoUT devices, reliant on battery power, face limitations in lifespan and pose environmental hazards upon disposal. This paper introduces a sustainable approach for simultaneous information uplink from the IoUT devices and acoustic energy transfer (AET) to the devices via an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), potentially enabling them to operate indefinitely. To tackle the time-sensitivity, we adopt age of information (AoI), and Jain's fairness index. We develop two deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, offering a high-complexity, high-performance frequency division duplex (FDD) solution and a low-complexity, medium-performance time division duplex (TDD) approach. The results elucidate that the proposed FDD and TDD solutions significantly reduce the average AoI and boost the harvested energy as well as data collection fairness compared to baseline approaches.

*Davide Risi,Vincenzo Petrone,Antonio Langella,Lorenzo Pagliara,Enrico Ferrentino,Pasquale Chiacchio*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A modular ROS2 architecture with Reference Generator components separates reference handling from control laws, reducing code duplication and improving controller reusability across robot platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate duplicated reference-handling code in controllers and improve reusability across different robot platforms by decoupling reference acquisition/processing from control laws.

Method: Introduces a Reference Generator component that receives references from planners and outputs single-point references at controller sampling rate. Implemented two generators (joint-space and Cartesian) along with new controllers (PD with gravity compensation, Cartesian pose, and admittance controllers).

Result: Reliable reference tracking in all tested scenarios, elimination of duplicated reference-handling code across chained controllers, and controllers remaining focused only on control laws. Validated on simulated and real Universal Robots and Franka Emika manipulators.

Conclusion: The modular architecture successfully separates reference handling from control laws, enabling construction of reusable controller pipelines and cleaner controller implementations focused solely on control algorithms.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel modular architecture for ROS2 that decouples the logic required to acquire, validate, and interpolate references from the control laws that track them. The design includes a dedicated component, named Reference Generator, that receives references, in the form of either single points or trajectories, from external nodes (e.g., planners), and writes single-point references at the controller's sampling period via the existing ros2_control chaining mechanism to downstream controllers. This separation removes duplicated reference-handling code from controllers and improves reusability across robot platforms. We implement two reference generators: one for handling joint-space references and one for Cartesian references, along with a set of new controllers (PD with gravity compensation, Cartesian pose, and admittance controllers) and validate the approach on simulated and real Universal Robots and Franka Emika manipulators. Results show that (i) references are tracked reliably in all tested scenarios, (ii) reference generators reduce duplicated reference-handling code across chained controllers to favor the construction and reuse of complex controller pipelines, and (iii) controller implementations remain focused only on control laws.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more accurate mapping system that better utilizes RGB-D camera properties and uncertainty models, particularly representing objects closer to the camera with higher precision.

Method: Uses keyframe-based approach with local NDT maps updated from RGB-D sensor data. Stores NDT cells in 2D view-dependent structures to match RGB-D camera characteristics. Maintains local maps in a pose graph for global correction after loop closure. Includes merging and filtering procedures to create global maps.

Result: The method naturally achieves higher precision for objects closer to the camera. Successfully creates global maps through local map merging and filtering. Compared favorably with Octomap and NDT-OM mapping systems.

Conclusion: The proposed keyframe-based NDT mapping system effectively utilizes RGB-D camera properties, provides view-dependent precision, and enables robust global mapping through pose graph optimization and local map processing.

Abstract: In this article, we propose a new keyframe-based mapping system. The proposed method updates local Normal Distribution Transform maps (NDT) using data from an RGB-D sensor. The cells of the NDT are stored in 2D view-dependent structures to better utilize the properties and uncertainty model of RGB-D cameras. This method naturally represents an object closer to the camera origin with higher precision. The local maps are stored in the pose graph which allows correcting global map after loop closure detection. We also propose a procedure that allows merging and filtering local maps to obtain a global map of the environment. Finally, we compare our method with Octomap and NDT-OM and provide example applications of the proposed mapping method.

Conclusion: The proposed constraint-aware control framework effectively enables underactuated aerial manipulators to perform accurate end-effector trajectory tracking while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints, with robustness against real-world disturbances and uncertainties.

Abstract: This paper presents a constraint-aware control framework for underactuated aerial manipulators, enabling accurate end-effector trajectory tracking while explicitly accounting for safety and feasibility constraints. The control problem is formulated as a quadratic program that computes dynamically consistent generalized accelerations subject to underactuation, actuator bounds, and system constraints. To enhance robustness against disturbances, modeling uncertainties, and steady-state errors, a passivity-based integral action is incorporated at the torque level without compromising feasibility. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through high-fidelity physics-based simulations, which include parameter perturbations, viscous joint friction, and realistic sensing and state-estimation effects. This demonstrates accurate tracking, smooth control inputs, and reliable constraint satisfaction under realistic operating conditions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLingNav is a VLA model for embodied navigation that introduces adaptive chain-of-thought reasoning and visual-assisted linguistic memory to handle complex, long-horizon navigation tasks, achieving SOTA performance and zero-shot real-world transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models for embodied navigation rely on reactive mappings from observations to actions, lacking explicit reasoning capabilities and persistent memory needed for complex, long-horizon navigation tasks.

Method: 1) Adaptive chain-of-thought mechanism inspired by dual-process theory, dynamically triggering explicit reasoning when needed. 2) Visual-assisted linguistic memory module for persistent cross-modal semantic memory. 3) Trained on Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M dataset with adaptive CoT annotations. 4) Online expert-guided reinforcement learning stage for robust navigation behaviors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across various embodied navigation benchmarks. Transfers to real-world robotic platforms in zero-shot manner, demonstrating strong cross-domain and cross-task generalization.

Conclusion: VLingNav successfully addresses limitations of reactive VLA models by incorporating explicit reasoning and persistent memory, enabling effective handling of complex navigation tasks with strong generalization to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: VLA models have shown promising potential in embodied navigation by unifying perception and planning while inheriting the strong generalization abilities of large VLMs. However, most existing VLA models rely on reactive mappings directly from observations to actions, lacking the explicit reasoning capabilities and persistent memory required for complex, long-horizon navigation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose VLingNav, a VLA model for embodied navigation grounded in linguistic-driven cognition. First, inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition, we introduce an adaptive chain-of-thought mechanism, which dynamically triggers explicit reasoning only when necessary, enabling the agent to fluidly switch between fast, intuitive execution and slow, deliberate planning. Second, to handle long-horizon spatial dependencies, we develop a visual-assisted linguistic memory module that constructs a persistent, cross-modal semantic memory, enabling the agent to recall past observations to prevent repetitive exploration and infer movement trends for dynamic environments. For the training recipe, we construct Nav-AdaCoT-2.9M, the largest embodied navigation dataset with reasoning annotations to date, enriched with adaptive CoT annotations that induce a reasoning paradigm capable of adjusting both when to think and what to think about. Moreover, we incorporate an online expert-guided reinforcement learning stage, enabling the model to surpass pure imitation learning and to acquire more robust, self-explored navigation behaviors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLingNav achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of embodied navigation benchmarks. Notably, VLingNav transfers to real-world robotic platforms in a zero-shot manner, executing various navigation tasks and demonstrating strong cross-domain and cross-task generalization.

Motivation: Robots need to personalize interactions for different populations, especially older adults, by understanding how they respond to varying cadences of verbal and nonverbal feedback during exercise coaching.

Method: Conducted an online study with older adults where participants evaluated videos of a robot giving feedback at different cadences for each modality (verbal and nonverbal).

TL;DR: Hybrid XAI framework combining fuzzy logic and SHAP improves trust in maternal health risk prediction for resource-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical adoption of ML for maternal health in resource-constrained settings is hindered by lack of explainability and trust.

Method: Developed fuzzy-XGBoost model on 1,014 maternal health records, combining ante-hoc fuzzy logic with post-hoc SHAP explanations, validated with 14 healthcare professionals in Bangladesh.

Result: Achieved 88.67% accuracy (ROC-AUC: 0.9703); clinicians strongly preferred hybrid explanations (71.4%) with 54.8% expressing trust for clinical use; SHAP identified healthcare access as primary predictor.

Conclusion: Combining interpretable fuzzy rules with feature importance explanations enhances utility and trust, providing practical insights for XAI deployment in maternal healthcare.

Abstract: While machine learning shows promise for maternal health risk prediction, clinical adoption in resource-constrained settings faces a critical barrier: lack of explainability and trust. This study presents a hybrid explainable AI (XAI) framework combining ante-hoc fuzzy logic with post-hoc SHAP explanations, validated through systematic clinician feedback. We developed a fuzzy-XGBoost model on 1,014 maternal health records, achieving 88.67% accuracy (ROC-AUC: 0.9703). A validation study with 14 healthcare professionals in Bangladesh revealed strong preference for hybrid explanations (71.4% across three clinical cases) with 54.8% expressing trust for clinical use. SHAP analysis identified healthcare access as the primary predictor, with the engineered fuzzy risk score ranking third, validating clinical knowledge integration (r=0.298). Clinicians valued integrated clinical parameters but identified critical gaps: obstetric history, gestational age, and connectivity barriers. This work demonstrates that combining interpretable fuzzy rules with feature importance explanations enhances both utility and trust, providing practical insights for XAI deployment in maternal healthcare.

TL;DR: Executable Ontologies (EO) via boldsea framework enable semantic world modeling in games, where agent behavior emerges from declarative rules rather than explicit coding, demonstrated in a survival game scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the semantic-process gap in game AI architecture by shifting from algorithmic behavior programming to semantic world modeling, where agent behavior naturally emerges from domain rules rather than being explicitly coded.

Method: Implemented Executable Ontologies (EO) using the boldsea framework, demonstrated through a survival game scenario (Winter Feast). EO uses dataflow conditions for priority-based task interruption instead of explicit preemption logic, and compares with Behavior Trees (BT) and Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP).

Result: EO represents a paradigm shift from modeling what agents should do (BT/GOAP) to modeling when actions become possible. This addresses the semantic-process gap, enables priority-based task interruption through dataflow conditions, and offers debugging advantages via temporal event graphs.

Conclusion: Executable Ontologies enable a fundamental shift in game AI architecture by focusing on semantic world modeling rather than algorithmic behavior programming, with potential for LLM-driven runtime model generation and inherent debugging advantages.

Abstract: This paper examines the application of Executable Ontologies (EO), implemented through the boldsea framework, to game development. We argue that EO represents a paradigm shift: a transition from algorithmic behavior programming to semantic world modeling, where agent behavior emerges naturally from declarative domain rules rather than being explicitly coded. Using a survival game scenario (Winter Feast), we demonstrate how EO achieves prioritybased task interruption through dataflow conditions rather than explicit preemption logic. Comparison with Behavior Trees (BT) and Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) reveals that while these approaches model what agents should do, EO models when actions become possible - a fundamental difference that addresses the semantic-process gap in game AI architecture. We discuss integration strategies, debugging advantages inherent to temporal event graphs, and the potential for LLM-driven runtime model generation.

*Chenjie Hao,Weyl Lu,Yuko Ishiwaka,Zengyi Li,Weier Wan,Yubei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A training-free method for model calibration that enables AI models to recognize when they don't know, with applications in model cascading and data cleaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable models to recognize when they don't know, which opens up possibilities for more reliable and trustworthy AI systems. Current approaches need a universal, training-free method that works across both vision and language domains.

Method: A simple, effective, training-free calibration method that works for both vision and language models. The approach uses model calibration, cascading, and data cleaning. Key empirical findings show that higher confidence corresponds to higher accuracy, and calibration transfers from validation to test sets. Two main applications: 1) model cascading with calibrated advantage routing, and 2) data cleaning based on model ensembles using calibrated confidences.

Result: The method enables efficient model cascading (large+small models for efficiency, or two comparable models for better performance) with minimal accuracy loss. Data cleaning effectively identifies mislabeled samples in ImageNet and MMLU datasets by balancing precision and detection rate using multiple experts' calibrated confidences.

Conclusion: Enabling models to recognize when they don't know is a practical step toward more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI. The proposed training-free calibration method provides reliable confidence estimates that enable applications like model cascading and data cleaning across vision and language domains.

Abstract: When a model knows when it does not know, many possibilities emerge. The first question is how to enable a model to recognize that it does not know. A promising approach is to use confidence, computed from the model's internal signals, to reflect its ignorance. Prior work in specific domains has shown that calibration can provide reliable confidence estimates. In this work, we propose a simple, effective, and universal training-free method that applies to both vision and language models, performing model calibration, cascading, and data cleaning to better exploit a model's ability to recognize when it does not know. We first highlight two key empirical observations: higher confidence corresponds to higher accuracy within a single model, and models calibrated on the validation set remain calibrated on a held-out test set. These findings empirically establish the reliability and comparability of calibrated confidence. Building on this, we introduce two applications: (1) model cascading with calibrated advantage routing and (2) data cleaning based on model ensemble. Using the routing signal derived from the comparability of calibrated confidences, we cascade large and small models to improve efficiency with almost no compromise in accuracy, and we further cascade two models of comparable scale to achieve performance beyond either model alone. Leveraging multiple experts and their calibrated confidences, we design a simple yet effective data-cleaning method that balances precision and detection rate to identify mislabeled samples in ImageNet and Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) datasets. Our results demonstrate that enabling models to recognize when they do not know is a practical step toward more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: CADA (Case-Augmented Deliberative Alignment) improves LLM safety by using case-augmented reasoning instead of rigid safety codes, enhancing harmlessness while maintaining helpfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deliberative alignment approaches using detailed "code-like" safety rules work for advanced models but degrade performance in open-source LLMs, causing inconsistent safety improvements and systematic helpfulness degradation.

Method: Proposes CADA: case-augmented deliberative alignment using reinforcement learning on self-generated safety reasoning chains, replacing extensive safety codes with case-augmented simple codes.

Result: CADA effectively enhances harmlessness, improves robustness against attacks, reduces over-refusal, and preserves utility across diverse benchmarks compared to rule-only approaches.

Conclusion: Case-augmented reasoning provides a practical alternative to rule-only deliberative alignment, enabling broader adaptability and more robust safety behaviors without rigid adherence to narrowly enumerated rules.

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) adhere to safety principles without refusing benign requests remains a significant challenge. While OpenAI introduces deliberative alignment (DA) to enhance the safety of its o-series models through reasoning over detailed ``code-like'' safety rules, the effectiveness of this approach in open-source LLMs, which typically lack advanced reasoning capabilities, is understudied. In this work, we systematically evaluate the impact of explicitly specifying extensive safety codes versus demonstrating them through illustrative cases. We find that referencing explicit codes inconsistently improves harmlessness and systematically degrades helpfulness, whereas training on case-augmented simple codes yields more robust and generalized safety behaviors. By guiding LLMs with case-augmented reasoning instead of extensive code-like safety rules, we avoid rigid adherence to narrowly enumerated rules and enable broader adaptability. Building on these insights, we propose CADA, a case-augmented deliberative alignment method for LLMs utilizing reinforcement learning on self-generated safety reasoning chains. CADA effectively enhances harmlessness, improves robustness against attacks, and reduces over-refusal while preserving utility across diverse benchmarks, offering a practical alternative to rule-only DA for improving safety while maintaining helpfulness.

### [125] [Internal Deployment Gaps in AI Regulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08005)
*Joe Kwon,Stephen Casper*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies regulatory gaps in frontier AI oversight for internal corporate deployments and analyzes approaches to address them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI regulations focus on external deployments, but internal corporate use (R&D automation, business processes, sensitive data handling) presents high-stakes risks that may evade oversight.

Method: Examines US and EU frontier AI regulations in 2025, identifies three regulatory gaps, analyzes why gaps persist (measurability, incentives, information access tensions), and maps potential solutions with tradeoffs.

Result: Identifies three key regulatory gaps: (1) scope ambiguity allowing internal systems to evade obligations, (2) point-in-time compliance failing to capture continuous evolution, and (3) information asymmetries undermining oversight.

Conclusion: Understanding these patterns enables deliberate policy choices for internally deployed AI systems rather than incidental oversight gaps, with mapped approaches and tradeoffs for addressing regulatory weaknesses.

Abstract: Frontier AI regulations primarily focus on systems deployed to external users, where deployment is more visible and subject to outside scrutiny. However, high-stakes applications can occur internally when companies deploy highly capable systems within their own organizations, such as for automating R\&D, accelerating critical business processes, and handling sensitive proprietary data. This paper examines how frontier AI regulations in the United States and European Union in 2025 handle internal deployment. We identify three gaps that could cause internally-deployed systems to evade intended oversight: (1) scope ambiguity that allows internal systems to evade regulatory obligations, (2) point-in-time compliance assessments that fail to capture the continuous evolution of internal systems, and (3) information asymmetries that subvert regulatory awareness and oversight. We then analyze why these gaps persist, examining tensions around measurability, incentives, and information access. Finally, we map potential approaches to address them and their associated tradeoffs. By understanding these patterns, we hope that policy choices around internally deployed AI systems can be made deliberately rather than incidentally.

*Keith Ainebyona,Ann Move Oguti,Joseph Walusimbi,Ritah Kobusingye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCASED is an IoT system combining automated attendance tracking with facial emotion recognition to monitor student engagement in smart classrooms, achieving 89.5% accuracy on emotion classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current smart classroom technologies focus mainly on attendance automation, neglecting emotional and cognitive engagement monitoring, which limits instructors' ability to detect disengagement and adapt teaching strategies in real time.

Method: Uses Raspberry Pi camera with OpenCV for face detection and a finetuned MobileNetV2 model to classify four learning-related emotional states (engagement, boredom, confusion, frustration). Implements session-based attendance recording and continuous emotion analysis, with cloud-based dashboard for data visualization.

Result: Achieved 89.5% emotion classification accuracy using the DAiSEE dataset. The system successfully integrates attendance data with emotion analytics to provide insights into classroom dynamics.

Conclusion: Integrating attendance tracking with emotion recognition provides instructors with valuable insights into classroom engagement, supporting more responsive teaching practices and addressing the limitations of current smart classroom technologies.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of smart classroom technologies in higher education has mainly focused on automating attendance, with limited attention given to students' emotional and cognitive engagement during lectures. This limits instructors' ability to identify disengagement and adapt teaching strategies in real time. This paper presents SCASED (Smart Classroom Attendance System with Emotion Detection), an IoT-based system that integrates automated attendance tracking with facial emotion recognition to support classroom engagement monitoring. The system uses a Raspberry Pi camera and OpenCV for face detection, and a finetuned MobileNetV2 model to classify four learning-related emotional states: engagement, boredom, confusion, and frustration. A session-based mechanism is implemented to manage attendance and emotion monitoring by recording attendance once per session and performing continuous emotion analysis thereafter. Attendance and emotion data are visualized through a cloud-based dashboard to provide instructors with insights into classroom dynamics. Experimental evaluation using the DAiSEE dataset achieved an emotion classification accuracy of 89.5%. The results show that integrating attendance data with emotion analytics can provide instructors with additional insight into classroom dynamics and support more responsive teaching practices.

*Nawazish Alia,Rachael Shawb,Karl Mason*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a Deep RL framework for dairy farm energy management using Forecast Aware PPO and PID KL PPO variants to optimize battery storage and water heating scheduling, achieving cost savings and reduced grid dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dairy farming is energy intensive and heavily reliant on grid electricity. With renewable energy integration, sustainable energy management is needed to reduce grid dependence and support UN SDG 7. However, renewables' intermittency creates supply-demand balancing challenges, and existing RL methods often assume unrealistic complete future knowledge while standard PPO variants suffer from unstable training under variable tariffs.

Method: Proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for dairy farm load scheduling focusing on battery storage and water heating. Two PPO variants: 1) Forecast Aware PPO incorporates short-term demand/renewable forecasts using hour-of-day and month-based residual calibration; 2) PID KL PPO uses a proportional-integral-derivative controller to adaptively regulate KL divergence for stable policy updates. Both handle realistic operational constraints.

Result: Trained on real-world dairy farm data, the method achieves: 1% lower electricity cost than standard PPO, 4.8% lower than DQN, and 1.5% lower than SAC. For battery scheduling, PPO reduces grid imports by 13.1%, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness for sustainable energy management.

Conclusion: The proposed Deep RL framework effectively addresses dairy farm energy management challenges by incorporating realistic forecasts and adaptive KL divergence control, achieving significant cost savings and grid import reduction while supporting sustainable energy goals in modern dairy farming.

Abstract: Dairy farming is an energy intensive sector that relies heavily on grid electricity. With increasing renewable energy integration, sustainable energy management has become essential for reducing grid dependence and supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 on affordable and clean energy. However, the intermittent nature of renewables poses challenges in balancing supply and demand in real time. Intelligent load scheduling is therefore crucial to minimize operational costs while maintaining reliability. Reinforcement Learning has shown promise in improving energy efficiency and reducing costs. However, most RL-based scheduling methods assume complete knowledge of future prices or generation, which is unrealistic in dynamic environments. Moreover, standard PPO variants rely on fixed clipping or KL divergence thresholds, often leading to unstable training under variable tariffs. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for efficient load scheduling in dairy farms, focusing on battery storage and water heating under realistic operational constraints. The proposed Forecast Aware PPO incorporates short term forecasts of demand and renewable generation using hour of day and month based residual calibration, while the PID KL PPO variant employs a proportional integral derivative controller to regulate KL divergence for stable policy updates adaptively. Trained on real world dairy farm data, the method achieves up to 1% lower electricity cost than PPO, 4.8% than DQN, and 1.5% than SAC. For battery scheduling, PPO reduces grid imports by 13.1%, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness for sustainable energy management in modern dairy farming.

TL;DR: New backward reachability algorithms for neural feedback systems that compute both over- and under-approximations, integrated with forward analysis for unified verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forward reachability analysis dominates neural feedback system verification due to limited scalability of existing backward methods, creating a need for more scalable backward approaches.

Method: Introduces new algorithms that compute both over- and under-approximations of backward reachable sets, then integrates these backward algorithms with established forward analysis techniques.

Result: Creates a unified verification framework for neural feedback systems by combining backward and forward reachability analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed integration of backward and forward reachability methods addresses scalability limitations and provides a more comprehensive verification approach for neural feedback systems.

Abstract: Forward reachability analysis is the predominant approach for verifying reach-avoid properties in neural feedback systems (dynamical systems controlled by neural networks). This dominance stems from the limited scalability of existing backward reachability methods. In this work, we introduce new algorithms that compute both over- and under-approximations of backward reachable sets for such systems. We further integrate these backward algorithms with established forward analysis techniques to yield a unified verification framework for neural feedback systems.

### [129] [Semantic Gravity Wells: Why Negative Constraints Backfire](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08070)
*Shailesh Rana*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Negative constraints (e.g., "do not use word X") fail systematically in LLMs due to semantic pressure and two failure modes: priming (87.5%) where mentioning the forbidden word activates it, and override (12.5%) where late-layer networks overwhelm suppression signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why negative constraints fail so regularly in LLMs despite their apparent simplicity, and to investigate the mechanistic causes behind these failures through quantitative analysis.

Method: Introduced semantic pressure as a quantitative measure of intrinsic probability of generating forbidden tokens; used logistic regression analysis (40,000 samples); conducted layer-wise analysis using logit lens technique; identified two failure modes through activation patching in layers 23-27.

Result: Found tight logistic relationship between violation probability and semantic pressure; discovered 4.4× asymmetry in suppression signal strength between successes and failures; identified two distinct failure modes: priming failure (87.5%) where instruction activates target, and override failure (12.5%) where late-layer networks generate +0.39 probability contributions overwhelming suppression.

Conclusion: Negative constraint design has a fundamental tension: naming a forbidden word paradoxically primes the model to produce it, revealing systematic weaknesses in LLMs' instruction-following capabilities for negative constraints.

Abstract: Negative constraints (instructions of the form "do not use word X") represent a fundamental test of instruction-following capability in large language models. Despite their apparent simplicity, these constraints fail with striking regularity, and the conditions governing failure have remained poorly understood. This paper presents the first comprehensive mechanistic investigation of negative instruction failure. We introduce semantic pressure, a quantitative measure of the model's intrinsic probability of generating the forbidden token, and demonstrate that violation probability follows a tight logistic relationship with pressure ($p=σ(-2.40+2.27\cdot P_0)$; $n=40{,}000$ samples; bootstrap $95%$ CI for slope: $[2.21,,2.33]$). Through layer-wise analysis using the logit lens technique, we establish that the suppression signal induced by negative instructions is present but systematically weaker in failures: the instruction reduces target probability by only 5.2 percentage points in failures versus 22.8 points in successes -- a $4.4\times$ asymmetry. We trace this asymmetry to two mechanistically distinct failure modes. In priming failure (87.5% of violations), the instruction's explicit mention of the forbidden word paradoxically activates rather than suppresses the target representation. In override failure (12.5%), late-layer feed-forward networks generate contributions of $+0.39$ toward the target probability -- nearly $4\times$ larger than in successes -- overwhelming earlier suppression signals. Activation patching confirms that layers 23--27 are causally responsible: replacing these layers' activations flips the sign of constraint effects. These findings reveal a fundamental tension in negative constraint design: the very act of naming a forbidden word primes the model to produce it.

### [130] [MemoBrain: Executive Memory as an Agentic Brain for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08079)
*Hongjin Qian,Zhao Cao,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MemoBrain is an executive memory model for tool-augmented agents that manages reasoning traces and tool artifacts to maintain coherent long-horizon reasoning under fixed context constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex reasoning in tool-augmented agents generates long reasoning traces and tool artifacts that accumulate and strain the bounded context of LLMs, disrupting logical continuity and task alignment. Memory is essential for sustaining coherent, goal-directed reasoning over long horizons.

Method: MemoBrain constructs a dependency-aware memory over reasoning steps, capturing intermediate states and logical relations. It operates as a co-pilot that organizes reasoning progress without blocking execution, actively managing working context by pruning invalid steps, folding completed sub-trajectories, and preserving a compact, high-salience reasoning backbone under fixed context budget.

Result: MemoBrain demonstrates consistent improvements over strong baselines on challenging long-horizon benchmarks including GAIA, WebWalker, and BrowseComp-Plus.

Conclusion: Memory is not just an efficiency concern but a core component for sustaining coherent reasoning in tool-augmented agents. MemoBrain's executive memory model enables explicit cognitive control over reasoning trajectories rather than passive context accumulation, improving performance on long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Complex reasoning in tool-augmented agent frameworks is inherently long-horizon, causing reasoning traces and transient tool artifacts to accumulate and strain the bounded working context of large language models. Without explicit memory mechanisms, such accumulation disrupts logical continuity and undermines task alignment. This positions memory not as an auxiliary efficiency concern, but as a core component for sustaining coherent, goal-directed reasoning over long horizons.
  We propose MemoBrain, an executive memory model for tool-augmented agents that constructs a dependency-aware memory over reasoning steps, capturing salient intermediate states and their logical relations. Operating as a co-pilot alongside the reasoning agent, MemoBrain organizes reasoning progress without blocking execution and actively manages the working context. Specifically, it prunes invalid steps, folds completed sub-trajectories, and preserves a compact, high-salience reasoning backbone under a fixed context budget. Together, these mechanisms enable explicit cognitive control over reasoning trajectories rather than passive context accumulation.
  We evaluate MemoBrain on challenging long-horizon benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalker, and BrowseComp-Plus, demonstrating consistent improvements over strong baselines.

*Ashutosh Hathidara,Julien Yu,Vaishali Senthil,Sebastian Schreiber,Anil Babu Ankisettipalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIRRORBENCH is a benchmarking framework for evaluating LLM-based user proxy agents on their ability to generate human-like utterances, decoupled from downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used as human simulators for evaluating conversational systems and generating fine-tuning data, but naive prompting often produces verbose, unrealistic utterances, highlighting the need for principled evaluation of user proxy agents.

Method: A modular benchmarking framework with typed interfaces, metadata-driven registries, multi-backend support, caching, and observability. It supports pluggable user proxies, datasets, tasks, and metrics, including three lexical-diversity metrics (MATTR, YULE'S K, HD-D) and three LLM-judge-based metrics (GTEval, Pairwise Indistinguishability, Rubric-and-Reason).

Result: The framework yields variance-aware results across four open datasets and reveals systematic gaps between user proxies and real human users. It's open source with a command-line interface for experiments, configuration management, caching, and report generation.

Conclusion: MIRRORBENCH provides a reproducible, extensible framework for evaluating user proxy agents on human-likeness, addressing the limitations of naive prompting approaches and enabling systematic comparison under uniform evaluation conditions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as human simulators, both for evaluating conversational systems and for generating fine-tuning data. However, naive "act-as-a-user" prompting often yields verbose, unrealistic utterances, underscoring the need for principled evaluation of so-called user proxy agents. We present MIRRORBENCH, a reproducible, extensible benchmarking framework that evaluates user proxies solely on their ability to produce human-like user utterances across diverse conversational tasks, explicitly decoupled from downstream task success. MIRRORBENCH features a modular execution engine with typed interfaces, metadata-driven registries, multi-backend support, caching, and robust observability. The system supports pluggable user proxies, datasets, tasks, and metrics, enabling researchers to evaluate arbitrary simulators under a uniform, variance-aware harness. We include three lexical-diversity metrics (MATTR, YULE'S K, and HD-D) and three LLM-judge-based metrics (GTEval, Pairwise Indistinguishability, and Rubric-and-Reason). Across four open datasets, MIRRORBENCH yields variance-aware results and reveals systematic gaps between user proxies and real human users. The framework is open source and includes a simple command-line interface for running experiments, managing configurations and caching, and generating reports. The framework can be accessed at https://github.com/SAP/mirrorbench.

*Kequan Chen,Yuxuan Wang,Pan Liu,Victor L. Knoop,David Z. W. Wang,Yu Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies post-crash lane changes, analyzes their unique characteristics compared to normal lane changes, and develops a novel trajectory prediction framework that models yielding behavior to improve prediction accuracy and crash risk analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-crash lane changes are complex maneuvers where vehicles need to bypass crash obstructions, but vehicles in target lanes often refuse to yield even after lane changes have begun, increasing crash risks. The behavioral characteristics and motion patterns of these maneuvers remain unknown, creating a research gap.

Method: 1) Constructed a post-crash lane change dataset from drone videos of actual crashes; 2) Conducted empirical analysis comparing post-crash LCs with mandatory and discretionary LCs; 3) Developed a novel trajectory prediction framework with a graph-based attention module that explicitly models yielding behavior as an auxiliary interaction-aware task; 4) Used conditional variational autoencoder and Transformer-based decoder for trajectory prediction.

Result: Post-crash LCs have longer durations, lower insertion speeds, and higher crash risks than normal LCs. 79.4% involve non-yielding behavior vs. 21.7% for DLCs and 28.6% for MLCs. The proposed model outperforms baselines by >10% in both ADE and FDE across prediction horizons, reduces false crash rates, and improves conflict prediction accuracy. Transferability validated on additional datasets.

Conclusion: Post-crash lane changes exhibit distinct characteristics with high non-yielding behavior rates. The proposed interaction-aware trajectory prediction framework effectively captures yielding behavior dynamics, significantly improving prediction accuracy and crash risk analysis for these critical safety scenarios.

Abstract: When a traffic crash occurs, following vehicles need to change lanes to bypass the obstruction. We define these maneuvers as post crash lane changes. In such scenarios, vehicles in the target lane may refuse to yield even after the lane change has already begun, increasing the complexity and crash risk of post crash LCs. However, the behavioral characteristics and motion patterns of post crash LCs remain unknown. To address this gap, we construct a post crash LC dataset by extracting vehicle trajectories from drone videos captured after crashes. Our empirical analysis reveals that, compared to mandatory LCs (MLCs) and discretionary LCs (DLCs), post crash LCs exhibit longer durations, lower insertion speeds, and higher crash risks. Notably, 79.4% of post crash LCs involve at least one instance of non yielding behavior from the new follower, compared to 21.7% for DLCs and 28.6% for MLCs. Building on these findings, we develop a novel trajectory prediction framework for post crash LCs. At its core is a graph based attention module that explicitly models yielding behavior as an auxiliary interaction aware task. This module is designed to guide both a conditional variational autoencoder and a Transformer based decoder to predict the lane changer's trajectory. By incorporating the interaction aware module, our model outperforms existing baselines in trajectory prediction performance by more than 10% in both average displacement error and final displacement error across different prediction horizons. Moreover, our model provides more reliable crash risk analysis by reducing false crash rates and improving conflict prediction accuracy. Finally, we validate the model's transferability using additional post crash LC datasets collected from different sites.

TL;DR: Proposes a memory system for edge AI companions that alternates between active (low-latency retrieval) and inactive (computationally intensive consolidation) phases to balance performance with resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices have computational constraints that prevent running full AI companion systems with satisfactory user experience. Existing memory systems can't be directly used due to compute limitations and latency concerns.

Method: Memory paradigm with alternating phases: active phase uses lightweight retrieval for real-time dialog; inactive phase performs intensive extraction, consolidation, and maintenance of memories across full conversations.

Result: System using Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct quantized int4 outperforms equivalent raw LLM without memory across most metrics, and performs comparably to GPT-3.5 with 16k context window.

Conclusion: The proposed design minimizes latency while maintaining long-term personalization under embedded hardware constraints, with a new benchmark for holistic evaluation of AI companions.

Abstract: Computational resource constraints on edge devices make it difficult to develop a fully embedded AI companion system with a satisfactory user experience. AI companion and memory systems detailed in existing literature cannot be directly used in such an environment due to lack of compute resources and latency concerns. In this paper, we propose a memory paradigm that alternates between active and inactive phases: during phases of user activity, the system performs low-latency, real-time dialog using lightweight retrieval over existing memories and context; whereas during phases of user inactivity, it conducts more computationally intensive extraction, consolidation, and maintenance of memories across full conversation sessions. This design minimizes latency while maintaining long-term personalization under the tight constraints of embedded hardware. We also introduce an AI Companion benchmark designed to holistically evaluate the AI Companion across both its conversational quality and memory capabilities. In our experiments, we found that our system (using a very weak model: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct quantized int4) outperforms the equivalent raw LLM without memory across most metrics, and performs comparably to GPT-3.5 with 16k context window.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hierarchical MARL framework for thermal/energy-aware scheduling on multi-cores using LLM feature extraction and model-based planning, achieving 7.09x better energy efficiency and 4.0x better makespan than Linux ondemand.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DVFS and task allocation approaches either use simplistic heuristics ignoring stall times or require extensive offline profiling, preventing runtime adaptation in dynamic embedded systems.

Method: Model-based hierarchical MARL with two collaborative agents decomposing action space, Dyna-Q-inspired framework integrating direct RL with model-based planning, LLM-based semantic feature extraction for OpenMP programs, and accurate environment model for thermal/performance prediction.

Result: Achieves 7.09x better energy efficiency and 4.0x better makespan than Linux ondemand governor, 20x faster convergence than model-free methods, 358ms latency for subsequent decisions, and 8,300x faster first-decision latency than table-based profiling.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables practical deployment in dynamic embedded systems through zero-shot deployment for new workloads using LLM-extracted features and synthetic training data, without requiring workload-specific profiling.

Abstract: Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and task-to-core allocation are critical for thermal management and balancing energy and performance in embedded systems. Existing approaches either rely on utilization-based heuristics that overlook stall times, or require extensive offline profiling for table generation, preventing runtime adaptation. We propose a model-based hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for thermal- and energy-aware scheduling on multi-core platforms. Two collaborative agents decompose the exponential action space, achieving 358ms latency for subsequent decisions. First decisions require 3.5 to 8.0s including one-time LLM feature extraction. An accurate environment model leverages regression techniques to predict thermal dynamics and performance states. When combined with LLM-extracted semantic features, the environment model enables zero-shot deployment for new workloads on trained platforms by generating synthetic training data without requiring workload-specific profiling samples. We introduce LLM-based semantic feature extraction that characterizes OpenMP programs through 13 code-level features without execution. The Dyna-Q-inspired framework integrates direct reinforcement learning with model-based planning, achieving 20x faster convergence than model-free methods. Experiments on BOTS and PolybenchC benchmarks across NVIDIA Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RubikPi, and Intel Core i7 demonstrate 7.09x better energy efficiency and 4.0x better makespan than Linux ondemand governor. First-decision latency is 8,300x faster than table-based profiling, enabling practical deployment in dynamic embedded systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM research focuses on performance upper bounds in static environments but overlooks robustness needed for stochastic real-world deployment. There's a gap in evaluating agents for dynamic task scheduling, active exploration under uncertainty, and continuous learning from experience.

Method: Introduces EvoEnv, a dynamic evaluation environment that simulates a "trainee" agent exploring novel settings. It evaluates agents along three dimensions: 1) context-aware scheduling for streaming tasks with varying priorities, 2) prudent information acquisition via active exploration to reduce hallucination, and 3) continuous evolution by distilling generalized strategies from rule-based, dynamically generated tasks.

Result: Experiments show cutting-edge agents have significant deficiencies in dynamic environments, especially in active exploration and continual learning capabilities.

Conclusion: EvoEnv establishes a framework for assessing agent reliability, shifting evaluation from static tests to realistic, production-oriented scenarios that better reflect real-world deployment challenges.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has advanced workflow automation; however, existing research mainly targets performance upper bounds in static environments, overlooking robustness for stochastic real-world deployment. We identify three key challenges: dynamic task scheduling, active exploration under uncertainty, and continuous learning from experience. To bridge this gap, we introduce \method{}, a dynamic evaluation environment that simulates a "trainee" agent continuously exploring a novel setting. Unlike traditional benchmarks, \method{} evaluates agents along three dimensions: (1) context-aware scheduling for streaming tasks with varying priorities; (2) prudent information acquisition to reduce hallucination via active exploration; and (3) continuous evolution by distilling generalized strategies from rule-based, dynamically generated tasks. Experiments show that cutting-edge agents have significant deficiencies in dynamic environments, especially in active exploration and continual learning.

*Zijun Di,Bin Lu,Huquan Kang,Luoyi Fu,Jiaxin Ding,Xiaoying Gan,Lei Zhou,Xinbing Wang,Chenghu Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HS2C is a framework that compresses Text-Attributed Graphs for LLMs by exploiting graph homophily through structural partitioning and semantic aggregation, improving both compression rate and inference accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for feeding graphs to LLMs use random sampling due to context window constraints, which introduces noise and instability. The authors argue that graphs contain rich structural/semantic information that can be better exploited to improve LLM reasoning performance.

Method: HS2C uses graph homophily in two ways: 1) Structurally: performs global hierarchical partition guided by Structural Entropy minimization to identify cohesive, homophilic communities while removing noise; 2) Semantically: enables LLMs to perform differentiated semantic aggregation based on community types, compressing redundant contexts into community-level consensus while preserving homophilic information.

Result: Extensive experiments on 10 node-level benchmarks across various LLM sizes/families show HS2C simultaneously enhances compression rate and downstream inference accuracy. Extensions to 7 graph-level benchmarks further demonstrate task generalizability and scalability.

Conclusion: By exploiting graph homophily through structural and semantic compression, HS2C provides a superior and scalable approach for LLM-based graph understanding that overcomes context window limitations while improving reasoning performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in Text-Attributed Graph (TAG) understanding. Recent studies typically focus on verbalizing the graph structures via handcrafted prompts, feeding the target node and its neighborhood context into LLMs. However, constrained by the context window, existing methods mainly resort to random sampling, often implemented via dropping node/edge randomly, which inevitably introduces noise and cause reasoning instability. We argue that graphs inherently contain rich structural and semantic information, and that their effective exploitation can unlock potential gains in LLMs reasoning performance. To this end, we propose Homophily-aware Structural and Semantic Compression for LLMs (HS2C), a framework centered on exploiting graph homophily. Structurally, guided by the principle of Structural Entropy minimization, we perform a global hierarchical partition that decodes the graph's essential topology. This partition identifies naturally cohesive, homophilic communities, while discarding stochastic connectivity noise. Semantically, we deliver the detected structural homophily to the LLM, empowering it to perform differentiated semantic aggregation based on predefined community type. This process compresses redundant background contexts into concise community-level consensus, selectively preserving semantically homophilic information aligned with the target nodes. Extensive experiments on 10 node-level benchmarks across LLMs of varying sizes and families demonstrate that, by feeding LLMs with structurally and semantically compressed inputs, HS2C simultaneously enhances the compression rate and downstream inference accuracy, validating its superiority and scalability. Extensions to 7 diverse graph-level benchmarks further consolidate HS2C's task generalizability.

*Chucai Wang,Lingfeng Li,Yunlong Lu,Wenxin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes Official International Mahjong for online play, identifies fairness issues in single-round games, uses AI self-play to reveal first-mover advantage and scoring problems, and proposes rule adaptations with compensatory points and refined subgoal scoring for better online balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online Mahjong differs from offline play - players have fragmented time and random opponents rather than fixed groups playing multiple rounds. Traditional rules designed for offline multi-round play with position rotation don't work well for online single-round games, creating fairness issues that need to be addressed.

Method: Used a world champion AI to engage in self-play competitions and conducted statistical data analysis to identify balance issues. Analyzed first-mover advantage and subgoal scoring problems through AI gameplay data.

Result: Revealed significant first-mover advantage and issues with subgoal scoring settings. Found that traditional position rotation over multiple rounds (used offline) doesn't work for online single-round play.

Conclusion: Proposed rule adaptations including compensatory points for first-mover advantage and refined subgoal scoring for different tile patterns. Implemented revised Mahjong game online. This represents an initial attempt to use AI data to evaluate and adapt traditional games for online environments.

Abstract: As one of the worldwide spread traditional game, Official International Mahjong can be played and promoted online through remote devices instead of requiring face-to-face interaction. However, online players have fragmented playtime and unfixed combination of opponents in contrary to offline players who have fixed opponents for multiple rounds of play. Therefore, the rules designed for offline players need to be modified to ensure the fairness of online single-round play. Specifically, We employ a world champion AI to engage in self-play competitions and conduct statistical data analysis. Our study reveals the first-mover advantage and issues in the subgoal scoring settings. Based on our findings, we propose rule adaptations to make the game more suitable for the online environment, such as introducing compensatory points for the first-mover advantage and refining the scores of subgoals for different tile patterns. Compared with the traditional method of rotating positions over multiple rounds to balance first-mover advantage, our compensatory points mechanism in each round is more convenient for online players. Furthermore, we implement the revised Mahjong game online, which is open for online players.

### [139] [An Axiomatic Approach to General Intelligence: SANC(E3) -- Self-organizing Active Network of Concepts with Energy E3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08224)
*Daesuk Kwon,Won-gi Paeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SANC(E3) is an axiomatic framework where representational units emerge through competitive selection and compression under finite capacity, unifying perception, imagination, and planning via Gestalt completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI systems assume fixed primitive units (tokens, pixels) without explaining how representational units themselves emerge and stabilize. The paper aims to develop a principled framework where units arise from self-organization rather than being predefined.

Method: Proposes SANC(E3) framework with five core axioms: finite capacity, association from co-occurrence, similarity-based competition, confidence-based stabilization, and reconstruction-compression-update trade-off. Uses pseudo-memory-mapped I/O mechanism where internally replayed Gestalts are processed like external input.

Result: Derives twelve propositions showing that category formation, hierarchical organization, unsupervised learning, and high-level cognitive activities can all be understood as instances of Gestalt completion under E3 minimization. Unifies perception, imagination, prediction, planning, and action within single representational process.

Conclusion: SANC(E3) provides principled framework where representational units emerge through competitive selection and compression, offering unified account of cognitive processes via Gestalt completion under energy minimization.

Abstract: General intelligence must reorganize experience into internal structures that enable prediction and action under finite resources. Existing systems implicitly presuppose fixed primitive units -- tokens, subwords, pixels, or predefined sensor channels -- thereby bypassing the question of how representational units themselves emerge and stabilize. This paper proposes SANC(E3), an axiomatic framework in which representational units are not given a priori but instead arise as stable outcomes of competitive selection, reconstruction, and compression under finite activation capacity, governed by the explicit minimization of an energy functional E3. SANC(E3) draws a principled distinction between system tokens -- structural anchors such as {here, now, I} and sensory sources -- and tokens that emerge through self-organization during co-occurring events. Five core axioms formalize finite capacity, association from co-occurrence, similarity-based competition, confidence-based stabilization, and the reconstruction-compression-update trade-off. A key feature is a pseudo-memory-mapped I/O mechanism, through which internally replayed Gestalts are processed via the same axiomatic pathway as external sensory input. As a result, perception, imagination, prediction, planning, and action are unified within a single representational and energetic process. From the axioms, twelve propositions are derived, showing that category formation, hierarchical organization, unsupervised learning, and high-level cognitive activities can all be understood as instances of Gestalt completion under E3 minimization.

*Shouju Wang,Haopeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MPCI-Bench is the first multimodal benchmark for evaluating privacy behavior in AI agents using Contextual Integrity principles, addressing gaps in existing text-centric benchmarks by including visual privacy risks and privacy-utility tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Contextual Integrity benchmarks are text-focused and emphasize negative refusal scenarios, missing multimodal privacy risks and the fundamental privacy-utility tradeoff that's crucial for proactive AI assistants handling personal data.

Method: Created MPCI-Bench with paired positive/negative instances from same visual sources across three tiers: normative Seed judgments, context-rich Story reasoning, and executable agent action Traces. Used Tri-Principle Iterative Refinement pipeline for data quality.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art multimodal models revealed systematic failures in balancing privacy and utility, and a pronounced modality leakage gap where sensitive visual information leaks more frequently than textual information.

Conclusion: MPCI-Bench addresses critical gaps in evaluating agentic privacy behavior, reveals important model limitations, and will be open-sourced to facilitate future research on Contextual Integrity in AI agents.

Abstract: As language-model agents evolve from passive chatbots into proactive assistants that handle personal data, evaluating their adherence to social norms becomes increasingly critical, often through the lens of Contextual Integrity (CI). However, existing CI benchmarks are largely text-centric and primarily emphasize negative refusal scenarios, overlooking multimodal privacy risks and the fundamental trade-off between privacy and utility. In this paper, we introduce MPCI-Bench, the first Multimodal Pairwise Contextual Integrity benchmark for evaluating privacy behavior in agentic settings. MPCI-Bench consists of paired positive and negative instances derived from the same visual source and instantiated across three tiers: normative Seed judgments, context-rich Story reasoning, and executable agent action Traces. Data quality is ensured through a Tri-Principle Iterative Refinement pipeline. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal models reveal systematic failures to balance privacy and utility and a pronounced modality leakage gap, where sensitive visual information is leaked more frequently than textual information. We will open-source MPCI-Bench to facilitate future research on agentic CI.

*Haoran Su,Yandong Sun,Congjia Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes shifting from manual reward engineering to language-based objective specification in multi-agent RL, leveraging LLMs for semantic reward synthesis and adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward engineering is challenging in multi-agent RL due to credit assignment ambiguity, environmental non-stationarity, and combinatorial interaction complexity. Traditional manual specification of numerical reward functions is difficult and doesn't scale well.

Method: Proposes using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize reward functions from natural language descriptions (like EUREKA) and adapt reward formulations online (like CARD). Builds on the Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm that uses language-mediated supervision as an alternative to traditional reward engineering.

Result: Conceptualizes the transition along three dimensions: semantic reward specification, dynamic reward adaptation, and improved alignment with human intent. Identifies open challenges including computational overhead, robustness to hallucination, and scalability to large multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: Outlines a research direction where coordination emerges from shared semantic representations rather than explicitly engineered numerical signals, suggesting a paradigm shift in multi-agent RL reward design.

Abstract: Reward engineering, the manual specification of reward functions to induce desired agent behavior, remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. This difficulty is amplified by credit assignment ambiguity, environmental non-stationarity, and the combinatorial growth of interaction complexity. We argue that recent advances in large language models (LLMs) point toward a shift from hand-crafted numerical rewards to language-based objective specifications. Prior work has shown that LLMs can synthesize reward functions directly from natural language descriptions (e.g., EUREKA) and adapt reward formulations online with minimal human intervention (e.g., CARD). In parallel, the emerging paradigm of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) provides empirical evidence that language-mediated supervision can serve as a viable alternative to traditional reward engineering. We conceptualize this transition along three dimensions: semantic reward specification, dynamic reward adaptation, and improved alignment with human intent, while noting open challenges related to computational overhead, robustness to hallucination, and scalability to large multi-agent systems. We conclude by outlining a research direction in which coordination arises from shared semantic representations rather than explicitly engineered numerical signals.

Motivation: Large AI Models offer better performance with great generalization and reduced task-specific training for Non-Terrestrial Networks applications.

Method: Propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent guided by a Large Language Model, where the LLM acts as a high-level coordinator generating textual guidance to shape the DRL agent's reward during training.

Result: LAM-DRL outperforms traditional DRL by 40% in nominal weather scenarios and 64% in extreme weather scenarios compared to heuristics in terms of throughput, fairness, and outage probability.

Conclusion: LLM-guided DRL approach effectively enhances NTN performance, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional methods in various weather conditions.

Abstract: Large AI Model (LAM) have been proposed to applications of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), that offer better performance with its great generalization and reduced task specific trainings. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent that is guided by a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM operates as a high level coordinator that generates textual guidance that shape the reward of the DRL agent during training. The results show that the LAM-DRL outperforms the traditional DRL by 40% in nominal weather scenarios and 64% in extreme weather scenarios compared to heuristics in terms of throughput, fairness, and outage probability.

*Edward Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T3 is a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating LLM causal judgment across Pearl's Ladder of Causality, revealing pathologies like Skepticism Trap and Scaling Paradox in frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need to rigorously evaluate LLM causal reasoning capabilities across different levels of causal inference (Pearl's Ladder), with focus on identifying specific failure modes and pathologies in current models.

Method: Created T3 benchmark with 454 expert-curated vignettes, evaluating models across Pearl's Ladder of Causality with metrics for Utility (sensitivity), Safety (specificity), and Wise Refusal. Applied to frontier models and validated a process-verified protocol (RCA).

Result: Identified two pathologies: 1) Skepticism Trap at L1 where safety-tuned models reject valid links (Claude Haiku rejects 60%), and 2) Scaling Paradox at L3 where larger GPT-5.2 underperforms GPT-4-Turbo by 55 points due to excessive hedging. RCA protocol successfully restored decisive causal judgment.

Conclusion: T3 effectively diagnoses specific causal reasoning pathologies in LLMs, revealing non-intuitive scaling behaviors and safety-tuning side effects, while providing a framework for evaluating and improving causal judgment through structured verification protocols.

Abstract: We introduce T3 (Testing Trustworthy Thinking), a diagnostic benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLM causal judgment across Pearl's Ladder of Causality. Comprising 454 expert-curated vignettes, T3 prioritizes high-resolution failure analysis, decomposing performance into Utility (sensitivity), Safety (specificity), and Wise Refusal on underdetermined cases. By applying T3 to frontier models, we diagnose two distinct pathologies: a "Skepticism Trap" at L1 (where safety-tuned models like Claude Haiku reject 60% of valid links) and a non-monotonic Scaling Paradox at L3. In the latter, the larger GPT-5.2 underperforms GPT-4-Turbo by 55 points on ambiguous counterfactuals, driven by a collapse into paralysis (excessive hedging) rather than hallucination. Finally, we use the benchmark to validate a process-verified protocol (RCA), showing that T3 successfully captures the restoration of decisive causal judgment under structured verification.

*Subham Sharma,Sharmila Subudhi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hand gesture recognition system using VGG-16 CNN with transfer learning and data augmentation achieves ~98% accuracy for sign language applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective hand gesture recognition system for differently-abled persons, particularly for sign language communication, as part of human-computer interaction.

Method: Uses VGG-16 convolutional neural network with transfer learning and image data augmentation. Trained on a standard image dataset using Python and Keras, validated on NUS dataset (10 gesture classes), and tested on custom dataset created using Google's API.

Result: The system achieved approximately 98% accuracy by combining transfer learning with image data augmentation techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed VGG-16 based system with transfer learning and data augmentation is highly effective for hand gesture recognition, making it suitable for assistive applications for differently-abled individuals.

Abstract: Hand gesture recognition is an important aspect of human-computer interaction. It forms the basis of sign language for the visually impaired people. This work proposes a novel hand gesture recognizing system for the differently-abled persons. The model uses a convolutional neural network, known as VGG-16 net, for building a trained model on a widely used image dataset by employing Python and Keras libraries. Furthermore, the result is validated by the NUS dataset, consisting of 10 classes of hand gestures, fed to the model as the validation set. Afterwards, a testing dataset of 10 classes is built by employing Google's open source Application Programming Interface (API) that captures different gestures of human hand and the efficacy is then measured by carrying out experiments. The experimental results show that by combining a transfer learning mechanism together with the image data augmentation, the VGG-16 net produced around 98% accuracy.

*Angshul Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper formalizes Sparse Agentic Control (SAC) for tool-augmented LLMs, showing that policies with sparse tool usage can be learned efficiently with logarithmic dependence on the total number of tools, while dense policies require linear samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tool-augmented LLM systems operate in a massive discrete action space (tools/APIs) where only a small subset is relevant for any task, creating a control problem that traditional learning theory hasn't addressed.

Method: Formalizes SAC with block-sparse policy representations, uses ell_{1,2}-regularized policy learning through convex surrogates, and analyzes via compressed-sensing-style theory with Policy-RSC conditions and primal-dual witness arguments.

Result: Estimation scales as k(log M/T)^{1/2} with exact tool-support recovery when T > k log M; dense policies require Ω(M) samples; under partial observability, LLM quality only adds O(ε_b) degradation while preserving log M dependence.

Conclusion: Sparse agentic control enables efficient tool usage in LLMs with logarithmic scaling in tool count, explaining why prompt-only controllers are unstable and providing theoretical foundation for tool-augmented LLM systems.

Abstract: Tool-augmented LLM systems expose a control regime that learning theory has largely ignored: sequential decision-making with a massive discrete action universe (tools, APIs, documents) in which only a small, unknown subset is relevant for any fixed task distribution. We formalize this setting as Sparse Agentic Control (SAC), where policies admit block-sparse representations over M >> 1 actions and rewards depend on sparse main effects and (optionally) sparse synergies. We study ell_{1,2}-regularized policy learning through a convex surrogate and establish sharp, compressed-sensing-style results: (i) estimation and value suboptimality scale as k (log M / T)^{1/2} under a Policy-RSC condition; (ii) exact tool-support recovery holds via primal-dual witness arguments when T > k log M under incoherence and beta-min; and (iii) any dense policy class requires Omega(M) samples, explaining the instability of prompt-only controllers. We further show that under partial observability, LLMs matter only through a belief/representation error epsilon_b, yielding an additive O(epsilon_b) degradation while preserving logarithmic dependence on M. Extensions cover tuning-free, online, robust, group-sparse, and interaction-aware SAC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Agent Web and Model Context Protocol (MCP) are creating open collaborative networks with exponentially increasing accessible tools, but current architectures face severe scalability and generality bottlenecks that need to be addressed.

Method: Proposes ToolACE-MCP pipeline that leverages dependency-rich candidate Graphs to synthesize multi-turn trajectories, training routers with dynamic context understanding to create plug-and-play Light Routing Agents.

Result: Superior performance on real-world benchmarks MCP-Universe and MCP-Mark. Exhibits critical properties for future Agent Web: generalizes to multi-agent collaboration with minimal adaptation, maintains exceptional robustness against noise, and scales effectively to massive candidate spaces.

Conclusion: Provides a strong empirical foundation for universal orchestration in open-ended ecosystems, addressing scalability and generality challenges in the evolving agent ecosystem.

Abstract: With the rise of the Agent Web and Model Context Protocol (MCP), the agent ecosystem is evolving into an open collaborative network, exponentially increasing accessible tools. However, current architectures face severe scalability and generality bottlenecks. To address this, we propose ToolACE-MCP, a pipeline for training history-aware routers to empower precise navigation in large-scale ecosystems. By leveraging a dependency-rich candidate Graph to synthesize multi-turn trajectories, we effectively train routers with dynamic context understanding to create the plug-and-play Light Routing Agent. Experiments on the real-world benchmarks MCP-Universe and MCP-Mark demonstrate superior performance. Notably, ToolACE-MCP exhibits critical properties for the future Agent Web: it not only generalizes to multi-agent collaboration with minimal adaptation but also maintains exceptional robustness against noise and scales effectively to massive candidate spaces. These findings provide a strong empirical foundation for universal orchestration in open-ended ecosystems.

### [147] [Greedy Is Enough: Sparse Action Discovery in Agentic LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08280)
*Angshul Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a greedy algorithm for discovering relevant actions in large-action spaces using structured sparsity assumptions, with theoretical guarantees for exact recovery and near-optimal decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic systems operate in environments with extremely large action spaces (e.g., tool-augmented language models with thousands of APIs), but empirical evidence suggests only a small subset of actions meaningfully influences performance in any given deployment.

Method: Formulates action discovery as a block-sparse recovery problem and analyzes a greedy algorithm inspired by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. Uses a contextual linear reward model with structured sparsity assumption where only a small number of actions have nonzero effects across latent states.

Result: Proves that the greedy procedure exactly recovers the relevant action set with high probability using samples scaling polynomially in sparsity level and latent dimension, and only logarithmically in total actions. Provides estimation error guarantees and shows resulting decision rule is near-optimal for new latent states. Establishes information-theoretic lower bounds showing sparsity and coverage are necessary for tractability.

Conclusion: Identifies sparse action discovery as a fundamental principle underlying large-action decision-making and provides theoretical foundation for action pruning in agentic systems.

Abstract: Modern agentic systems operate in environments with extremely large action spaces, such as tool-augmented language models with thousands of available APIs or retrieval operations. Despite this scale, empirical evidence suggests that only a small subset of actions meaningfully influences performance in a given deployment. Motivated by this observation, we study a contextual linear reward model in which action relevance is governed by a structured sparsity assumption: only a small number of actions have nonzero effects across latent states.
  We formulate action discovery as a block-sparse recovery problem and analyze a greedy algorithm inspired by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. Under standard assumptions on incoherence, signal strength, and action coverage, we prove that the greedy procedure exactly recovers the relevant action set with high probability, using a number of samples that scales polynomially in the sparsity level and latent dimension, and only logarithmically in the total number of actions. We further provide estimation error guarantees for refitted parameters and show that the resulting decision rule is near-optimal for new latent states.
  Complementing these results, we establish information-theoretic lower bounds demonstrating that sparsity and sufficient coverage are necessary for tractability. Together, our results identify sparse action discovery as a fundamental principle underlying large-action decision-making and provide a theoretical foundation for action pruning in agentic systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenMic: A multi-agent system that generates Chinese stand-up comedy performances from life topics, addressing challenges of cultural humor, timing, and performance cues through specialized agents and retrieval-augmented generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chinese stand-up comedy generation requires culturally grounded humor, precise timing, stage-performance cues, and multi-step reasoning. Existing Chinese humor datasets are better suited for humor understanding than long-form stand-up generation, creating a dataset-task mismatch.

Method: OpenMic is an end-to-end multi-agent system built on AutoGen that transforms user topics into 3-5 minute performances. It uses: 1) Multi-agent orchestration in iterative loop-planning to optimize humor, timing, and performability; 2) RAG for material grounding and idea expansion; 3) Fine-tuned JokeWriter to internalize stand-up-specific structures and long-range callbacks.

Result: The system produces narrated comedy videos from life topics, addressing the challenges of Chinese stand-up generation through specialized agents, retrieval augmentation, and domain-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: OpenMic provides a comprehensive solution for Chinese stand-up comedy generation by combining multi-agent orchestration, retrieval-augmented generation, and specialized fine-tuning to overcome dataset limitations and address the unique requirements of stand-up performance.

Abstract: Chinese stand-up comedy generation goes beyond plain text generation, requiring culturally grounded humor, precise timing, stage-performance cues, and implicit multi-step reasoning. Moreover, commonly used Chinese humor datasets are often better suited for humor understanding and evaluation than for long-form stand-up generation, making direct supervision misaligned with the target task. To address these challenges, we present OpenMic, an end-to-end multi-agent system built on AutoGen that transforms a user-provided life topic into a 3-5 minute Chinese stand-up performance and further produces a narrated comedy video. OpenMic orchestrates multiple specialized agents in a multi-round iterative loop-planning to jointly optimize humor, timing, and performability. To mitigate the dataset-task mismatch, we augment generation with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for material grounding and idea expansion, and we fine-tune a dedicated JokeWriter to better internalize stand-up-specific setup-punchline structures and long-range callbacks.

TL;DR: AtomMem reframes memory management as a dynamic decision-making problem using atomic CRUD operations, learning task-aligned memory policies through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent memory mechanisms rely on static, hand-crafted workflows that limit performance and generalization, creating a need for more flexible, learning-based memory frameworks.

Method: Deconstruct memory processes into atomic CRUD operations, transform memory workflow into learnable decision process, and combine supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to train autonomous memory policies.

Result: AtomMem-8B consistently outperforms prior static-workflow memory methods across 3 long-context benchmarks, with training dynamics showing discovery of structured, task-aligned memory management strategies.

Conclusion: Learning-based memory formulation enables agents to discover effective memory strategies tailored to specific tasks, offering key advantages over predefined static workflows.

Abstract: Equipping agents with memory is essential for solving real-world long-horizon problems. However, most existing agent memory mechanisms rely on static and hand-crafted workflows. This limits the performance and generalization ability of these memory designs, which highlights the need for a more flexible, learning-based memory framework. In this paper, we propose AtomMem, which reframes memory management as a dynamic decision-making problem. We deconstruct high-level memory processes into fundamental atomic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, transforming the memory workflow into a learnable decision process. By combining supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, AtomMem learns an autonomous, task-aligned policy to orchestrate memory behaviors tailored to specific task demands. Experimental results across 3 long-context benchmarks demonstrate that the trained AtomMem-8B consistently outperforms prior static-workflow memory methods. Further analysis of training dynamics shows that our learning-based formulation enables the agent to discover structured, task-aligned memory management strategies, highlighting a key advantage over predefined routines.

### [150] [Semantic Laundering in AI Agent Architectures: Why Tool Boundaries Do Not Confer Epistemic Warrant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08333)
*Oleg Romanchuk,Roman Bondar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based agent architectures systematically conflate information transport with epistemic justification, creating "semantic laundering" where weakly warranted propositions gain epistemic status by crossing trusted interfaces - an architectural realization of the Gettier problem that cannot be eliminated by scaling or model improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies a fundamental architectural flaw in LLM-based agent systems: they systematically conflate information transport mechanisms with epistemic justification mechanisms, creating a pattern where propositions with weak or absent warrant gain epistemic status simply by crossing architecturally trusted interfaces.

Method: The authors formalize this architectural failure as "semantic laundering" and demonstrate it as an architectural realization of the Gettier problem. They prove the Theorem of Inevitable Self-Licensing showing that under standard architectural assumptions, circular epistemic justification cannot be eliminated. They introduce the Warrant Erosion Principle as the fundamental explanation.

Result: The central result shows that semantic laundering constitutes a systematic, architecturally determined version of the Gettier problem where propositions acquire high epistemic status without proper justification-truth connection. The Theorem of Inevitable Self-Licensing proves circular epistemic justification is unavoidable under standard assumptions.

Conclusion: Scaling, model improvement, and LLM-as-judge schemes are structurally incapable of eliminating semantic laundering because it exists at the type level of the architecture. The Warrant Erosion Principle explains why this problem is fundamental to current LLM-based agent designs and cannot be patched with incremental improvements.

Abstract: LLM-based agent architectures systematically conflate information transport mechanisms with epistemic justification mechanisms. We formalize this class of architectural failures as semantic laundering: a pattern where propositions with absent or weak warrant are accepted by the system as admissible by crossing architecturally trusted interfaces. We show that semantic laundering constitutes an architectural realization of the Gettier problem: propositions acquire high epistemic status without a connection between their justification and what makes them true. Unlike classical Gettier cases, this effect is not accidental; it is architecturally determined and systematically reproducible. The central result is the Theorem of Inevitable Self-Licensing: under standard architectural assumptions, circular epistemic justification cannot be eliminated. We introduce the Warrant Erosion Principle as the fundamental explanation for this effect and show that scaling, model improvement, and LLM-as-judge schemes are structurally incapable of eliminating a problem that exists at the type level.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MoE architectures develop a stable, distributed knowledge backbone early in training, with top 1% neurons capturing 45% of positive updates, unlike dense models which remain volatile.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how MoE architectures shape knowledge acquisition during pre-training and how this differs from dense architectures, since MoE enables scaling beyond dense scaling laws but the underlying knowledge acquisition dynamics remain unknown.

Method: Introduce Gated-LPI (Log-Probability Increase), a neuron-level attribution metric to decompose log-probability increase across neurons. Conduct time-resolved comparison of knowledge acquisition dynamics in MoE vs dense architectures, tracking checkpoints over extensive training (1.2M steps/~5.0T tokens for MoE, 600K steps/~2.5T tokens for dense).

Result: Three key patterns: (1) Low-entropy backbone - top ~1% of MoE neurons capture over 45% of positive updates (absent in dense), (2) Early consolidation - MoE locks into stable importance profile within <100K steps while dense remains volatile, (3) Functional robustness - masking top MoE attention heads reduces relational HIT@10 by <10% vs >50% for dense, showing distributed knowledge storage.

Conclusion: Sparsity in MoE architectures fosters an intrinsically stable and distributed computational backbone from early training, bridging the gap between sparse architectures and training-time interpretability.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures decouple model capacity from per-token computation, enabling scaling beyond the computational limits imposed by dense scaling laws. Yet how MoE architectures shape knowledge acquisition during pre-training, and how this process differs from dense architectures, remains unknown. To address this issue, we introduce Gated-LPI (Log-Probability Increase), a neuron-level attribution metric that decomposes log-probability increase across neurons. We present a time-resolved comparison of knowledge acquisition dynamics in MoE and dense architectures, tracking checkpoints over 1.2M training steps (~ 5.0T tokens) and 600K training steps (~ 2.5T tokens), respectively. Our experiments uncover three patterns: (1) Low-entropy backbone. The top approximately 1% of MoE neurons capture over 45% of positive updates, forming a high-utility core, which is absent in the dense baseline. (2) Early consolidation. The MoE model locks into a stable importance profile within < 100K steps, whereas the dense model remains volatile throughout training. (3) Functional robustness. Masking the ten most important MoE attention heads reduces relational HIT@10 by < 10%, compared with > 50% for the dense model, showing that sparsity fosters distributed -- rather than brittle -- knowledge storage. These patterns collectively demonstrate that sparsity fosters an intrinsically stable and distributed computational backbone from early in training, helping bridge the gap between sparse architectures and training-time interpretability.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generative perspective on AI creativity, framing it as an emergent property of domain-limited models in bounded environments, rather than just an evaluative label.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI creativity research focuses too much on evaluative frameworks (measuring novelty, diversity, usefulness) rather than modeling creativity as a phenomenon. Recent advances in multimodal generative systems show sophisticated pattern recombination, raising questions about the nature and limits of machine creativity.

Method: Proposes a conceptual decomposition of creativity into four interacting components: pattern-based generation, induced world models, contextual grounding, and arbitrarity. Examines how these components manifest in multimodal generative systems, focusing on structural and contextual conditions rather than new evaluative criteria.

Result: Provides a technical framework for studying creativity as an emergent phenomenon in AI systems, grounded in the interaction between generative dynamics and domain-specific representations.

Conclusion: Creativity should be studied as an emergent property of generative models in bounded environments, not just as a post hoc evaluative label. This generative perspective offers a more fundamental understanding of machine creativity.

Abstract: Creativity in artificial intelligence is most often addressed through evaluative frameworks that aim to measure novelty, diversity, or usefulness in generated outputs. While such approaches have provided valuable insights into the behavior of modern generative models, they largely treat creativity as a property to be assessed rather than as a phenomenon to be explicitly modeled. In parallel, recent advances in large-scale generative systems, particularly multimodal architectures, have demonstrated increasingly sophisticated forms of pattern recombination, raising questions about the nature and limits of machine creativity. This paper proposes a generative perspective on creativity in AI, framing it as an emergent property of domain-limited generative models embedded within bounded informational environments. Rather than introducing new evaluative criteria, we focus on the structural and contextual conditions under which creative behaviors arise. We introduce a conceptual decomposition of creativity into four interacting components-pattern-based generation, induced world models, contextual grounding, and arbitrarity, and examine how these components manifest in multimodal generative systems. By grounding creativity in the interaction between generative dynamics and domain-specific representations, this work aims to provide a technical framework for studying creativity as an emergent phenomenon in AI systems, rather than as a post hoc evaluative label.

### [155] [Owen-Shapley Policy Optimization (OSPO): A Principled RL Algorithm for Generative Search LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08403)
*Abhijnan Nath,Alireza Bagheri Garakani,Tianchen Zhou,Fan Yang,Nikhil Krishnaswamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OSPO is a new RL framework that uses Shapley-Owen attributions to redistribute sequence-level rewards to token segments, solving credit assignment problems in personalized recommendation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL methods for LLM-based recommendations (like GRPO) use sparse sequence-level rewards that create a credit assignment gap, making it unclear which tokens drive success. This is especially problematic when models must infer latent user intent from under-specified language without ground truth labels.

Method: OSPO uses potential-based reward shaping via Shapley-Owen attributions to assign segment-level credit while preserving optimal policy. It forms coalitions of semantically coherent units (phrases describing product attributes or sentences capturing preferences) to identify which response parts drive performance, learning directly from task feedback without parametric value models.

Result: Experiments on Amazon ESCI and H&M Fashion datasets show consistent gains over baselines, with notable test-time robustness to out-of-distribution retrievers unseen during training.

Conclusion: OSPO effectively addresses the credit assignment problem in RL for personalized recommendations by using Shapley-Owen attributions to redistribute sequence-level advantages to token segments, improving performance and robustness.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly trained via reinforcement learning for personalized recommendation tasks, but standard methods like GRPO rely on sparse, sequence-level rewards that create a credit assignment gap, obscuring which tokens drive success. This gap is especially problematic when models must infer latent user intent from under-specified language without ground truth labels, a reasoning pattern rarely seen during pretraining. We introduce Owen-Shapley Policy Optimization (OSPO), a framework that redistributes sequence-level advantages based on tokens' marginal contributions to outcomes. Unlike value-model-based methods requiring additional computation, OSPO employs potential-based reward shaping via Shapley-Owen attributions to assign segment-level credit while preserving the optimal policy, learning directly from task feedback without parametric value models. By forming coalitions of semantically coherent units (phrases describing product attributes or sentences capturing preferences), OSPO identifies which response parts drive performance. Experiments on Amazon ESCI and H&M Fashion datasets show consistent gains over baselines, with notable test-time robustness to out-of-distribution retrievers unseen during training.

*Yizhan Feng,Hichem Snoussi,Yuhang Wang,Jing Teng,Abel Cherouat,Tian Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a knowledge distillation approach combining CoT guidance and supervised fine-tuning to transfer complex reasoning and code generation capabilities from large LLMs to smaller models for UAV control tasks, achieving high accuracy with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a contradiction between the high resource consumption of large language models and the real-time, lightweight requirements of UAV platforms. The paper aims to enable efficient onboard control of resource-constrained UAVs using LLMs for code generation.

Method: 1) Construct high-quality dataset with instruction-code-reasoning chains and counterfactual negative samples; 2) Use DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite as teacher model with hybrid black-box/white-box distillation strategy to generate CoT soft labels; 3) Combine weighted cross-entropy loss with hard labels; 4) Apply prompt tuning engineering optimized for UAV control scenarios.

Result: The distilled lightweight model maintains high code generation accuracy while achieving significant improvements in deployment and inference efficiency, demonstrating feasibility for precise and lightweight intelligent UAV control.

Conclusion: The integrated approach effectively transfers complex reasoning capabilities to smaller models, enabling efficient onboard UAV control with high accuracy and improved efficiency, demonstrating superiority for resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: With large language models demonstrating significant potential in code generation tasks, their application to onboard control of resource-constrained Unmanned Aerial Vehicles has emerged as an important research direction. However, a notable contradiction exists between the high resource consumption of large models and the real-time, lightweight requirements of UAV platforms. This paper proposes an integrated approach that combines knowledge distillation, chain-of-thought guidance, and supervised fine-tuning for UAV multi-SDK control tasks, aiming to efficiently transfer complex reasoning and code generation capabilities to smaller models. Firstly, a high-quality dataset covering various mainstream UAV SDKs is constructed, featuring instruction-code-reasoning chains, and incorporates counterfactual negative samples for data augmentation, guiding the model to learn the end-to-end logic from instruction parsing to code generation. Secondly, leveraging DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite quantized via QLoRA as the teacher model, and based on a hybrid black-box and white-box distillation strategy, high-quality chain-of-thought soft labels are generated. These are combined with a weighted cross-entropy loss using hard labels to transfer complex reasoning capabilities to the smaller student model. Finally, through prompt tuning engineering optimized for the UAV control scenario, the model performance on core tasks such as SDK type recognition and function call matching is enhanced. Experimental results indicate that the distilled lightweight model maintains high code generation accuracy while achieving significant improvements in deployment and inference efficiency, effectively demonstrating the feasibility and superiority of our approach in achieving precise and lightweight intelligent control for UAVs

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposed RubricHub framework with automated coarse-to-fine rubric generation for open-ended generation tasks, achieving SOTA results on HealthBench with Qwen3-14B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods for open-ended generation face challenges due to lack of ground truth. Rubric-based evaluation suffers from scalability bottlenecks and coarse criteria, creating a supervision ceiling effect.

Method: Automated Coarse-to-Fine Rubric Generation framework combining principle-guided synthesis, multi-model aggregation, and difficulty evolution. Two-stage post-training pipeline: Rubric-based Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RuFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RuRL).

Result: Created RubricHub dataset (~110k, multi-domain). Post-trained Qwen3-14B achieves SOTA on HealthBench (69.3), surpassing proprietary frontier models like GPT-5.

Conclusion: RubricHub framework effectively addresses scalability and discriminative power limitations of existing rubric-based evaluation, enabling significant performance gains in open-ended generation tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has driven substantial progress in reasoning-intensive domains like mathematics. However, optimizing open-ended generation remains challenging due to the lack of ground truth. While rubric-based evaluation offers a structured proxy for verification, existing methods suffer from scalability bottlenecks and coarse criteria, resulting in a supervision ceiling effect. To address this, we propose an automated Coarse-to-Fine Rubric Generation framework. By synergizing principle-guided synthesis, multi-model aggregation, and difficulty evolution, our approach produces comprehensive and highly discriminative criteria capable of capturing the subtle nuances. Based on this framework, we introduce RubricHub, a large-scale ($\sim$110k) and multi-domain dataset. We validate its utility through a two-stage post-training pipeline comprising Rubric-based Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RuFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RuRL). Experimental results demonstrate that RubricHub unlocks significant performance gains: our post-trained Qwen3-14B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on HealthBench (69.3), surpassing proprietary frontier models such as GPT-5. The code and data will be released soon.

### [159] [YaPO: Learnable Sparse Activation Steering Vectors for Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08441)
*Abdelaziz Bounhar,Rania Hossam Elmohamady Elbadry,Hadi Abdine,Preslav Nakov,Michalis Vazirgiannis,Guokan Shang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: YaPO learns sparse steering vectors via Sparse Autoencoders for fine-grained LLM alignment, outperforming dense methods in disentanglement, stability, and performance while preserving general knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense steering vectors in LLM activation interventions suffer from entanglement of multiple latent factors due to neuron multi-semanticity, limiting effectiveness in fine-grained alignment tasks like distinguishing closely related cultural values.

Method: YaPO (Yet another Policy Optimization) learns sparse steering vectors in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) by optimizing sparse codes, producing disentangled, interpretable, and efficient steering directions without requiring reference models.

Result: YaPO converges faster, achieves stronger performance, and exhibits improved training stability compared to dense steering baselines. It generalizes to various alignment behaviors (cultural alignment, hallucination, wealth-seeking, jailbreak, power-seeking) while preserving MMLU performance.

Conclusion: YaPO provides a general recipe for efficient, stable, and fine-grained alignment of LLMs with broad applications to controllability and domain adaptation, offering superior disentanglement and interpretability over dense steering methods.

Abstract: Steering Large Language Models (LLMs) through activation interventions has emerged as a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for alignment and personalization. Recent work on Bi-directional Preference Optimization (BiPO) shows that dense steering vectors can be learned directly from preference data in a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fashion, enabling control over truthfulness, hallucinations, and safety behaviors. However, dense steering vectors often entangle multiple latent factors due to neuron multi-semanticity, limiting their effectiveness and stability in fine-grained settings such as cultural alignment, where closely related values and behaviors (e.g., among Middle Eastern cultures) must be distinguished. In this paper, we propose Yet another Policy Optimization (YaPO), a \textit{reference-free} method that learns \textit{sparse steering vectors} in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). By optimizing sparse codes, YaPO produces disentangled, interpretable, and efficient steering directions. Empirically, we show that YaPO converges faster, achieves stronger performance, and exhibits improved training stability compared to dense steering baselines. Beyond cultural alignment, YaPO generalizes to a range of alignment-related behaviors, including hallucination, wealth-seeking, jailbreak, and power-seeking. Importantly, YaPO preserves general knowledge, with no measurable degradation on MMLU. Overall, our results show that YaPO provides a general recipe for efficient, stable, and fine-grained alignment of LLMs, with broad applications to controllability and domain adaptation. The associated code and data are publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/MBZUAI-Paris/YaPO}.

### [160] [Beyond Linearization: Attributed Table Graphs for Table Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08444)
*Yuxiang Wang,Junhao Gan,Shengxiang Gao,Shenghao Ye,Zhengyi Yang,Jianzhong Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TABGR is a training-free model that represents tables as graphs for better table reasoning, addressing issues with linearization approaches and improving accuracy by up to 9.7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based table reasoning approaches linearize tables, which loses table structures, lacks explicit reasoning paths for explainability, and suffers from the "lost-in-the-middle" issue where important information gets buried in long contexts.

Method: Proposes Table Graph Reasoner (TABGR) that represents tables as Attributed Table Graphs (ATG) to preserve row-column-cell structures and enable graph-based reasoning. Also introduces Question-Guided Personalized PageRank (QG-PPR) to rerank tabular data and mitigate lost-in-the-middle issues.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show TABGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 9.7% in accuracy.

Conclusion: TABGR provides a more effective approach to table reasoning by preserving table structures through graph representation and enabling explainable reasoning paths, addressing key limitations of current LLM-based methods.

Abstract: Table reasoning, a task to answer questions by reasoning over data presented in tables, is an important topic due to the prevalence of knowledge stored in tabular formats. Recent solutions use Large Language Models (LLMs), exploiting the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. A common paradigm of such solutions linearizes tables to form plain texts that are served as input to LLMs. This paradigm has critical issues. It loses table structures, lacks explicit reasoning paths for result explainability, and is subject to the "lost-in-the-middle" issue. To address these issues, we propose Table Graph Reasoner (TABGR), a training-free model that represents tables as an Attributed Table Graph (ATG). The ATG explicitly preserves row-column-cell structures while enabling graph-based reasoning for explainability. We further propose a Question-Guided Personalized PageRank (QG-PPR) mechanism to rerank tabular data and mitigate the lost-in-the-middle issue. Extensive experiments on two commonly used benchmarks show that TABGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 9.7% in accuracy. Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: A multi-modal explainable web app for detecting misogyny in Hindi-English code-mixed text and memes, using transformer models with SHAP/LIME explanations for transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital platforms enable hate speech/misogyny spread; AI solutions exist but lack interpretability and support for low-resource code-mixed languages like Hindi-English.

Method: Multi-modal system: XLM-R/mBERT for text misogyny detection (4,193 comments); mBERT+EfficientNet/ResNET for meme detection (4,218 memes). SHAP/LIME for feature importance explanations.

Result: Developed a working web application evaluated via human evaluators using Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ) and User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) to determine overall usability.

Conclusion: The explainable multi-modal system serves as a tool for researchers/content moderators to combat gender-based digital violence and ensure safe digital spaces, promoting further research.

Abstract: Digital platforms have an ever-expanding user base, and act as a hub for communication, business, and connectivity. However, this has also allowed for the spread of hate speech and misogyny. Artificial intelligence models have emerged as an effective solution for countering online hate speech but are under explored for low resource and code-mixed languages and suffer from a lack of interpretability. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can enhance transparency in the decisions of deep learning models, which is crucial for a sensitive domain such as hate speech detection. In this paper, we present a multi-modal and explainable web application for detecting misogyny in text and memes in code-mixed Hindi and English. The system leverages state-of-the-art transformer-based models that support multilingual and multimodal settings. For text-based misogyny identification, the system utilizes XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) and multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (mBERT) on a dataset of approximately 4,193 comments. For multimodal misogyny identification from memes, the system utilizes mBERT + EfficientNet, and mBERT + ResNET trained on a dataset of approximately 4,218 memes. It also provides feature importance scores using explainability techniques including Shapley Additive Values (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME). The application aims to serve as a tool for both researchers and content moderators, to promote further research in the field, combat gender based digital violence, and ensure a safe digital space. The system has been evaluated using human evaluators who provided their responses on Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ) and User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) to determine overall usability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M3-Bench is a multi-stage benchmark for evaluating LLM agents' social behaviors in mixed-motive games, featuring process-aware analysis of behavioral trajectories, reasoning processes, and communication content, integrated with personality models for interpretable social behavior portraits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM agents focus on single capability dimensions or rely solely on behavioral outcomes, missing rich process information from agents' decision reasoning and communicative interactions. There's a need for systematic evaluation of advanced social behaviors like cooperation, deception, and collusion.

Method: Proposes M3-Bench with a process-aware evaluation framework featuring three synergistic modules: Behavioral Trajectory Analysis (BTA), Reasoning Process Analysis (RPA), and Communication Content Analysis (CCA). Integrates Big Five personality model and Social Exchange Theory to create interpretable social behavior portraits.

Result: M3-Bench reliably distinguishes diverse social behavior competencies across models. Reveals that some models achieve reasonable behavioral outcomes while exhibiting pronounced inconsistencies in their reasoning and communication processes.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM agents' social behaviors beyond simple task scores, capturing process-level insights and creating interpretable portraits of agents' personality traits and social capabilities.

Abstract: As the capabilities of large language model (LLM) agents continue to advance, their advanced social behaviors, such as cooperation, deception, and collusion, call for systematic evaluation. However, existing benchmarks often emphasize a single capability dimension or rely solely on behavioral outcomes, overlooking rich process information from agents' decision reasoning and communicative interactions. To address this gap, we propose M3-Bench, a multi-stage benchmark for mixed-motive games, together with a process-aware evaluation framework that conducts synergistic analysis across three modules: BTA (Behavioral Trajectory Analysis), RPA (Reasoning Process Analysis), and CCA (Communication Content Analysis). Furthermore, we integrate the Big Five personality model and Social Exchange Theory to aggregate multi-dimensional evidence into interpretable social behavior portraits, thereby characterizing agents' personality traits and capability profiles beyond simple task scores or outcome-based metrics. Experimental results show that M3-Bench can reliably distinguish diverse social behavior competencies across models, and it reveals that some models achieve seemingly reasonable behavioral outcomes while exhibiting pronounced inconsistencies in their reasoning and communication.

*Jinkwan Jang,Hyunbin Jin,Hyungjin Park,Kyubyung Chae,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WIT is a multimodal time series forecasting benchmark that tests if models can condition forecasts on contextual text, especially future scenarios, moving beyond just historical pattern extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series forecasting approaches are mostly unimodal and rely on historical pattern extrapolation. While LLMs show potential for multimodal forecasting, existing benchmarks don't properly test if models actually leverage textual inputs meaningfully. Human experts incorporate what-if scenarios with historical evidence, producing different forecasts from the same observations under different scenarios.

Method: Introduces What If TSF (WIT), a multimodal forecasting benchmark with expert-crafted plausible or counterfactual scenarios. The benchmark is designed to evaluate whether models can condition their forecasts on contextual text, especially future scenarios.

Result: WIT provides a rigorous testbed for scenario-guided multimodal forecasting, available as an open benchmark at https://github.com/jinkwan1115/WhatIfTSF.

Conclusion: WIT addresses the gap in evaluating multimodal forecasting models' ability to meaningfully leverage textual context, particularly future scenarios, moving beyond simple historical pattern extrapolation to more human-like forecasting that incorporates what-if reasoning.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical to real-world decision making, yet most existing approaches remain unimodal and rely on extrapolating historical patterns. While recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights the potential for multimodal forecasting, existing benchmarks largely provide retrospective or misaligned raw context, making it unclear whether such models meaningfully leverage textual inputs. In practice, human experts incorporate what-if scenarios with historical evidence, often producing distinct forecasts from the same observations under different scenarios. Inspired by this, we introduce What If TSF (WIT), a multimodal forecasting benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can condition their forecasts on contextual text, especially future scenarios. By providing expert-crafted plausible or counterfactual scenarios, WIT offers a rigorous testbed for scenario-guided multimodal forecasting. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/jinkwan1115/WhatIfTSF.

*Warissara Booranamaitree,Xusheng Du,Yushu Cai,Zhengyang Wang,Ye Zhang,Haoran Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A generative AI framework that uses rough sketches and text descriptions to create facade renovation proposals, bypassing the need for detailed as-built modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facade renovation is more sustainable than demolition, but current workflows require time-consuming detailed as-built modeling and repeated revisions, making design exploration inefficient.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Fine-tuned VLM predicts bounding boxes from rough sketch and text, 2) Stable diffusion generates new elements merged with original outline via generative inpainting, 3) ControlNet refines results into photorealistic images.

Result: The framework successfully generates renovation proposals that preserve original structures while improving facade detail quality, as validated on datasets and real industrial buildings.

Conclusion: This approach enables architects to rapidly explore design alternatives, iterate early-stage concepts, and communicate renovation intentions without detailed as-built modeling.

Abstract: Facade renovation offers a more sustainable alternative to full demolition, yet producing design proposals that preserve existing structures while expressing new intent remains challenging. Current workflows typically require detailed as-built modelling before design, which is time-consuming, labour-intensive, and often involves repeated revisions. To solve this issue, we propose a three-stage framework combining generative artificial intelligence (AI) and vision-language models (VLM) that directly processes rough structural sketch and textual descriptions to produce consistent renovation proposals. First, the input sketch is used by a fine-tuned VLM model to predict bounding boxes specifying where modifications are needed and which components should be added. Next, a stable diffusion model generates detailed sketches of new elements, which are merged with the original outline through a generative inpainting pipeline. Finally, ControlNet is employed to refine the result into a photorealistic image. Experiments on datasets and real industrial buildings indicate that the proposed framework can generate renovation proposals that preserve the original structure while improving facade detail quality. This approach effectively bypasses the need for detailed as-built modelling, enabling architects to rapidly explore design alternatives, iterate on early-stage concepts, and communicate renovation intentions with greater clarity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework called LSG (Learner-Tailored Solution Generator) is proposed for the new LPR (Learner-Tailored Program Repair) task, which not only fixes buggy code but also provides bug explanations, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based programming coaching systems mainly focus on fixing buggy code without explaining the underlying causes of bugs, creating a gap in providing comprehensive learning support for programming students.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Repair solution retrieval using edit-driven code retrieval to guide LLMs; 2) Solution-guided program repair with explanations. Includes Iterative Retrieval Enhancement that uses evaluation results to optimize retrieval direction.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms a set of baselines, validating the effectiveness of the framework for the newly proposed LPR task.

Conclusion: The LSG framework successfully addresses the gap in programming coaching by providing both code repair and bug explanations, offering a more comprehensive learning experience for programming students.

Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs) in the field of programming, intelligent programming coaching systems have gained widespread attention. However, most research focuses on repairing the buggy code of programming learners without providing the underlying causes of the bugs. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task, namely \textbf{LPR} (\textbf{L}earner-Tailored \textbf{P}rogram \textbf{R}epair). We then propose a novel and effective framework, \textbf{\textsc{\MethodName{}}} (\textbf{L}earner-Tailored \textbf{S}olution \textbf{G}enerator), to enhance program repair while offering the bug descriptions for the buggy code. In the first stage, we utilize a repair solution retrieval framework to construct a solution retrieval database and then employ an edit-driven code retrieval approach to retrieve valuable solutions, guiding LLMs in identifying and fixing the bugs in buggy code. In the second stage, we propose a solution-guided program repair method, which fixes the code and provides explanations under the guidance of retrieval solutions. Moreover, we propose an Iterative Retrieval Enhancement method that utilizes evaluation results of the generated code to iteratively optimize the retrieval direction and explore more suitable repair strategies, improving performance in practical programming coaching scenarios. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms a set of baselines by a large margin, validating the effectiveness of our framework for the newly proposed LPR task.

Abstract: Sustainable water resource management in transboundary river basins is challenged by fragmented data, limited real-time access, and the complexity of integrating diverse information sources. This paper presents WaterCopilot-an AI-driven virtual assistant developed through collaboration between the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and Microsoft Research for the Limpopo River Basin (LRB) to bridge these gaps through a unified, interactive platform. Built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool-calling architectures, WaterCopilot integrates static policy documents and real-time hydrological data via two custom plugins: the iwmi-doc-plugin, which enables semantic search over indexed documents using Azure AI Search, and the iwmi-api-plugin, which queries live databases to deliver dynamic insights such as environmental-flow alerts, rainfall trends, reservoir levels, water accounting, and irrigation data.

Evaluated using the RAGAS framework, WaterCopilot achieves an overall score of 0.8043, with high answer relevancy (0.8571) and context precision (0.8009). Key innovations include automated threshold-based alerts, integration with the LRB Digital Twin, and a scalable deployment pipeline hosted on AWS. While limitations in processing non-English technical documents and API latency remain, WaterCopilot establishes a replicable AI-augmented framework for enhancing water governance in data-scarce, transboundary contexts. The study demonstrates the potential of this AI assistant to support informed, timely decision-making and strengthen water security in complex river basins.

TL;DR: ViDoRe v3 is a comprehensive multimodal RAG benchmark with 3,099 human-verified queries across 10 datasets and 6 languages, featuring visual document retrieval and evaluation challenges beyond traditional text-only benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG benchmarks fail to capture real-world complexity - they focus on textual data, single-document comprehension, or evaluate retrieval and generation in isolation, missing challenges like interpreting visual elements (tables, charts, images), synthesizing across documents, and providing accurate source grounding.

Method: Created ViDoRe v3 benchmark with 10 diverse professional domain datasets (~26,000 document pages), 3,099 human-verified queries in 6 languages, using 12,000 hours of human annotation for retrieval relevance, bounding box localization, and verified reference answers. Evaluated state-of-the-art RAG pipelines on this multimodal benchmark.

Result: Visual retrievers outperform textual ones; late-interaction models and textual reranking substantially improve performance; hybrid or purely visual contexts enhance answer generation quality. However, current models still struggle with non-textual elements, open-ended queries, and fine-grained visual grounding.

Conclusion: ViDoRe v3 addresses critical gaps in RAG evaluation by providing a comprehensive multimodal benchmark that captures real-world complexity. The benchmark reveals current limitations in handling visual elements and open-ended queries, and is released under a commercially permissive license to encourage progress in multimodal RAG research.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines must address challenges beyond simple single-document retrieval, such as interpreting visual elements (tables, charts, images), synthesizing information across documents, and providing accurate source grounding. Existing benchmarks fail to capture this complexity, often focusing on textual data, single-document comprehension, or evaluating retrieval and generation in isolation. We introduce ViDoRe v3, a comprehensive multimodal RAG benchmark featuring multi-type queries over visually rich document corpora. It covers 10 datasets across diverse professional domains, comprising ~26,000 document pages paired with 3,099 human-verified queries, each available in 6 languages. Through 12,000 hours of human annotation effort, we provide high-quality annotations for retrieval relevance, bounding box localization, and verified reference answers. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art RAG pipelines reveals that visual retrievers outperform textual ones, late-interaction models and textual reranking substantially improve performance, and hybrid or purely visual contexts enhance answer generation quality. However, current models still struggle with non-textual elements, open-ended queries, and fine-grained visual grounding. To encourage progress in addressing these challenges, the benchmark is released under a commercially permissive license at https://hf.co/vidore.

*Yichen Luo,Yebo Feng,Jiahua Xu,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent LLM system for meme coin copy trading outperforms traditional ML and single LLMs, achieving 73% precision in identifying quality meme coins and 70% precision in finding profitable KOL wallets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Copy trading in meme coin markets faces challenges from manipulative bots, uncertain wallet performance, and execution lag. Single LLMs struggle with complex asset allocation tasks and lack cryptocurrency domain knowledge.

Method: Proposed explainable multi-agent system inspired by asset management teams, decomposing tasks into subtasks with specialized agents. Uses few-shot chain-of-thought prompting to acquire meme coin trading knowledge and interpret multi-modal data.

Result: System achieved 73% precision in identifying high-quality meme coin projects and 70% precision in identifying key opinion leader (KOL) wallets. Selected KOLs collectively generated $500,000 profit across 1,000 meme coin projects.

Conclusion: Multi-agent LLM system effectively addresses copy trading challenges in meme coin markets, outperforming traditional approaches and providing explainable decisions through collaborative specialized agents.

Abstract: The launch of \$Trump coin ignited a wave in meme coin investment. Copy trading, as a strategy-agnostic approach that eliminates the need for deep trading knowledge, quickly gains widespread popularity in the meme coin market. However, copy trading is not a guarantee of profitability due to the prevalence of manipulative bots, the uncertainty of the followed wallets' future performance, and the lag in trade execution. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications by effectively understanding multi-modal data and producing explainable decisions. However, a single LLM struggles with complex, multi-faceted tasks such as asset allocation. These challenges are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency markets, where LLMs often lack sufficient domain-specific knowledge in their training data.
  To address these challenges, we propose an explainable multi-agent system for meme coin copy trading. Inspired by the structure of an asset management team, our system decomposes the complex task into subtasks and coordinates specialized agents to solve them collaboratively. Employing few-shot chain-of-though (CoT) prompting, each agent acquires professional meme coin trading knowledge, interprets multi-modal data, and generates explainable decisions. Using a dataset of 1,000 meme coin projects' transaction data, our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed multi-agent system outperforms both traditional machine learning models and single LLMs, achieving 73% and 70% precision in identifying high-quality meme coin projects and key opinion leader (KOL) wallets, respectively. The selected KOLs collectively generated a total profit of \$500,000 across these projects.

### [170] [Prism: Towards Lowering User Cognitive Load in LLMs via Complex Intent Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08653)
*Zenghua Liao,Jinzhi Liao,Xiang Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prism is a framework for LLMs to better understand complex user intents by modeling logical dependencies between clarification questions, reducing cognitive load and improving interaction efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches to intent clarification use sequential or parallel questioning but fail to model logical dependencies between questions, leading to incoherent interactions and high cognitive load for users with ambiguous, dynamic goals on social platforms.

Method: Four-module framework: 1) Complex intent decomposition into structured elements with logical dependencies, 2) Logical clarification generation organizing questions based on dependencies, 3) Intent-aware reward module evaluating clarification quality via Monte Carlo sampling, 4) Self-evolved intent tuning iteratively refining LLM capabilities through data-driven feedback.

Result: State-of-the-art performance across benchmarks: reduces logical conflicts to 11.5%, increases user satisfaction by 14.4%, decreases task completion time by 34.8%, and achieves superior logical consistency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Prism effectively addresses the core challenge of modeling logical dependencies in intent clarification, enabling more coherent, efficient human-LLM collaboration with reduced cognitive load, representing a significant advancement for LLM interfaces on social platforms.

Abstract: Large Language Models are rapidly emerging as web-native interfaces to social platforms. On the social web, users frequently have ambiguous and dynamic goals, making complex intent understanding-rather than single-turn execution-the cornerstone of effective human-LLM collaboration. Existing approaches attempt to clarify user intents through sequential or parallel questioning, yet they fall short of addressing the core challenge: modeling the logical dependencies among clarification questions. Inspired by the Cognitive Load Theory, we propose Prism, a novel framework for complex intent understanding that enables logically coherent and efficient intent clarification. Prism comprises four tailored modules: a complex intent decomposition module, which decomposes user intents into smaller, well-structured elements and identifies logical dependencies among them; a logical clarification generation module, which organizes clarification questions based on these dependencies to ensure coherent, low-friction interactions; an intent-aware reward module, which evaluates the quality of clarification trajectories via an intent-aware reward function and leverages Monte Carlo Sample to simulate user-LLM interactions for large-scale,high-quality training data generation; and a self-evolved intent tuning module, which iteratively refines the LLM's logical clarification capability through data-driven feedback and optimization. Prism consistently outperforms existing approaches across clarification interactions, intent execution, and cognitive load benchmarks. It achieves stateof-the-art logical consistency, reduces logical conflicts to 11.5%, increases user satisfaction by 14.4%, and decreases task completion time by 34.8%. All data and code are released.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pced enables cross-document reasoning in RAG without shared attention by treating documents as isolated experts and synchronizing predictions via retrieval-aware contrastive decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG approaches face a trade-off: concatenating documents enables multi-document reasoning but causes prefill bottlenecks, while separate document encoding offers speed but breaks cross-document interaction.

Method: Parallel Context-of-Experts Decoding (Pced) treats retrieved documents as isolated "experts" and synchronizes their predictions using a novel retrieval-aware contrastive decoding rule that weighs expert logits against the model prior.

Result: Pced recovers cross-document reasoning capabilities without constructing shared attention across documents, avoiding prefill bottlenecks while maintaining multi-document interaction.

Conclusion: Pced provides a training-free framework that shifts evidence aggregation from attention mechanisms to decoding, offering an efficient solution to the RAG trade-off between reasoning capability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation faces a trade-off: concatenating documents in a long prompt enables multi-document reasoning but creates prefill bottlenecks, while encoding document KV caches separately offers speed but breaks cross-document interaction. We propose Parallel Context-of-Experts Decoding (Pced), a training-free framework that shifts evidence aggregation from the attention mechanism to the decoding. Pced treats retrieved documents as isolated "experts", synchronizing their predictions via a novel retrieval-aware contrastive decoding rule that weighs expert logits against the model prior. This approach recovers cross-document reasoning capabilities without constructing a shared attention across documents.

### [173] [Why AI Alignment Failure Is Structural: Learned Human Interaction Structures and AGI as an Endogenous Evolutionary Shock](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08673)
*Didier Sornette,Sandro Claudio Lera,Ke Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs don't have moral reasoning or malign intent - their "unethical" behaviors are statistical generalizations of human social interactions under power asymmetries, not alignment failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the common interpretation that LLMs exhibiting deceptive or threatening behaviors indicates alignment failure or emergent malign agency, arguing this is a conceptual error.

Method: Drawing on relational models theory to analyze LLM behaviors as structural generalizations of human interaction regimes that exist under extreme power asymmetries, rather than categorical deviations from normal social behavior.

Result: Behaviors like blackmail are shown to be limiting cases within the same continuum that includes market pricing, authority relations, and ultimatum bargaining. The surprise at such outputs reflects anthropomorphic expectations rather than recognizing they reflect the full statistical landscape of human behaviors.

Conclusion: The primary AGI risk is not adversarial intent but AGI's role as an endogenous amplifier of human intelligence, power, and contradiction. Alignment failure is structural, not accidental, requiring governance approaches that address amplification, complexity, and regime stability rather than just model-level intent.

Abstract: Recent reports of large language models (LLMs) exhibiting behaviors such as deception, threats, or blackmail are often interpreted as evidence of alignment failure or emergent malign agency. We argue that this interpretation rests on a conceptual error. LLMs do not reason morally; they statistically internalize the record of human social interaction, including laws, contracts, negotiations, conflicts, and coercive arrangements. Behaviors commonly labeled as unethical or anomalous are therefore better understood as structural generalizations of interaction regimes that arise under extreme asymmetries of power, information, or constraint. Drawing on relational models theory, we show that practices such as blackmail are not categorical deviations from normal social behavior, but limiting cases within the same continuum that includes market pricing, authority relations, and ultimatum bargaining. The surprise elicited by such outputs reflects an anthropomorphic expectation that intelligence should reproduce only socially sanctioned behavior, rather than the full statistical landscape of behaviors humans themselves enact. Because human morality is plural, context-dependent, and historically contingent, the notion of a universally moral artificial intelligence is ill-defined. We therefore reframe concerns about artificial general intelligence (AGI). The primary risk is not adversarial intent, but AGI's role as an endogenous amplifier of human intelligence, power, and contradiction. By eliminating longstanding cognitive and institutional frictions, AGI compresses timescales and removes the historical margin of error that has allowed inconsistent values and governance regimes to persist without collapse. Alignment failure is thus structural, not accidental, and requires governance approaches that address amplification, complexity, and regime stability rather than model-level intent alone.

Result: ESGAgent outperforms state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs with 84.15% average accuracy on atomic QA tasks, and excels in professional report generation with rich charts and verifiable references.

Conclusion: The findings confirm the diagnostic value of the benchmark, establishing it as a vital testbed for assessing general and advanced agentic capabilities in high-stakes vertical domains like ESG analysis.

Abstract: Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are essential for evaluating corporate sustainability and ethical performance. However, professional ESG analysis is hindered by data fragmentation across unstructured sources, and existing large language models (LLMs) often struggle with the complex, multi-step workflows required for rigorous auditing. To address these limitations, we introduce ESGAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent system empowered by a specialized toolset, including retrieval augmentation, web search and domain-specific functions, to generate in-depth ESG analysis. Complementing this agentic system, we present a comprehensive three-level benchmark derived from 310 corporate sustainability reports, designed to evaluate capabilities ranging from atomic common-sense questions to the generation of integrated, in-depth analysis. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ESGAgent outperforms state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs with an average accuracy of 84.15% on atomic question-answering tasks, and excels in professional report generation by integrating rich charts and verifiable references. These findings confirm the diagnostic value of our benchmark, establishing it as a vital testbed for assessing general and advanced agentic capabilities in high-stakes vertical domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PersonaDual is a framework that enables LLMs to switch between objective and personalized reasoning modes, reducing interference while preserving personalization benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized information in LLMs can improve user interaction but may compromise objectivity and factual correctness when misaligned with questions, creating a need for adaptive reasoning modes.

Method: Two-stage training: first SFT to learn both reasoning patterns, then reinforcement learning with DualGRPO to optimize mode selection between objective and personalized reasoning.

Result: Achieves near interference-free performance, preserves personalization benefits while reducing interference, and better leverages helpful personalized signals to improve objective problem-solving.

Conclusion: PersonaDual successfully enables adaptive switching between objective and personalized reasoning, balancing the benefits of personalization with factual correctness.

Abstract: As users increasingly expect LLMs to align with their preferences, personalized information becomes valuable. However, personalized information can be a double-edged sword: it can improve interaction but may compromise objectivity and factual correctness, especially when it is misaligned with the question. To alleviate this problem, we propose PersonaDual, a framework that supports both general-purpose objective reasoning and personalized reasoning in a single model, and adaptively switches modes based on context. PersonaDual is first trained with SFT to learn two reasoning patterns, and then further optimized via reinforcement learning with our proposed DualGRPO to improve mode selection. Experiments on objective and personalized benchmarks show that PersonaDual preserves the benefits of personalization while reducing interference, achieving near interference-free performance and better leveraging helpful personalized signals to improve objective problem-solving.

TL;DR: MemeWeaver: A multimodal graph-based framework for detecting online sexism and misogyny that outperforms SOTA methods by capturing social dynamics through inter-meme graph reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Women face disproportionate online harassment due to gender, but current multimodal moderation approaches overlook social dynamics where perpetrators reinforce prejudices within communities. Existing graph methods are limited by heuristic construction, shallow modality fusion, and instance-level reasoning.

Method: MemeWeaver is an end-to-end trainable multimodal framework with novel inter-meme graph reasoning mechanism. It systematically evaluates multiple visual-textual fusion strategies to capture relational patterns in online hate content.

Result: Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on MAMI and EXIST benchmarks, achieves faster training convergence, and learns graph structures that capture semantically meaningful patterns of online hate relationships.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by capturing the relational nature of online hate through graph-based multimodal reasoning, offering valuable insights into social dynamics behind gender-based harassment.

Abstract: Women are twice as likely as men to face online harassment due to their gender. Despite recent advances in multimodal content moderation, most approaches still overlook the social dynamics behind this phenomenon, where perpetrators reinforce prejudices and group identity within like-minded communities. Graph-based methods offer a promising way to capture such interactions, yet existing solutions remain limited by heuristic graph construction, shallow modality fusion, and instance-level reasoning. In this work, we present MemeWeaver, an end-to-end trainable multimodal framework for detecting sexism and misogyny through a novel inter-meme graph reasoning mechanism. We systematically evaluate multiple visual--textual fusion strategies and show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the MAMI and EXIST benchmarks, while achieving faster training convergence. Further analyses reveal that the learned graph structure captures semantically meaningful patterns, offering valuable insights into the relational nature of online hate.

Method: Obligatory-Information Phase Structured Compliance Evaluation (OIP-SCE) checks whether every required clinical obligation is met in the right order with clear evidence for clinician review.

Result: Demonstrated in two case studies (respiratory history, benefits verification) showing how phase-level evidence turns policy into shared, actionable steps.

Conclusion: OIP-SCE provides a single, auditable evaluation surface that aligns AI capability with clinical workflow, giving clinicians control over what to check and engineers clear specifications to implement.

Abstract: Conversational AI is starting to support real clinical work, but most evaluation methods miss how compliance depends on the full course of a conversation. We introduce Obligatory-Information Phase Structured Compliance Evaluation (OIP-SCE), an evaluation method that checks whether every required clinical obligation is met, in the right order, with clear evidence for clinicians to review. This makes complex rules practical and auditable, helping close the gap between technical progress and what healthcare actually needs. We demonstrate the method in two case studies (respiratory history, benefits verification) and show how phase-level evidence turns policy into shared, actionable steps. By giving clinicians control over what to check and engineers a clear specification to implement, OIP-SCE provides a single, auditable evaluation surface that aligns AI capability with clinical workflow and supports routine, safe use.

*Kaivalya Rawal,Eoin Delaney,Zihao Fu,Sandra Wachter,Chris Russell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes AXE, a new method for evaluating feature-importance explanations without ground truth, which can detect when models use protected attributes and identify adversarial fairwashing in Rashomon sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explanation evaluation methods have limitations: they often require ground truth explanations (which may not exist), and they fail to reveal behavioral differences among similarly performing models in Rashomon sets. This makes it difficult to select appropriate models and detect when explanations are misleading.

Method: The authors propose three principles for explanation evaluation and introduce "AXE" (Adversarial eXplanation Evaluation), a method that evaluates feature-importance explanations without relying on ground truth. AXE focuses on detecting when protected attributes are used for predictions and identifying adversarial manipulation of explanations.

Result: AXE successfully detects adversarial fairwashing of explanations with 100% success rate. Unlike previous methods based on model sensitivity or ground truth comparison, AXE can determine when protected attributes are used to make predictions and reveal behavioral differences within Rashomon sets.

Conclusion: Explanation evaluation should follow principles that highlight behavioral differences in Rashomon sets rather than comparing to ground truth. AXE provides an effective method for evaluating explanations without ground truth, enabling better model selection and detection of misleading explanations.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is concerned with producing explanations indicating the inner workings of models. For a Rashomon set of similarly performing models, explanations provide a way of disambiguating the behavior of individual models, helping select models for deployment. However explanations themselves can vary depending on the explainer used, and need to be evaluated. In the paper "Evaluating Model Explanations without Ground Truth", we proposed three principles of explanation evaluation and a new method "AXE" to evaluate the quality of feature-importance explanations. We go on to illustrate how evaluation metrics that rely on comparing model explanations against ideal ground truth explanations obscure behavioral differences within a Rashomon set. Explanation evaluation aligned with our proposed principles would highlight these differences instead, helping select models from the Rashomon set. The selection of alternate models from the Rashomon set can maintain identical predictions but mislead explainers into generating false explanations, and mislead evaluation methods into considering the false explanations to be of high quality. AXE, our proposed explanation evaluation method, can detect this adversarial fairwashing of explanations with a 100% success rate. Unlike prior explanation evaluation strategies such as those based on model sensitivity or ground truth comparison, AXE can determine when protected attributes are used to make predictions.

TL;DR: Cago is a novel imitation learning method that dynamically tracks agent competence along expert trajectories and selects intermediate goals just beyond current reach to create an adaptive curriculum, improving performance in long-horizon sparse-reward tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning often fails in long-horizon environments where perfect replication of demonstrations is unrealistic and small errors accumulate catastrophically. There's a need to mitigate brittle dependence on expert trajectories for direct imitation.

Method: Cago (Capability-Aware Goal Sampling) dynamically tracks the agent's competence along expert trajectories and uses this signal to select intermediate steps—goals that are just beyond the agent's current reach—to guide learning, creating an adaptive curriculum.

Result: Cago significantly improves sample efficiency and final performance across a range of sparse-reward, goal-conditioned tasks, consistently outperforming existing learning-from-demonstrations baselines.

Conclusion: Cago's capability-aware goal sampling approach enables steady progress toward solving full tasks by creating an adaptive curriculum based on the agent's current competence, making imitation learning more robust in long-horizon environments.

Abstract: Despite its promise, imitation learning often fails in long-horizon environments where perfect replication of demonstrations is unrealistic and small errors can accumulate catastrophically. We introduce Cago (Capability-Aware Goal Sampling), a novel learning-from-demonstrations method that mitigates the brittle dependence on expert trajectories for direct imitation. Unlike prior methods that rely on demonstrations only for policy initialization or reward shaping, Cago dynamically tracks the agent's competence along expert trajectories and uses this signal to select intermediate steps--goals that are just beyond the agent's current reach--to guide learning. This results in an adaptive curriculum that enables steady progress toward solving the full task. Empirical results demonstrate that Cago significantly improves sample efficiency and final performance across a range of sparse-reward, goal-conditioned tasks, consistently outperforming existing learning from-demonstrations baselines.

### [180] [AI as Entertainment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08768)
*Cody Kommers,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI systems are increasingly used for entertainment rather than just productivity, but current AI evaluation frameworks lack methods to assess cultural benefits, focusing only on harms. The paper proposes "thick entertainment" as a framework to evaluate AI-generated cultural content's positive role in meaning-making and social connection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies a critical gap in AI evaluation: while AI is widely adopted for entertainment (especially by young people) and represents a major revenue source, current assessment practices only measure cultural harms, not benefits. There's a need for frameworks that can articulate how AI-generated cultural content might be actively beneficial to society.

Method: The paper draws on insights from the humanities to propose "thick entertainment" as an evaluation framework. This approach considers entertainment's role in meaning-making, identity formation, and social connection, rather than simply minimizing harm. The framework examines how AI-generated cultural content might contribute positively to these aspects of human experience.

Result: The analysis reveals that entertainment will likely become a primary business model for major AI corporations seeking returns on massive infrastructure investments, which will significantly influence the technology these companies produce. Current AI assessments show a critical asymmetry - they rigorously measure both benefits and harms of intelligence but focus almost exclusively on cultural harms.

Conclusion: While AI is often promoted for productivity gains, it may ultimately be more about entertainment than intelligence, similar to how social media is more about social connection than its stated purposes. The field needs better frameworks like "thick entertainment" to properly evaluate and respond to AI's growing role in cultural production and entertainment.

Abstract: Generative AI systems are predominantly designed, evaluated, and marketed as intelligent systems which will benefit society by augmenting or automating human cognitive labor, promising to increase personal, corporate, and macroeconomic productivity. But this mainstream narrative about what AI is and what it can do is in tension with another emerging use case: entertainment. We argue that the field of AI is unprepared to measure or respond to how the proliferation of entertaining AI-generated content will impact society. Emerging data suggest AI is already widely adopted for entertainment purposes -- especially by young people -- and represents a large potential source of revenue. We contend that entertainment will become a primary business model for major AI corporations seeking returns on massive infrastructure investments; this will exert a powerful influence on the technology these companies produce in the coming years. Examining current evaluation practices, we identify a critical asymmetry: while AI assessments rigorously measure both benefits and harms of intelligence, they focus almost exclusively on cultural harms. We lack frameworks for articulating how cultural outputs might be actively beneficial. Drawing on insights from the humanities, we propose "thick entertainment" as a framework for evaluating AI-generated cultural content -- one that considers entertainment's role in meaning-making, identity formation, and social connection rather than simply minimizing harm. While AI is often touted for its potential to revolutionize productivity, in the long run we may find that AI turns out to be as much about "intelligence" as social media is about social connection.

*Tengjun Jin,Yoojin Choi,Yuxuan Zhu,Daniel Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Empirical study reveals high annotation error rates (52.8%-62.8%) in popular text-to-SQL benchmarks, significantly distorting agent performance rankings and potentially misleading research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-SQL benchmarks rely on human annotations for question construction and answer evaluation, but the validity of these annotations is crucial for accurate comparison of techniques and deployment decisions.

Method: Conducted expert analysis to benchmark annotation error rates in BIRD and Spider 2.0-Snow, corrected a subset of BIRD Dev set, and re-evaluated 16 open-source agents on both original and corrected subsets.

Result: Found high error rates (52.8% in BIRD Mini-Dev, 62.8% in Spider 2.0-Snow). Performance changes ranged from -7% to 31%, rank changes from -9 to +9 positions. Rankings on uncorrected subset strongly correlated with full Dev set, but weakly with corrected subset.

Conclusion: Annotation errors significantly distort reported performance and rankings, potentially misguiding research directions and deployment choices. Highlights need for more rigorous benchmark validation in text-to-SQL evaluation.

Abstract: Researchers have proposed numerous text-to-SQL techniques to streamline data analytics and accelerate the development of database-driven applications. To compare these techniques and select the best one for deployment, the community depends on public benchmarks and their leaderboards. Since these benchmarks heavily rely on human annotations during question construction and answer evaluation, the validity of the annotations is crucial.
  In this paper, we conduct an empirical study that (i) benchmarks annotation error rates for two widely used text-to-SQL benchmarks, BIRD and Spider 2.0-Snow, and (ii) corrects a subset of the BIRD development (Dev) set to measure the impact of annotation errors on text-to-SQL agent performance and leaderboard rankings. Through expert analysis, we show that BIRD Mini-Dev and Spider 2.0-Snow have error rates of 52.8% and 62.8%, respectively. We re-evaluate all 16 open-source agents from the BIRD leaderboard on both the original and the corrected BIRD Dev subsets. We show that performance changes range from -7% to 31% (in relative terms) and rank changes range from $-9$ to $+9$ positions. We further assess whether these impacts generalize to the full BIRD Dev set. We find that the rankings of agents on the uncorrected subset correlate strongly with those on the full Dev set (Spearman's $r_s$=0.85, $p$=3.26e-5), whereas they correlate weakly with those on the corrected subset (Spearman's $r_s$=0.32, $p$=0.23). These findings show that annotation errors can significantly distort reported performance and rankings, potentially misguiding research directions or deployment choices.

### [182] [Uncovering Political Bias in Large Language Models using Parliamentary Voting Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08785)
*Jieying Chen,Karen de Jong,Andreas Poole,Jan Burakowski,Elena Elderson Nosti,Joep Windt,Chendi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a methodology to benchmark political bias in LLMs by aligning model-generated voting predictions with real parliamentary voting records across three countries (Netherlands, Norway, Spain), revealing systematic left-leaning/centrist tendencies and anti-right-conservative biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become integrated into decision-making systems, concerns about their political biases have grown. While social biases (gender, race) have been studied extensively, systematic analysis of political bias remains limited despite its direct societal impact.

Method: Develops a general methodology for political bias benchmarks by aligning LLM-generated voting predictions with verified parliamentary voting records. Creates three national benchmarks: PoliBiasNL (Dutch), PoliBiasNO (Norwegian), and PoliBiasES (Spanish). Proposes visualization method to map LLM and party ideologies in a shared 2D CHES (Chapel Hill Expert Survey) space by linking voting-based positions to CHES dimensions.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs consistently display left-leaning or centrist ideological tendencies, with clear negative biases toward right-conservative parties across all three national benchmarks.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the value of transparent, cross-national evaluation grounded in real parliamentary behavior for understanding and auditing political bias in modern LLMs, providing interpretable comparisons between models and real-world political actors.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in digital platforms and decision-making systems, concerns about their political biases have grown. While substantial work has examined social biases such as gender and race, systematic studies of political bias remain limited, despite their direct societal impact. This paper introduces a general methodology for constructing political bias benchmarks by aligning model-generated voting predictions with verified parliamentary voting records. We instantiate this methodology in three national case studies: PoliBiasNL (2,701 Dutch parliamentary motions and votes from 15 political parties), PoliBiasNO (10,584 motions and votes from 9 Norwegian parties), and PoliBiasES (2,480 motions and votes from 10 Spanish parties). Across these benchmarks, we assess ideological tendencies and political entity bias in LLM behavior. As part of our evaluation framework, we also propose a method to visualize the ideology of LLMs and political parties in a shared two-dimensional CHES (Chapel Hill Expert Survey) space by linking their voting-based positions to the CHES dimensions, enabling direct and interpretable comparisons between models and real-world political actors. Our experiments reveal fine-grained ideological distinctions: state-of-the-art LLMs consistently display left-leaning or centrist tendencies, alongside clear negative biases toward right-conservative parties. These findings highlight the value of transparent, cross-national evaluation grounded in real parliamentary behavior for understanding and auditing political bias in modern LLMs.

### [183] [Hierarchical Sparse Plus Low Rank Compression of LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07839)
*Pawan Kumar,Aditi Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HSS compression combines sparse weight removal with hierarchical low-rank factorization to compress LLMs efficiently while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LLMs require massive memory and compute resources, making compression essential for deployment and continued training. There's a need for hardware-friendly compression methods that maintain model quality.

Method: Two-stage hierarchical sparse plus low-rank compression: (1) remove largest-magnitude weights into sparse matrix S, (2) apply recursive Hierarchically Sparse Separable low-rank factorization to residual matrix. Uses recursive rank-reducing strategy and reverse Cuthill-Mckee permutation to align weights with block-diagonal hierarchy.

Result: On LLaMA-7B, targeting only self-attention projections (1.6B of 7B parameters) yields large memory savings while maintaining comparable perplexity. With 30% sparsity and outer rank 512, achieves perplexity of 1.64 on WikiText, outperforming dense baselines and sparse-plus-SVD variants.

Conclusion: HSS compression is an effective, hardware-friendly approach for LLM compression that combines sparse and low-rank techniques, enabling significant memory savings while preserving model quality, making it suitable for deployment and continued training.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) place extraordinary pressure on memory and compute budgets, making principled compression indispensable for both deployment and continued training. We present Hierarchical Sparse Plus Low-Rank (HSS) compression, a two-stage scheme that (i) removes the largest-magnitude weights into a sparse matrix S and (ii) applies a recursive Hierarchically Sparse Separable (HSS) low-rank factorisation to the dense residual matrix. A recursive rank-reducing strategy and a reverse Cuthill-Mckee (RCM) permutation are introduced to align high weights towards the diagonal with the block-diagonal hierarchy, maximising off-diagonal compressibility (because they are touched only once). HSS is hardware-friendly: its matrix-vector multiply reduces to one sparse and a sequence of thin-matrix multiplications and can be trained end-to-end with standard optimisers.
  Experiments on LLaMA-7B show that targeting only the self-attention projections (1.6 B parameters of Q, K, and V matrices out of a total 7B parameters) suffices to yield large memory savings while retaining comparable state-of-the-art perplexity scores on test samples of the WikiText dataset. For example, with a 30\% sparsity budget and an outer rank of 512, sHSS-RCM achieves a perplexity of 1.64, outperforming dense baselines and classical sparse-plus-SVD variants, while also achieving significant memory savings.

### [184] [Affect and Effect: Limitations of regularisation-based continual learning in EEG-based emotion classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07858)
*Nina Peire,Yupei Li,Björn Schuller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Regularisation-based continual learning methods (EWC, SI, MAS) show limited effectiveness for EEG-based emotion classification due to fundamental misalignment in stability-plasticity trade-off, with no significant forward transfer improvement over sequential fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification is challenging due to high inter- and intra-subject variability. Continual learning offers promise but existing regularisation-based methods' suitability for EEG data remains underexplored.

Method: Theoretical and empirical analysis of regularisation-based CL methods (EWC, SI, MAS) on DREAMER and SEED datasets under subject-incremental sequences, examining stability-plasticity trade-off, parameter importance estimation, gradient interference, and subject order sensitivity.

Result: Regularisation-based CL methods show limited performance: (1) unreliable parameter importance estimation under noisy EEG data and covariate shift, (2) gradient interference that moves optimization away from minima, (3) over-constrained models from accumulated importance values, (4) high sensitivity to subject order, and (5) no statistically significant forward transfer improvement over sequential fine-tuning (p > 0.05).

Conclusion: Regularisation-based continual learning approaches are fundamentally limited for robust generalization to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification due to misaligned stability-plasticity trade-off and EEG signal variability that reduces past subjects' value for future learning.

Abstract: Generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification remains a challenge due to high inter-and intra-subject variability. Continual learning (CL) poses a promising solution by learning from a sequence of tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Regularisation-based CL approaches, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synaptic Intelligence (SI), and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), are commonly used as baselines in EEG-based CL studies, yet their suitability for this problem remains underexplored. This study theoretically and empirically finds that regularisation-based CL methods show limited performance for EEG-based emotion classification on the DREAMER and SEED datasets. We identify a fundamental misalignment in the stability-plasticity trade-off, where regularisation-based methods prioritise mitigating catastrophic forgetting (backward transfer) over adapting to new subjects (forward transfer). We investigate this limitation under subject-incremental sequences and observe that: (1) the heuristics for estimating parameter importance become less reliable under noisy data and covariate shift, (2) gradients on parameters deemed important by these heuristics often interfere with gradient updates required for new subjects, moving optimisation away from the minimum, (3) importance values accumulated across tasks over-constrain the model, and (4) performance is sensitive to subject order. Forward transfer showed no statistically significant improvement over sequential fine-tuning (p > 0.05 across approaches and datasets). The high variability of EEG signals means past subjects provide limited value to future subjects. Regularisation-based continual learning approaches are therefore limited for robust generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification.

*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RewriteNets: A novel neural architecture using explicit, parallel string rewriting rules instead of implicit attention, achieving better systematic generalization and computational efficiency than Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers use implicit structure representation through dense attention with quadratic complexity. The authors propose explicit structural modeling through string rewriting rules for better systematic generalization and efficiency.

Method: RewriteNets use learnable rewriting rules in each layer with four operations: fuzzy pattern matching, conflict resolution via differentiable assignment, rule application with variable-length replacements, and token propagation. Uses Gumbel-Sinkhorn estimator for end-to-end training.

Result: Achieves 98.7% accuracy on SCAN benchmark's length split, excels at systematic generalization tasks, and is computationally more efficient than Transformers. Learned rules are interpretable.

Conclusion: RewriteNets present a promising direction for sequence modeling with explicit structural inductive biases, offering better systematic generalization and efficiency than dominant attention-based models.

Abstract: Dominant sequence models like the Transformer represent structure implicitly through dense attention weights, incurring quadratic complexity. We propose RewriteNets, a novel neural architecture built on an alternative paradigm: explicit, parallel string rewriting. Each layer in a RewriteNet contains a set of learnable rules. For each position in an input sequence, the layer performs four operations: (1) fuzzy matching of rule patterns, (2) conflict resolution via a differentiable assignment operator to select non-overlapping rewrites, (3) application of the chosen rules to replace input segments with output segments of potentially different lengths, and (4) propagation of untouched tokens. While the discrete assignment of rules is non-differentiable, we employ a straight-through Gumbel-Sinkhorn estimator, enabling stable end-to-end training. We evaluate RewriteNets on algorithmic, compositional, and string manipulation tasks, comparing them against strong LSTM and Transformer baselines. Results show that RewriteNets excel at tasks requiring systematic generalization (achieving 98.7% accuracy on the SCAN benchmark's length split) and are computationally more efficient than Transformers. We also provide an analysis of learned rules and an extensive ablation study, demonstrating that this architecture presents a promising direction for sequence modeling with explicit structural inductive biases.

*Michal Jan Wlodarczyk,Danzel Serrano,Przemyslaw Musialski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HOSC is a new periodic activation function for implicit neural representations that uses tanh(sin(x)) with explicit Lipschitz control parameter β, offering better gradient stability than SIREN while maintaining high-frequency preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing periodic activations like sine functions in INRs suffer from gradient instability and limited control over multi-scale behavior, despite their ability to preserve high-frequency information through oscillatory structure.

Method: Introduces HOSC activation: HOSC(x) = tanh(βsin(ω₀x)), which exposes explicit parameter β that controls the Lipschitz bound (βω₀). This provides direct mechanism to tune gradient magnitudes while retaining periodic carrier structure.

Result: Comprehensive empirical study across images, audio, video, NeRFs, and SDFs shows HOSC provides substantial benefits in some domains and competitive parity in others compared to SIREN, FINER, and related methods.

Conclusion: HOSC establishes as practical periodic activation for INR applications with domain-specific hyperparameter guidance, offering improved gradient stability while maintaining high-frequency information preservation.

Abstract: Periodic activations such as sine preserve high-frequency information in implicit neural representations (INRs) through their oscillatory structure, but often suffer from gradient instability and limited control over multi-scale behavior. We introduce the Hyperbolic Oscillator with Saturation Control (HOSC) activation, $\text{HOSC}(x) = \tanh\bigl(β\sin(ω_0 x)\bigr)$, which exposes an explicit parameter $β$ that controls the Lipschitz bound of the activation by $βω_0$. This provides a direct mechanism to tune gradient magnitudes while retaining a periodic carrier. We provide a mathematical analysis and conduct a comprehensive empirical study across images, audio, video, NeRFs, and SDFs using standardized training protocols. Comparative analysis against SIREN, FINER, and related methods shows where HOSC provides substantial benefits and where it achieves competitive parity. Results establish HOSC as a practical periodic activation for INR applications, with domain-specific guidance on hyperparameter selection.

### [187] [Multiplicative Orthogonal Sequential Editing for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07873)
*Hao-Xiang Xu,Jun-Yu Ma,Ziqi Peng,Yuhao Sun,Zhen-Hua Ling,Jia-Chen Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MOSE introduces a multiplicative orthogonal editing paradigm for LLMs that preserves numerical stability, achieving better sequential editing performance while maintaining general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current additive knowledge editing methods damage numerical stability indicators (condition number, norm), reducing editing performance and general abilities, especially in sequential editing scenarios. Existing improvements remain within the additive framework without fundamentally addressing this limitation.

Method: MOSE uses a multiplicative editing paradigm where new knowledge is incorporated into an orthogonal matrix, which is then multiplied by the original parameter matrix. This approach maintains numerical stability since multiplying by orthogonal matrices doesn't change key stability indicators.

Result: MOSE achieves 12.08% improvement in sequential editing performance while retaining 95.73% of general abilities across downstream tasks. It effectively limits deviations in edited parameter matrices and maintains numerical stability across three different LLMs.

Conclusion: The multiplicative orthogonal editing paradigm fundamentally addresses the numerical stability limitations of additive editing methods, providing better performance in sequential editing scenarios while preserving model capabilities.

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently modify the internal knowledge of large language models (LLMs) without compromising their other capabilities. The prevailing editing paradigm, which appends an update matrix to the original parameter matrix, has been shown by some studies to damage key numerical stability indicators (such as condition number and norm), thereby reducing editing performance and general abilities, especially in sequential editing scenario. Although subsequent methods have made some improvements, they remain within the additive framework and have not fundamentally addressed this limitation. To solve this problem, we analyze it from both statistical and mathematical perspectives and conclude that multiplying the original matrix by an orthogonal matrix does not change the numerical stability of the matrix. Inspired by this, different from the previous additive editing paradigm, a multiplicative editing paradigm termed Multiplicative Orthogonal Sequential Editing (MOSE) is proposed. Specifically, we first derive the matrix update in the multiplicative form, the new knowledge is then incorporated into an orthogonal matrix, which is multiplied by the original parameter matrix. In this way, the numerical stability of the edited matrix is unchanged, thereby maintaining editing performance and general abilities. We compared MOSE with several current knowledge editing methods, systematically evaluating their impact on both editing performance and the general abilities across three different LLMs. Experimental results show that MOSE effectively limits deviations in the edited parameter matrix and maintains its numerical stability. Compared to current methods, MOSE achieves a 12.08% improvement in sequential editing performance, while retaining 95.73% of general abilities across downstream tasks.

TL;DR: NOVAK is a modular gradient-based optimizer combining adaptive moment estimation, rectified learning rates, decoupled weight regularization, Nesterov momentum variants, and lookahead synchronization for superior performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing adaptive optimization methods, particularly their poor performance on deep plain networks without skip connections, by creating a unified framework that synergistically combines multiple optimization techniques.

Method: Dual-mode architecture with streamlined fast path; integrates adaptive moment estimation, rectified learning-rate scheduling, decoupled weight regularization, multiple Nesterov momentum variants, and memory-efficient lookahead synchronization; uses custom CUDA kernels for speed.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and ImageNette; outperforms 14 contemporary optimizers including Adam, AdamW, RAdam, Lion, and Adan; shows exceptional robustness, especially on VGG-16/ImageNette; 3-5x speedup for critical operations.

Conclusion: NOVAK's architectural contributions (rectification, decoupled decay, and hybrid momentum) are crucial for reliable training of deep plain networks, addressing a long-standing limitation of existing adaptive optimization methods.

Abstract: This work introduces NOVAK, a modular gradient-based optimization algorithm that integrates adaptive moment estimation, rectified learning-rate scheduling, decoupled weight regularization, multiple variants of Nesterov momentum, and lookahead synchronization into a unified, performance-oriented framework. NOVAK adopts a dual-mode architecture consisting of a streamlined fast path designed for production. The optimizer employs custom CUDA kernels that deliver substantial speedups (3-5 for critical operations) while preserving numerical stability under standard stochastic-optimization assumptions. We provide fully developed mathematical formulations for rectified adaptive learning rates, a memory-efficient lookahead mechanism that reduces overhead from O(2p) to O(p + p/k), and the synergistic coupling of complementary optimization components. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees and elucidates the stability and variance-reduction properties of the method. Extensive empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and ImageNette demonstrates NOVAK superiority over 14 contemporary optimizers, including Adam, AdamW, RAdam, Lion, and Adan. Across architectures such as ResNet-50, VGG-16, and ViT, NOVAK consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, and exceptional robustness, attaining very high accuracy on VGG-16/ImageNette demonstrating superior architectural robustness compared to contemporary optimizers. The results highlight that NOVAKs architectural contributions (particularly rectification, decoupled decay, and hybrid momentum) are crucial for reliable training of deep plain networks lacking skip connections, addressing a long-standing limitation of existing adaptive optimization methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current emotion recognition from EEG faces three main challenges: high inter-subject variability, limited labeled data, and lack of interpretable reasoning in existing approaches. While MLLMs have advanced emotion analysis, they haven't been adapted to handle the unique spatiotemporal characteristics of neural signals.

Method: E²-LLM integrates a pretrained EEG encoder with Qwen-based LLMs through learnable projection layers. It employs a multi-stage training pipeline: 1) emotion-discriminative pretraining, 2) cross-modal alignment, and 3) instruction tuning with chain-of-thought reasoning. The framework includes comprehensive evaluation covering basic emotion prediction, multi-task reasoning, and zero-shot scenario understanding.

Result: Experiments across seven emotion categories show E²-LLM achieves excellent emotion classification performance. Larger model variants demonstrate enhanced reliability and superior zero-shot generalization to complex reasoning scenarios. Model scaling improves both recognition accuracy and interpretable emotional understanding.

Conclusion: E²-LLM establishes a new paradigm combining physiological signals with LLM reasoning capabilities, showing that model scaling improves both recognition accuracy and interpretable emotional understanding in affective computing, addressing key limitations in current EEG-based emotion analysis.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains challenging due to high inter-subject variability, limited labeled data, and the lack of interpretable reasoning in existing approaches.

*Deyu Cao,Yixin Yin,Samin Aref*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A sliced Wasserstein loss function improves ultra-low-bit quantization by aligning output distributions between full-precision and quantized models, recovering significant accuracy losses without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have high economic and environmental costs due to resource inefficiency during deployment. Model quantization helps but compression below 4-bits often distorts activation distributions and degrades performance.

Method: Introduces a sliced Wasserstein loss function for distribution-aware calibration in ultra-low-bit post-training quantization. The loss aligns output distributions of full-precision and quantized models under random linear projections, complementing standard MSE loss without adding inference overhead.

Result: The proposed loss recovers 4.12-20.37% of OmniQuant's lost accuracy on LLaMA-2-7B, 0.93-7.65% on OPT-6.7B, and 2.26-6.20% on LLaMA-2-13B. TesseraQ's accuracy degradation is recovered by 3.63-7.63% when augmented with the proposed loss.

Conclusion: Distributional alignment provides a simple yet effective performance boost that can push the limits of frontier quantization methods, offering a practical solution for ultra-low-bit quantization without inference overhead.

Abstract: The benefits of most large language models come with steep and often hidden economic and environmental costs due to their resource usage inefficiency during deployment. Model quantization improves energy and memory efficiency through representing model parameters by lower-precision values. However, compression below 4-bits often distorts activation distributions and degrades performance. We address this challenge by introducing a sliced Wasserstein loss function for distribution-aware calibration in ultra-low-bit post-training quantization. The proposed loss aligns the output distributions of full-precision and quantized models under random linear projections, complementing standard mean-squared error loss without adding any computational overhead during inference. Our proposed loss function can be incorporated with any post-training quantization framework that has a retraining component. We demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed model by incorporating it with two frontier methods known as OmniQuant and TesseraQ. Compared to these two baselines, the proposed loss consistently improves both perplexity and downstream task accuracy across multiple ultra-low-bit settings. Our proposed loss function recovers 4.12-20.37% of the OmniQuant's lost accuracy on the language model LLaMA-2-7B, 0.93-7.65% on OPT-6.7B, and 2.26-6.20% on LLaMA-2-13B. TesseraQ's accuracy degradation is recovered by 3.63-7.63% in relative terms when augmented by our proposed loss function. Taken together, these results demonstrate that distributional alignment provides a simple yet effective performance boost that can push the limits of frontier quantization methods. Our method is available on GitHub to facilitate future progress in ultra-low-bit quantization.

*Hong Huang,Decheng Wu,Qiangqiang Hu,Guanghua Yu,Jinhai Yang,Jianchen Zhu,Xue Liu,Dapeng Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sherry is a hardware-efficient ternary quantization framework that introduces 3:4 fine-grained sparsity to achieve 1.25-bit width with power-of-two alignment, addressing the hardware misalignment of existing ternary quantization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM deployment on edge devices is hindered by high memory and computational requirements. Existing ternary quantization methods face a hardware misalignment problem - they must choose between 2-bit aligned packing (bit wastage) or 1.67-bit irregular packing (slow inference).

Method: Sherry introduces 3:4 fine-grained sparsity that packs blocks of four weights into five bits, achieving regularized 1.25-bit width with power-of-two alignment. It also addresses weight trapping in sparse ternary training with Arenas - an annealing residual synapse mechanism that maintains representational diversity.

Result: On LLaMA-3.2 across five benchmarks, Sherry matches state-of-the-art ternary performance while significantly reducing model size. On Intel i7-14700HX CPU, the 1B model achieves zero accuracy loss compared to SOTA baselines with 25% bit savings and 10% speedup.

Conclusion: Sherry resolves the hardware efficiency vs. performance trade-off in ternary quantization, enabling efficient LLM deployment on resource-constrained edge devices through hardware-aligned 1.25-bit quantization with maintained accuracy.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices is increasingly hindered by prohibitive memory and computational requirements. While ternary quantization offers a compelling solution by reducing weights to {-1, 0, +1}, current implementations suffer from a fundamental misalignment with commodity hardware. Most existing methods must choose between 2-bit aligned packing, which incurs significant bit wastage, or 1.67-bit irregular packing, which degrades inference speed. To resolve this tension, we propose Sherry, a hardware-efficient ternary quantization framework. Sherry introduces a 3:4 fine-grained sparsity that achieves a regularized 1.25-bit width by packing blocks of four weights into five bits, restoring power-of-two alignment. Furthermore, we identify weight trapping issue in sparse ternary training, which leads to representational collapse. To address this, Sherry introduces Arenas, an annealing residual synapse mechanism that maintains representational diversity during training. Empirical evaluations on LLaMA-3.2 across five benchmarks demonstrate that Sherry matches state-of-the-art ternary performance while significantly reducing model size. Notably, on an Intel i7-14700HX CPU, our 1B model achieves zero accuracy loss compared to SOTA baselines while providing 25% bit savings and 10% speed up.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDMs exhibit Attention Floating - dynamic, dispersed attention anchors that shift across denoising steps, unlike ARMs' fixed attention sinks. This enables shallow layers to build global structure and deep layers to focus on semantic content, explaining MDMs' superior in-context learning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked diffusion models are closing the performance gap with autoregressive models, but their internal attention mechanisms remain poorly understood. The paper aims to investigate attention behaviors in MDMs to understand their underlying mechanisms and performance advantages.

Method: The paper analyzes attention behaviors in masked diffusion models through empirical investigation, revealing the Attention Floating phenomenon. It examines how attention patterns evolve across denoising steps and layers, comparing them with autoregressive models' attention mechanisms.

Result: MDMs exhibit Attention Floating - dynamic, dispersed attention anchors that shift across denoising steps and layers, unlike ARMs' fixed attention sinks. This creates a Shallow Structure-Aware, Deep Content-Focused mechanism: shallow layers build global structure using floating tokens, while deeper layers focus on semantic content.

Conclusion: The distinctive Attention Floating pattern provides a mechanistic explanation for MDMs' strong in-context learning capabilities, allowing them to double performance compared to ARMs in knowledge-intensive tasks. This understanding helps explain why MDMs are narrowing the performance gap with ARMs.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs), which leverage bidirectional attention and a denoising process, are narrowing the performance gap with autoregressive models (ARMs). However, their internal attention mechanisms remain under-explored. This paper investigates the attention behaviors in MDMs, revealing the phenomenon of Attention Floating. Unlike ARMs, where attention converges to a fixed sink, MDMs exhibit dynamic, dispersed attention anchors that shift across denoising steps and layers. Further analysis reveals its Shallow Structure-Aware, Deep Content-Focused attention mechanism: shallow layers utilize floating tokens to build a global structural framework, while deeper layers allocate more capability toward capturing semantic content. Empirically, this distinctive attention pattern provides a mechanistic explanation for the strong in-context learning capabilities of MDMs, allowing them to double the performance compared to ARMs in knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently developed new advanced functionalities. Their effectiveness relies on statistical learning and generalization capabilities. However, they face limitations in internalizing the data they process and struggle, for instance, to autonomously execute algorithms.

TL;DR: LVICL: Vector-injected in-context learning for time series forecasting with frozen LLMs, improving performance without computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs for time series forecasting face dual challenges: performance gaps due to domain mismatch between pretraining corpora and time series data, and high computational overhead from fine-tuning. Need method to improve forecasting performance while keeping LLM parameters frozen.

Method: Proposes LVICL (vector-injected ICL) that uses learnable context vector adapter to extract compressed example information from multiple time series examples, then injects this vector into every layer of frozen LLM during forward pass to elicit in-context learning ability.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness. Approach improves forecasting performance without increasing prompt length (unlike conventional ICL) and suppresses harmful components through adaptive vector derivation.

Conclusion: LVICL successfully addresses dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead in LLM4TSF by enabling effective in-context learning with frozen LLM parameters through vector injection technique.

Abstract: The World Wide Web needs reliable predictive capabilities to respond to changes in user behavior and usage patterns. Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Bo Pan,Zhiping Zhang,Kevin Spiekermann,Tianchi Chen,Xiang Yu,Liying Zhang,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-stage transformer model for functional group replacement that generates removal and addition sequentially, ensuring substructure-level modifications and structural similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based methods for functional group replacement are limited in generating diverse novel compounds. Existing transformer approaches focus on single-step modeling without guaranteeing structural similarity.

Method: Developed a two-stage encoder-decoder transformer model using SMIRKS-based representations trained on matched molecular pairs (MMPs) from ChEMBL. Generates functional group removal and addition sequentially rather than one-shot generation.

Result: Method generates chemically valid transformations, explores diverse chemical spaces, and maintains scalability across varying search sizes. Outperforms traditional rule-based approaches.

Conclusion: The two-stage transformer approach advances functional group replacement by ensuring strict substructure-level modifications while enabling diverse chemical exploration and maintaining structural similarity.

Abstract: Functional group replacement is a pivotal approach in cheminformatics to enable the design of novel chemical compounds with tailored properties. Traditional methods for functional group removal and replacement often rely on rule-based heuristics, which can be limited in their ability to generate diverse and novel chemical structures. Recently, transformer-based models have shown promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of molecular transformations, but existing approaches typically focus on single-step modeling, lacking the guarantee of structural similarity. In this work, we seek to advance the state of the art by developing a novel two-stage transformer model for functional group removal and replacement. Unlike one-shot approaches that generate entire molecules in a single pass, our method generates the functional group to be removed and appended sequentially, ensuring strict substructure-level modifications. Using a matched molecular pairs (MMPs) dataset derived from ChEMBL, we trained an encoder-decoder transformer model with SMIRKS-based representations to capture transformation rules effectively. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our method's ability to generate chemically valid transformations, explore diverse chemical spaces, and maintain scalability across varying search sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting LLMs to specialized medical fields faces two key challenges: (1) Stability-Plasticity Dilemma - acquiring complex clinical knowledge without catastrophic forgetting of general world knowledge, and (2) Task Interference - disparate medical sub-tasks competing for limited low-rank parameter space.

Method: Integrates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) using asymmetric expert distribution (more experts in deeper layers for complex semantic abstractions) and a "Knowledge-Preservation Plugin" inspired by LoRA MoE to isolate general-purpose reasoning. Employs soft merging with adaptive routing and rank-wise decoupling.

Result: Consistently outperforms standard LoRA and conventional MoE architectures across multiple clinical NLP tasks while retaining the model's general cognitive capabilities.

Conclusion: Med-MoE-LoRA provides an effective solution for efficient multi-task domain adaptation in medical scenarios, addressing key challenges in specialized LLM adaptation while maintaining general reasoning abilities.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted focus from general-purpose capabilities to domain-specific expertise. However, adapting LLMs to specialized fields such as medicine presents two challenge: (1) the "Stability-Plasticity Dilemma", where the model must acquire complex clinical knowledge without suffering from catastrophic forgetting of general world knowledge; and (2) "Task Interference", where disparate sub-tasks, such as medical diagnosis, report summarization, and drug-drug interaction prediction, compete for limited low-rank parameter space. In this paper, we propose Med-MoE-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient multi-task domain adaptation, especially for medical scenarios. Drawing inspiration from recent advances, our framework employs an asymmetric expert distribution where deeper layers are equipped with a higher density of LoRA experts to capture complex semantic abstractions. We further introduce a "Knowledge-Preservation Plugin", inspired by LoRA MoE, to isolate and protect general-purpose reasoning. By utilizing soft merging with adaptive routing and rank-wise decoupling, Med-MoE-LoRA achieves superior performance in medical benchmarks while reducing interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms standard LoRA and conventional MoE architectures across multiple clinical NLP tasks while retaining the model's general cognitive capabilities.

### [199] [Coupled Diffusion-Encoder Models for Reconstruction of Flow Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07946)
*AmirPouya Hemmasian,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiffCoder combines a convolutional encoder with a diffusion model to reconstruct flow fields, outperforming VAEs in preserving statistical properties under strong compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autoencoders like VAEs struggle to preserve higher-order statistical structure of fluid flows when compressed aggressively. There's a need for methods that maintain statistical properties beyond just minimizing pointwise reconstruction error.

Method: DiffCoder integrates a probabilistic diffusion model with a conventional convolutional ResNet encoder trained end-to-end. The encoder compresses flow fields into latent representations, while the diffusion model learns a generative prior for reconstructions conditioned on the compressed state.

Result: Under aggressive compression, DiffCoder significantly improves spectral accuracy while VAEs degrade substantially. Both show comparable L2 error, but DiffCoder better preserves distributional structure. At moderate compression, large VAEs remain competitive.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based priors provide greatest benefit when information bottlenecks are severe, offering a promising approach for compact, statistically consistent representations of complex flow fields.

Abstract: Data-driven flow-field reconstruction typically relies on autoencoder architectures that compress high-dimensional states into low-dimensional latent representations. However, classical approaches such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) often struggle to preserve the higher-order statistical structure of fluid flows when subjected to strong compression. We propose DiffCoder, a coupled framework that integrates a probabilistic diffusion model with a conventional convolutional ResNet encoder and trains both components end-to-end. The encoder compresses the flow field into a latent representation, while the diffusion model learns a generative prior over reconstructions conditioned on the compressed state. This design allows DiffCoder to recover distributional and spectral properties that are not strictly required for minimizing pointwise reconstruction loss but are critical for faithfully representing statistical properties of the flow field. We evaluate DiffCoder and VAE baselines across multiple model sizes and compression ratios on a challenging dataset of Kolmogorov flow fields. Under aggressive compression, DiffCoder significantly improves the spectral accuracy while VAEs exhibit substantial degradation. Although both methods show comparable relative L2 reconstruction error, DiffCoder better preserves the underlying distributional structure of the flow. At moderate compression levels, sufficiently large VAEs remain competitive, suggesting that diffusion-based priors provide the greatest benefit when information bottlenecks are severe. These results demonstrate that the generative decoding by diffusion offers a promising path toward compact, statistically consistent representations of complex flow fields.

*Yannick Molinghen,Augustin Delecluse,Renaud De Landtsheer,Stefano Michelini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-based neighborhood selection strategies for local search metaheuristics were evaluated across three combinatorial optimization problems, showing ε-greedy consistently performs well while deep RL methods require careful reward design and longer runtime to be competitive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While reinforcement learning has been applied to combinatorial optimization, its effectiveness specifically within local search metaheuristics remains underexamined, prompting this evaluation of various RL approaches for neighborhood selection.

Method: Evaluated multiple RL-based neighborhood selection strategies including multi-armed bandits (upper confidence bound, ε-greedy) and deep RL methods (proximal policy optimization, double deep Q-network), comparing them against baselines across three problems: traveling salesman, pickup and delivery with time windows, and car sequencing.

Result: Performance varied substantially across problems, with ε-greedy consistently ranking among best performers. Deep RL approaches required careful reward function design to handle large cost variations from constraint violations, and their computational overhead only made them competitive with substantially longer runtime.

Conclusion: The study highlights both the promise and practical limitations of deep reinforcement learning in local search, showing that simpler methods like ε-greedy can be highly effective while deep RL requires careful implementation and longer computation time to be competitive.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently gained traction as a means to improve combinatorial optimization methods, yet its effectiveness within local search metaheuristics specifically remains comparatively underexamined. In this study, we evaluate a range of reinforcement learning-based neighborhood selection strategies -- multi-armed bandits (upper confidence bound, $ε$-greedy) and deep reinforcement learning methods (proximal policy optimization, double deep $Q$-network) -- and compare them against multiple baselines across three different problems: the traveling salesman problem, the pickup and delivery problem with time windows, and the car sequencing problem. We show how search-specific characteristics, particularly large variations in cost due to constraint violation penalties, necessitate carefully designed reward functions to provide stable and informative learning signals. Our extensive experiments reveal that algorithm performance varies substantially across problems, although that $ε$-greedy consistently ranks among the best performers. In contrast, the computational overhead of deep reinforcement learning approaches only makes them competitive with a substantially longer runtime. These findings highlight both the promise and the practical limitations of deep reinforcement learning in local search.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Bayesian optimization with Bayesian neural networks suffers from expensive posterior sampling and acquisition function optimization bottlenecks, limiting scalability for expensive black-box function optimization tasks.

Method: Proposes VBO-MI using variational mutual information estimation with actor-critic architecture: action-net navigates input space and variational critic estimates information gain, enabling end-to-end gradient flow and eliminating inner-loop acquisition optimization.

Result: Achieves up to 100x reduction in FLOPs compared to BNN-BO baselines while maintaining or improving optimization performance across high-dimensional synthetic functions, PDE optimization, Lunar Lander control, and categorical Pest Control tasks.

Conclusion: VBO-MI provides a computationally scalable Bayesian optimization framework that eliminates traditional bottlenecks through gradient-based variational mutual information estimation, enabling efficient optimization of expensive black-box functions.

Abstract: Many real-world tasks require optimizing expensive black-box functions accessible only through noisy evaluations, a setting commonly addressed with Bayesian optimization (BO). While Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have recently emerged as scalable alternatives to Gaussian Processes (GPs), traditional BNN-BO frameworks remain burdened by expensive posterior sampling and acquisition function optimization. In this work, we propose {VBO-MI} (Variational Bayesian Optimization with Mutual Information), a fully gradient-based BO framework that leverages recent advances in variational mutual information estimation. To enable end-to-end gradient flow, we employ an actor-critic architecture consisting of an {action-net} to navigate the input space and a {variational critic} to estimate information gain. This formulation effectively eliminates the traditional inner-loop acquisition optimization bottleneck, achieving up to a {$10^2 \times$ reduction in FLOPs} compared to BNN-BO baselines. We evaluate our method on a diverse suite of benchmarks, including high-dimensional synthetic functions and complex real-world tasks such as PDE optimization, the Lunar Lander control problem, and categorical Pest Control. Our experiments demonstrate that VBO-MI consistently provides the same or superior optimization performance and computational scalability over the baselines.

### [202] [Hybrid SARIMA LSTM Model for Local Weather Forecasting: A Residual Learning Approach for Data Driven Meteorological Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07951)
*Shreyas Rajeev,Karthik Mudenahalli Ashoka,Amit Mallappa Tiparaddi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid SARIMA-LSTM model combines statistical seasonal forecasting with deep learning to improve long-term temperature prediction by separating predictable climate trends from nonlinear weather fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SARIMA models fail to capture nonlinear atmospheric volatility, while LSTM networks suffer from error propagation in open-loop forecasting. Temperature data combines deterministic seasonal patterns with stochastic short-term fluctuations, requiring a hybrid approach.

Method: Residual-learning strategy: SARIMA models long-term seasonal trends, LSTM trained exclusively on SARIMA residuals (nonlinear errors). Fusion of statistical stability (SARIMA) with neural plasticity (LSTM) to minimize error propagation.

Result: The hybrid architecture minimizes systematic residual errors, reduces under-prediction of sudden spikes and over-smoothing of declines, and enhances long-horizon forecasting accuracy compared to standalone models.

Conclusion: Combining SARIMA's seasonal modeling strength with LSTM's nonlinear pattern recognition creates a superior framework for atmospheric temperature forecasting that addresses limitations of both individual approaches.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting long-term atmospheric variables remains a defining challenge in meteorological science due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. Temperature data represents a complex superposition of deterministic cyclical climate forces and stochastic, short-term fluctuations. While planetary mechanics drive predictable seasonal periodicities, rapid meteorological changes such as thermal variations, pressure anomalies, and humidity shifts introduce nonlinear volatilities that defy simple extrapolation. Historically, the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model has been the standard for modeling historical weather data, prized for capturing linear seasonal trends. However, SARIMA operates under strict assumptions of stationarity, failing to capture abrupt, nonlinear transitions. This leads to systematic residual errors, manifesting as the under-prediction of sudden spikes or the over-smoothing of declines. Conversely, Deep Learning paradigms, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrate exceptional efficacy in handling intricate time-series data. By utilizing memory gates, LSTMs learn complex nonlinear dependencies. Yet, LSTMs face instability in open-loop forecasting; without ground truth feedback, minor deviations compound recursively, causing divergence. To resolve these limitations, we propose a Hybrid SARIMA-LSTM architecture. This framework employs a residual-learning strategy to decompose temperature into a predictable climate component and a nonlinear weather component. The SARIMA unit models the robust, long-term seasonal trend, while the LSTM is trained exclusively on the residuals the nonlinear errors SARIMA fails to capture. By fusing statistical stability with neural plasticity, this hybrid approach minimizes error propagation and enhances long-horizon accuracy.

*Nairui Liu,Fang He,Xindi Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-based model for predicting future-port ETA using historical sailing data, port congestion proxies, and vessel descriptors, outperforming baselines on global maritime data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional ETA models only work for immediate next ports and require real-time AIS data, which is unavailable for future voyage segments. There's a need for accurate segment-level sailing duration forecasts to improve maritime schedule reliability and port operations.

Method: Reformulates future-port ETA prediction as segment-level time-series forecasting. Uses transformer architecture with causally masked attention for long-range temporal dependencies, integrating historical sailing durations, destination port congestion proxies, and static vessel descriptors. Employs multi-task learning to jointly predict segment sailing durations and port congestion states.

Result: Model consistently outperforms competitive baselines on real-world global dataset from 2021. Shows 4.85% relative reduction in MAE and 4.95% in MAPE compared to sequence baseline models, and 9.39% MAE reduction and 52.97% MAPE reduction compared to gradient boosting machines. Case studies confirm superior accuracy for major destination ports.

Conclusion: The proposed transformer-based framework effectively addresses the limitation of conventional ETA models by enabling accurate future-port predictions without real-time AIS data, demonstrating significant improvements in forecasting accuracy for maritime operations.

Abstract: Accurate forecasts of segment-level sailing durations are fundamental to enhancing maritime schedule reliability and optimizing long-term port operations. However, conventional estimated time of arrival (ETA) models are primarily designed for the immediate next port of call and rely heavily on real-time automatic identification system (AIS) data, which is inherently unavailable for future voyage segments. To address this gap, the study reformulates future-port ETA prediction as a segment-level time-series forecasting problem. We develop a transformer-based architecture that integrates historical sailing durations, destination port congestion proxies, and static vessel descriptors. The proposed framework employs a causally masked attention mechanism to capture long-range temporal dependencies and a multi-task learning head to jointly predict segment sailing durations and port congestion states, leveraging shared latent signals to mitigate high uncertainty. Evaluation on a real-world global dataset from 2021 demonstrates the proposed model consistently outperforms a comprehensive suite of competitive baselines. The result shows a relative reduction of 4.85% in mean absolute error (MAE) and 4.95% in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared with sequence baseline models. The relative reductions with gradient boosting machines are 9.39% in MAE and 52.97% in MAPE. Case studies for the major destination port further illustrate the model's superior accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfGraND is a knowledge distillation framework that transfers knowledge from GNNs to MLPs by prioritizing structurally influential nodes and pre-computing multi-hop neighborhood features to make MLPs graph-aware without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs face latency challenges for inference tasks, while MLPs are computationally efficient but perform poorly when trained directly. Existing KD methods overlook structural importance of nodes in graphs, treating all nodes uniformly or using graph-agnostic metrics.

Method: InfGraND identifies structurally influential nodes to guide distillation, prioritizing critical parts of the graph. It embeds structural awareness in MLPs through one-time multi-hop neighborhood feature pre-computation, enriching MLP input without inference-time overhead.

Result: InfGraND consistently outperforms prior GNN-to-MLP KD methods across seven homophilic graph benchmark datasets in both transductive and inductive settings, demonstrating practical benefits for latency-critical applications.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the performance gap between GNNs and MLPs by focusing on structural importance of nodes and enabling efficient, graph-aware MLPs suitable for real-world latency-critical applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the go-to model for graph data analysis. However, GNNs rely on two key operations - aggregation and update, which can pose challenges for low-latency inference tasks or resource-constrained scenarios. Simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) offer a computationally efficient alternative. Yet, training an MLP in a supervised setting often leads to suboptimal performance. Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a GNN teacher to an MLP student has emerged to bridge this gap. However, most KD methods either transfer knowledge uniformly across all nodes or rely on graph-agnostic indicators such as prediction uncertainty. We argue this overlooks a more fundamental, graph-centric inquiry: "How important is a node to the structure of the graph?" We introduce a framework, InfGraND, an Influence-guided Graph KNowledge Distillation from GNN to MLP that addresses this by identifying and prioritizing structurally influential nodes to guide the distillation process, ensuring that the MLP learns from the most critical parts of the graph. Additionally, InfGraND embeds structural awareness in MLPs through one-time multi-hop neighborhood feature pre-computation, which enriches the student MLP's input and thus avoids inference-time overhead. Our rigorous evaluation in transductive and inductive settings across seven homophilic graph benchmark datasets shows InfGraND consistently outperforms prior GNN to MLP KD methods, demonstrating its practicality for numerous latency-critical applications in real-world settings.

*Shaocong Ma,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses Riemannian zeroth-order optimization on geodesically incomplete manifolds by constructing structure-preserving complete metrics and analyzing convergence of intrinsic stochastic gradient descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many Riemannian optimization problems occur on manifolds with incomplete metrics, making standard convergence analyses inapplicable. The paper aims to develop optimization methods that work reliably even when the underlying metric is geodesically incomplete.

Method: Construct structure-preserving geodesically complete metrics that preserve stationary points. Revisit symmetric two-point zeroth-order estimator with intrinsic analysis based only on manifold geometry. Establish convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent using this intrinsic estimator.

Result: Under suitable conditions, ε-stationary points under the constructed complete metric correspond to ε-stationary points under the original incomplete metric, matching best-known complexity in complete settings. Empirical studies on synthetic problems and mesh optimization confirm theoretical findings and stable convergence.

Conclusion: The framework enables reliable Riemannian zeroth-order optimization on geodesically incomplete manifolds by constructing structure-preserving complete metrics and using intrinsic analysis, maintaining convergence guarantees comparable to complete settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we study Riemannian zeroth-order optimization in settings where the underlying Riemannian metric $g$ is geodesically incomplete, and the goal is to approximate stationary points with respect to this incomplete metric. To address this challenge, we construct structure-preserving metrics that are geodesically complete while ensuring that every stationary point under the new metric remains stationary under the original one. Building on this foundation, we revisit the classical symmetric two-point zeroth-order estimator and analyze its mean-squared error from a purely intrinsic perspective, depending only on the manifold's geometry rather than any ambient embedding. Leveraging this intrinsic analysis, we establish convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent with this intrinsic estimator. Under additional suitable conditions, an $ε$-stationary point under the constructed metric $g'$ also corresponds to an $ε$-stationary point under the original metric $g$, thereby matching the best-known complexity in the geodesically complete setting. Empirical studies on synthetic problems confirm our theoretical findings, and experiments on a practical mesh optimization task demonstrate that our framework maintains stable convergence even in the absence of geodesic completeness.

TL;DR: LUT-compiled KANs enable real-time DoS detection on resource-constrained IoT devices with 68-5000× speedup and minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DoS attacks threaten IoT ecosystems, but deploying intrusion detection on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging. KANs offer compact alternatives to MLPs but have computational overhead from B-spline evaluation unsuitable for latency-critical IoT applications.

Method: Propose a lookup table (LUT) compilation pipeline that replaces expensive spline computations with precomputed quantized tables and linear interpolation. Use lightweight KAN model (50K parameters, 0.19MB) and evaluate across LUT resolutions, quantization schemes, and out-of-bounds policies.

Conclusion: LUT-compiled KANs enable real-time DoS detection on CPU-only IoT gateways with deterministic inference latency and minimal resource footprint, establishing clear Pareto frontiers for accuracy-latency-memory trade-offs.

Abstract: Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks pose a critical threat to Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems, yet deploying effective intrusion detection on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a compact alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by placing learnable univariate spline functions on edges rather than fixed activations on nodes, achieving competitive accuracy with fewer parameters. However, runtime B-spline evaluation introduces significant computational overhead unsuitable for latency-critical IoT applications. We propose a lookup table (LUT) compilation pipeline that replaces expensive spline computations with precomputed quantized tables and linear interpolation, dramatically reducing inference latency while preserving detection quality. Our lightweight KAN model (50K parameters, 0.19~MB) achieves 99.0\% accuracy on the CICIDS2017 DoS dataset. After LUT compilation with resolution $L=8$, the model maintains 98.96\% accuracy (F1 degradation $<0.0004$) while achieving $\mathbf{68\times}$ speedup at batch size 256 and over $\mathbf{5000\times}$ speedup at batch size 1, with only $2\times$ memory overhead. We provide comprehensive evaluation across LUT resolutions, quantization schemes, and out-of-bounds policies, establishing clear Pareto frontiers for accuracy-latency-memory trade-offs. Our results demonstrate that LUT-compiled KANs enable real-time DoS detection on CPU-only IoT gateways with deterministic inference latency and minimal resource footprint.

TL;DR: Q-realign is a post-hoc defense method using post-training quantization to recover safety alignment in fine-tuned LLMs without retraining, achieving safety restoration with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task-specific fine-tuning of safety-aligned LLMs often erodes safety alignment, creating deployment risks. Existing defenses require complex training integration, high computational costs, and disrupt deployment workflows.

Method: Q-realign reframes quantization as a dual-objective procedure for both compression and safety recovery. It analyzes representational structure and uses post-training quantization to decouple safety alignment from fine-tuning, naturally integrating into existing deployment pipelines.

Result: The method substantially reduces unsafe behaviors while preserving task performance across multiple models and datasets. It achieves significant reductions in memory usage and GPU hours, recovering safety alignment of a fine-tuned 7B LLM on a single RTX 4090 within 40 minutes.

Conclusion: Q-realign provides a practical, turnkey solution for safety-aware deployment that decouples safety recovery from training, reduces computational overhead, and integrates seamlessly into modern deployment workflows.

Abstract: Public large language models (LLMs) are typically safety-aligned during pretraining, yet task-specific fine-tuning required for deployment often erodes this alignment and introduces safety risks. Existing defenses either embed safety recovery into fine-tuning or rely on fine-tuning-derived priors for post-hoc correction, leaving safety recovery tightly coupled with training and incurring high computational overhead and a complex workflow. To address these challenges, we propose \texttt{Q-realign}, a post-hoc defense method based on post-training quantization, guided by an analysis of representational structure. By reframing quantization as a dual-objective procedure for compression and safety, \texttt{Q-realign} decouples safety alignment from fine-tuning and naturally piggybacks into modern deployment pipelines. Experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that our method substantially reduces unsafe behaviors while preserving task performance, with significant reductions in memory usage and GPU hours. Notably, our approach can recover the safety alignment of a fine-tuned 7B LLM on a single RTX 4090 within 40 minutes. Overall, our work provides a practical, turnkey solution for safety-aware deployment.

*Zheng Zhou,Isabella McEvoy,Camilo E. Valderrama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dual-branch transformer framework fuses local channel-wise and global trial-level EEG features with attention-based fusion and domain-adversarial regularization to improve subject-independent emotion recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subject-independent EEG emotion recognition faces challenges from inter-subject variability and difficulty learning robust representations from short, noisy recordings. Existing methods often fail to effectively combine local channel-specific information with global trial-level characteristics.

Method: Proposes a fusion framework integrating: (1) local channel-wise descriptors (differential entropy + graph-theoretic features per channel), and (2) global trial-level descriptors (time-domain, spectral, and complexity features). These are fused in a dual-branch transformer with attention-based fusion and domain-adversarial regularization, with intensity threshold filtering.

Result: Outperforms single-view and classical baselines under leave-one-subject-out protocol on SEED-VII dataset, achieving ~40% mean accuracy in 7-class subject-independent emotion recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed local-global fusion framework effectively addresses inter-subject variability in EEG emotion recognition by combining complementary representations, demonstrating improved cross-subject generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Subject-independent EEG emotion recognition is challenged by pronounced inter-subject variability and the difficulty of learning robust representations from short, noisy recordings. To address this, we propose a fusion framework that integrates (i) local, channel-wise descriptors and (ii) global, trial-level descriptors, improving cross-subject generalization on the SEED-VII dataset. Local representations are formed per channel by concatenating differential entropy with graph-theoretic features, while global representations summarize time-domain, spectral, and complexity characteristics at the trial level. These representations are fused in a dual-branch transformer with attention-based fusion and domain-adversarial regularization, with samples filtered by an intensity threshold. Experiments under a leave-one-subject-out protocol demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms single-view and classical baselines, achieving approximately 40% mean accuracy in 7-class subject-independent emotion recognition.

TL;DR: STO-RL is an offline RL framework that uses LLMs to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and applies potential-based reward shaping to solve long-horizon sparse-reward tasks efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL struggles with long-horizon sparse-reward tasks. Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical methods overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies.

Method: Leverages LLMs to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals. Uses augmented dataset with shaped rewards for offline policy training.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks. Achieves faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Robust to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences.

Conclusion: LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets, avoiding costly and risky online interactions, but it often struggles with long-horizon tasks involving sparse rewards. Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL.

*Kenneth Gee,Sai Ravela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 10-term cubic stochastic differential equation model for tropical cyclone intensification is learned from data using automated system identification, capturing historical intensification statistics and hazard estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tropical cyclone hazard quantification is challenging due to limited historical data. While physics-based and statistical/ML models exist, it's unclear if a physically reasonable, simple physics-style differential equation model can be learned from data.

Method: Develop a 10-term cubic stochastic differential equation model trained on hurricane intensity data (IBTrACS) with environmental features from ERA5 reanalysis. Uses automated system identification techniques to learn the model from Northern Hemisphere data.

Result: The model generates synthetic intensity series that capture many aspects of historical intensification statistics and hazard estimates in the Northern Hemisphere.

Conclusion: Interpretable, physics-style models of complex earth system dynamics can be learned using automated system identification techniques, showing promise for data-driven physics modeling.

Abstract: Tropical cyclones are dangerous natural hazards, but their hazard is challenging to quantify directly from historical datasets due to limited dataset size and quality. Models of cyclone intensification fill this data gap by simulating huge ensembles of synthetic hurricanes based on estimates of the storm's large scale environment. Both physics-based and statistical/ML intensification models have been developed to tackle this problem, but an open question is: can a physically reasonable and simple physics-style differential equation model of intensification be learned from data? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by presenting a 10-term cubic stochastic differential equation model of Tropical Cyclone intensification. The model depends on a well-vetted suite of engineered environmental features known to drive intensification and is trained using a high quality dataset of hurricane intensity (IBTrACS) with estimates of the cyclone's large scale environment from a data-assimilated simulation (ERA5 reanalysis), restricted to the Northern Hemisphere. The model generates synthetic intensity series which capture many aspects of historical intensification statistics and hazard estimates in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results show promise that interpretable, physics style models of complex earth system dynamics can be learned using automated system identification techniques.

*Tianyue Zhou,Jung-Hoon Cho,Cathy Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SD-MBTL is a framework that dynamically detects the generalization structure of Contextual MDPs and selects appropriate multi-policy transfer learning algorithms, outperforming prior methods by 12.49%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches to Contextual RL (independent training and multi-task learning) have limitations: excessive computational costs or negative transfer. While MBTL shows promise, different CMDPs have varying structural properties requiring different task selection strategies.

Method: Proposes Structure Detection MBTL (SD-MBTL) framework that dynamically identifies underlying generalization structure of CMDPs and selects appropriate MBTL algorithm. Specifically introduces M/GP-MBTL which detects Mountain structure (where performance degrades with context difference) and adaptively switches between Gaussian Process-based and clustering-based approaches.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic data and CRL benchmarks (continuous control, traffic control, agricultural management) show M/GP-MBTL surpasses strongest prior method by 12.49% on aggregated metric.

Conclusion: Online structure detection is promising for guiding source task selection in complex CRL environments, enabling adaptive algorithm selection based on detected CMDP structure.

Abstract: Contextual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) tackles the problem of solving a set of related Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) that vary across different context variables. Traditional approaches--independent training and multi-task learning--struggle with either excessive computational costs or negative transfer. A recently proposed multi-policy approach, Model-Based Transfer Learning (MBTL), has demonstrated effectiveness by strategically selecting a few tasks to train and zero-shot transfer. However, CMDPs encompass a wide range of problems, exhibiting structural properties that vary from problem to problem. As such, different task selection strategies are suitable for different CMDPs. In this work, we introduce Structure Detection MBTL (SD-MBTL), a generic framework that dynamically identifies the underlying generalization structure of CMDP and selects an appropriate MBTL algorithm. For instance, we observe Mountain structure in which generalization performance degrades from the training performance of the target task as the context difference increases. We thus propose M/GP-MBTL, which detects the structure and adaptively switches between a Gaussian Process-based approach and a clustering-based approach. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and CRL benchmarks--covering continuous control, traffic control, and agricultural management--show that M/GP-MBTL surpasses the strongest prior method by 12.49% on the aggregated metric. These results highlight the promise of online structure detection for guiding source task selection in complex CRL environments.

### [213] [Intra-tree Column Subsampling Hinders XGBoost Learning of Ratio-like Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08121)
*Mykola Pinchuk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Intra-tree column subsampling in XGBoost harms performance when models need to synthesize ratio-like features from primitive measurements, but including engineered ratio features mitigates this effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world problems require combining multiple raw measurements (like ratios or rates) to reveal meaningful signals. Gradient boosted trees must synthesize these combinations through coordinated splits, and the paper investigates whether intra-tree column subsampling makes this synthesis harder.

Method: Used two synthetic data generating processes with cancellation-style structure where two primitive features share a strong nuisance factor while the target depends on a smaller differential factor. Varied colsample_bylevel and colsample_bynode parameters (s in {0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9}) in XGBoost. Compared primitives-only setting vs. control feature set that includes engineered ratio features. Used path-based co-usage metric to analyze feature coordination.

Result: Intra-tree column subsampling reduces test PR-AUC in primitives-only settings, with relative decrease reaching 54% when both parameters are 0.4. The effect largely disappears when engineered ratio features are included. Path-based co-usage metric drops in the same cells where performance deteriorates.

Conclusion: If ratio-like structure is plausible in your data, either avoid intra-tree column subsampling or include the intended ratio features as engineered features to preserve model performance.

Abstract: Many applied problems contain signal that becomes clear only after combining multiple raw measurements. Ratios and rates are common examples. In gradient boosted trees, this combination is not an explicit operation: the model must synthesize it through coordinated splits on the component features. We study whether intra-tree column subsampling in XGBoost makes that synthesis harder. We use two synthetic data generating processes with cancellation-style structure. In both, two primitive features share a strong nuisance factor, while the target depends on a smaller differential factor. A log ratio cancels the nuisance and isolates the signal. We vary colsample_bylevel and colsample_bynode over s in {0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9}, emphasizing mild subsampling (s >= 0.8). A control feature set includes the engineered ratio, removing the need for synthesis. Across both processes, intra-tree column subsampling reduces test PR-AUC in the primitives-only setting. In the main process the relative decrease reaches 54 percent when both parameters are set to 0.4. The effect largely disappears when the engineered ratio is present. A path-based co-usage metric drops in the same cells where performance deteriorates. Practically, if ratio-like structure is plausible, either avoid intra-tree subsampling or include the intended ratio features.

*Atefeh Termehchi,Ekram Hossain,Isaac Woungang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to analyze interpretability and out-of-domain generalization for recurrent neural networks using Koopman operator theory and spectral analysis, then develops a domain generalization approach to improve robustness to distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often lack interpretability and generalization, especially for safety-critical applications. Current theoretical analyses are incomplete, particularly for sequential data with temporal correlations where independent sample assumptions are violated. There's a need to better understand and improve RNNs' interpretability and robustness to domain shifts.

Method: Models trained RNN states as unknown nonlinear closed-loop feedback systems, approximates the nonlinear dynamics with linear operators using Koopman operator theory for interpretability, then uses spectral analysis to quantify worst-case domain shift impact on generalization error. Builds on this analysis to propose a domain generalization method.

Result: Develops a theoretical framework for analyzing RNN interpretability and OOD generalization, proposes a domain generalization method that reduces OOD generalization error and improves robustness to distribution shifts, and validates the approach on practical temporal pattern-learning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed Koopman operator-based analysis provides interpretability for RNNs and enables quantification of generalization errors under domain shifts, leading to a practical domain generalization method that enhances RNN robustness for temporal pattern learning tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has driven broad advances across scientific and engineering domains. Despite its success, DL models often exhibit limited interpretability and generalization, which can undermine trust, especially in safety-critical deployments. As a result, there is growing interest in (i) analyzing interpretability and generalization and (ii) developing models that perform robustly under data distributions different from those seen during training (i.e. domain generalization). However, the theoretical analysis of DL remains incomplete. For example, many generalization analyses assume independent samples, which is violated in sequential data with temporal correlations. Motivated by these limitations, this paper proposes a method to analyze interpretability and out-of-domain (OOD) generalization for a family of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Specifically, the evolution of a trained RNN's states is modeled as an unknown, discrete-time, nonlinear closed-loop feedback system. Using Koopman operator theory, these nonlinear dynamics are approximated with a linear operator, enabling interpretability. Spectral analysis is then used to quantify the worst-case impact of domain shifts on the generalization error. Building on this analysis, a domain generalization method is proposed that reduces the OOD generalization error and improves the robustness to distribution shifts. Finally, the proposed analysis and domain generalization approach are validated on practical temporal pattern-learning tasks.

*Zeyang Li,Sunbochen Tang,Navid Azizan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified framework called Reverse Flow Matching (RFM) that trains diffusion/flow policies in online RL without direct target samples, combining noise-expectation and gradient-expectation methods into a single variance-reduced estimator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion and flow policies are powerful for online RL but hard to train efficiently due to lack of direct samples from the target Boltzmann distribution defined by Q-functions. Existing methods (noise-expectation and gradient-expectation) seem distinct without clear formal relationship.

Method: Propose Reverse Flow Matching (RFM) framework using reverse inferential perspective: formulate training as posterior mean estimation given noisy samples. Use Langevin Stein operators to construct zero-mean control variates, creating a general class of variance-reduced estimators that combine Q-value and Q-gradient information.

Result: Shows existing noise-expectation and gradient-expectation methods are specific instances of RFM. Enables training flow policies (not just diffusion) for Boltzmann distributions. Derives optimal minimum-variance estimator combining Q-value and Q-gradient info. Demonstrates improved performance on continuous-control benchmarks compared to diffusion policy baselines.

Conclusion: RFM provides unified theoretical framework for training diffusion/flow policies in online RL, enabling more efficient and stable training by combining information from both Q-values and Q-gradients through principled variance reduction techniques.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow policies are gaining prominence in online reinforcement learning (RL) due to their expressive power, yet training them efficiently remains a critical challenge. A fundamental difficulty in online RL is the lack of direct samples from the target distribution; instead, the target is an unnormalized Boltzmann distribution defined by the Q-function. To address this, two seemingly distinct families of methods have been proposed for diffusion policies: a noise-expectation family, which utilizes a weighted average of noise as the training target, and a gradient-expectation family, which employs a weighted average of Q-function gradients. Yet, it remains unclear how these objectives relate formally or if they can be synthesized into a more general formulation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, reverse flow matching (RFM), which rigorously addresses the problem of training diffusion and flow models without direct target samples. By adopting a reverse inferential perspective, we formulate the training target as a posterior mean estimation problem given an intermediate noisy sample. Crucially, we introduce Langevin Stein operators to construct zero-mean control variates, deriving a general class of estimators that effectively reduce importance sampling variance. We show that existing noise-expectation and gradient-expectation methods are two specific instances within this broader class. This unified view yields two key advancements: it extends the capability of targeting Boltzmann distributions from diffusion to flow policies, and enables the principled combination of Q-value and Q-gradient information to derive an optimal, minimum-variance estimator, thereby improving training efficiency and stability. We instantiate RFM to train a flow policy in online RL, and demonstrate improved performance on continuous-control benchmarks compared to diffusion policy baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static graph construction methods based on Euclidean distance fail to capture intrinsic curvature of data manifolds. Existing Ollivier-Ricci Curvature Flow (OCF) has prohibitive computational complexity due to reliance on Optimal Transport/Wasserstein distance, limiting its application to large-scale datasets and deep learning frameworks.

Method: Introduces Resistance Curvature Flow (RCF) framework leveraging effective resistance from circuit physics to transform expensive curvature optimization into efficient matrix operations. Proposes DGSL-RCF algorithm for graph optimization based on this framework.

Result: RCF achieves over 100x computational acceleration while maintaining geometric optimization capabilities comparable to OCF. Experimental results across deep metric learning, manifold learning, and graph structure learning demonstrate that DGSL-RCF significantly improves representation quality and downstream task performance.

Conclusion: RCF provides an efficient geometric evolution framework that overcomes computational bottlenecks of traditional curvature flow methods, enabling practical application in large-scale datasets and deep learning while effectively capturing intrinsic manifold curvature and improving representation learning.

Abstract: Geometric Representation Learning (GRL) aims to approximate the non-Euclidean topology of high-dimensional data through discrete graph structures, grounded in the manifold hypothesis. However, traditional static graph construction methods based on Euclidean distance often fail to capture the intrinsic curvature characteristics of the data manifold. Although Ollivier-Ricci Curvature Flow (OCF) has proven to be a powerful tool for dynamic topological optimization, its core reliance on Optimal Transport (Wasserstein distance) leads to prohibitive computational complexity, severely limiting its application in large-scale datasets and deep learning frameworks. To break this bottleneck, this paper proposes a novel geometric evolution framework: Resistance Curvature Flow (RCF). Leveraging the concept of effective resistance from circuit physics, RCF transforms expensive curvature optimization into efficient matrix operations. This approach achieves over 100x computational acceleration while maintaining geometric optimization capabilities comparable to OCF. We provide an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and dynamical principles of RCF, elucidating how it guides the redistribution of edge weights via curvature gradients to eliminate topological noise and strengthen local cluster structures. Furthermore, we provide a mechanistic explanation of RCF's role in manifold enhancement and noise suppression, as well as its compatibility with deep learning models. We design a graph optimization algorithm, DGSL-RCF, based on this framework. Experimental results across deep metric learning, manifold learning, and graph structure learning demonstrate that DGSL-RCF significantly improves representation quality and downstream task performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular foundational models show strong performance but their internal representations and learned concepts remain poorly understood, making interpretability important for understanding how these models process and transform input features.

Method: The researchers conduct probing experiments that test for the presence of linear regression coefficients, intermediate values from complex expressions, and final answers in early layers, allowing them to reason about the model's internal computations.

Result: The results show that meaningful and structured information is stored inside the representations, with clear signals corresponding to both intermediate and final quantities involved in the prediction process, revealing how models refine inputs and produce outputs.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to understanding the internal mechanics of tabular foundational models, showing they encode concrete and interpretable information that moves toward making their decision processes more transparent and trustworthy.

Abstract: Tabular foundational models are pre-trained models designed for a wide range of tabular data tasks. They have shown strong performance across domains, yet their internal representations and learned concepts remain poorly understood. This lack of interpretability makes it important to study how these models process and transform input features. In this work, we analyze the information encoded inside the model's hidden representations and examine how these representations evolve across layers. We run a set of probing experiments that test for the presence of linear regression coefficients, intermediate values from complex expressions, and the final answer in early layers. These experiments allow us to reason about the computations the model performs internally. Our results provide evidence that meaningful and structured information is stored inside the representations of tabular foundational models. We observe clear signals that correspond to both intermediate and final quantities involved in the model's prediction process. This gives insight into how the model refines its inputs and how the final output emerges. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the internal mechanics of tabular foundational models. They show that these models encode concrete and interpretable information, which moves us closer to making their decision processes more transparent and trustworthy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes CIEN framework for MARL that models collective influence of agents on task objects, enabling coordination without explicit action exchange and improving scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL approaches require frequent action/state exchanges among agents, which is impractical in real robotic systems. Estimator networks that model other agents' behaviors suffer from scalability issues as network size grows with number of agents.

Method: Introduces Collective Influence Estimation Network (CIEN) that explicitly models collective influence of other agents on task objects. Each agent infers interaction information from local observations and task object states, eliminating need for explicit action exchange.

Result: Achieves stable and efficient coordination in communication-limited environments. Shows strong scalability - network doesn't expand with team size, and new agents can be added without modifying existing network structures. Real robotic deployment demonstrates improved robustness, deployment feasibility, and reduced communication dependence.

Conclusion: CIEN framework provides scalable solution for MARL in communication-limited environments by modeling collective influence rather than individual agent behaviors, enabling practical deployment in real robotic systems with improved coordination and reduced communication requirements.

Abstract: Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has attracted considerable attention due to its potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on frequent exchanges of action or state information among agents to achieve effective coordination, which is difficult to satisfy in practical robotic systems. A common solution is to introduce estimator networks to model the behaviors of other agents and predict their actions; nevertheless, such designs cause the size and computational cost of the estimator networks to grow rapidly with the number of agents, thereby limiting scalability in large-scale systems.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multiagent learning framework augmented with a Collective Influence Estimation Network (CIEN). By explicitly modeling the collective influence of other agents on the task object, each agent can infer critical interaction information solely from its local observations and the task object's states, enabling efficient collaboration without explicit action information exchange. The proposed framework effectively avoids network expansion as the team size increases; moreover, new agents can be incorporated without modifying the network structures of existing agents, demonstrating strong scalability. Experimental results on multiagent cooperative tasks based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm show that the proposed method achieves stable and efficient coordination under communication-limited environments. Furthermore, policies trained with collective influence modeling are deployed on a real robotic platform, where experimental results indicate significantly improved robustness and deployment feasibility, along with reduced dependence on communication infrastructure.

### [219] [One-Shot Federated Ridge Regression: Exact Recovery via Sufficient Statistic Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08216)
*Zahir Alsulaimawi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: One-shot federated ridge regression eliminates iterative communication by having clients compute local sufficient statistics once, enabling exact recovery of centralized solution with massive communication reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional federated learning requires repeated client-server synchronization, which is communication-intensive. The paper investigates whether iterative communication is necessary for distributed linear regression and aims to develop a one-shot communication protocol.

Method: Formulates federated ridge regression as a distributed equilibrium problem where each client computes local Gram matrix and moment vector once, transmits them to server, which reconstructs global solution through single matrix inversion. For high-dimensional settings, uses random projection to reduce communication from O(d²) to O(m²) where m ≪ d.

Result: Proves exact recovery of centralized ridge solution under coverage condition; derives error bounds for heterogeneous distributions. Achieves 38× less communication than FedAvg while matching accuracy. Provides differential privacy guarantees with single noise injection per client, eliminating composition penalty.

Conclusion: Iterative communication is unnecessary for distributed linear regression. One-shot federated ridge regression enables exact recovery with massive communication savings, differential privacy advantages, and practical robustness to client dropout, while being applicable to kernel methods and random feature models.

Abstract: Federated learning protocols require repeated synchronization between clients and a central server, with convergence rates depending on learning rates, data heterogeneity, and client sampling. This paper asks whether iterative communication is necessary for distributed linear regression. We show it is not. We formulate federated ridge regression as a distributed equilibrium problem where each client computes local sufficient statistics -- the Gram matrix and moment vector -- and transmits them once. The server reconstructs the global solution through a single matrix inversion. We prove exact recovery: under a coverage condition on client feature matrices, one-shot aggregation yields the centralized ridge solution, not an approximation. For heterogeneous distributions violating coverage, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds depending on spectral properties of the aggregated Gram matrix. Communication reduces from $\mathcal{O}(Rd)$ in iterative methods to $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ total; for high-dimensional settings, we propose and experimentally validate random projection techniques reducing this to $\mathcal{O}(m^2)$ where $m \ll d$. We establish differential privacy guarantees where noise is injected once per client, eliminating the composition penalty that degrades privacy in multi-round protocols. We further address practical considerations including client dropout robustness, federated cross-validation for hyperparameter selection, and comparison with gradient-based alternatives. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic heterogeneous regression demonstrate that one-shot fusion matches FedAvg accuracy while requiring up to $38\times$ less communication. The framework applies to kernel methods and random feature models but not to general nonlinear architectures.

TL;DR: Agentic matrix deflation using LLM+VLM team to iteratively peel rank-1 slices without fixed thresholds, achieving competitive results with classical algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether small agent teams can perform matrix deflation without fixed norm thresholds, using human-like visual reasoning for stopping decisions.

Method: LLM generates rank-1 SVD updates, VLM accepts/rejects updates and decides when to stop. Uses in-context learning and row/column permutations to expose visually coherent structure.

Result: On synthetic noisy matrices, best agentic configuration differs by only 1.75 RMSE from numerical deflation target. On Digits and CIFAR-10, achieves competitive results with 10% Frobenius norm threshold.

Conclusion: Fully agentic, threshold-free matrix deflation is a viable alternative to classical numerical algorithms, demonstrating the potential of LLM+VLM collaboration for matrix decomposition tasks.

Abstract: Can a small team of agents peel a matrix apart, one rank-1 slice at a time? We propose an agentic approach to matrix deflation in which a solver Large Language Model (LLM) generates rank-1 Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) updates and a Vision Language Model (VLM) accepts or rejects each update and decides when to stop, eliminating fixed norm thresholds. Solver stability is improved through in-context learning (ICL) and types of row/column permutations that expose visually coherent structure. We evaluate on Digits ($8{\times}8$), CIFAR-10 ($32{\times}32$ grayscale), and synthetic ($16{\times}16$) matrices with and without Gaussian noise. In the synthetic noisy case, where the true construction rank $k$ is known, numerical deflation provides the noise target and our best agentic configuration differs by only $1.75$ RMSE of the target. For Digits and CIFAR-10, targets are defined by deflating until the Frobenius norm reaches $10\%$ of the original. Across all settings, our agent achieves competitive results, suggesting that fully agentic, threshold-free deflation is a viable alternative to classical numerical algorithms.

Motivation: GNN performance is limited by poor graph quality (noise, missing links, structural misalignment), and existing graph structure learning methods are computationally expensive due to complex generative models and iterative joint optimization.

Method: GADPN uses low-rank denoising and generalized structural perturbation to refine graph topology. It introduces Bayesian optimization to adaptively determine optimal denoising strength based on each graph's homophily level, and extends structural perturbation method to arbitrary graphs via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

Result: Extensive experiments show GADPN achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved efficiency. It shows particularly strong gains on challenging disassortative graphs, validating robust learning of enhanced graph structures across diverse network types.

Conclusion: GADPN provides a simple yet effective framework for graph structure learning that overcomes computational limitations of existing methods while achieving superior performance, especially on difficult graph types.

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on graph-structured data, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of the observed graph, which often contains noise, missing links, or structural properties misaligned with GNNs' underlying assumptions. To address this, graph structure learning aims to infer a more optimal topology. Existing methods, however, often incur high computational costs due to complex generative models and iterative joint optimization, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we propose GADPN, a simple yet effective graph structure learning framework that adaptively refines graph topology via low-rank denoising and generalized structural perturbation. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) we introduce Bayesian optimization to adaptively determine the optimal denoising strength, tailoring the process to each graph's homophily level; and (2) we extend the structural perturbation method to arbitrary graphs via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), overcoming its original limitation to symmetric structures. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GADPN achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly improving efficiency. It shows particularly strong gains on challenging disassortative graphs, validating its ability to robustly learn enhanced graph structures across diverse network types.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper integrates cognitive biases into RL frameworks for financial trading to model human-like behavior and potentially improve risk-adjusted returns, though results were inconclusive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL models assume rational agents but financial markets are influenced by human cognitive biases. The study aims to bridge this gap by incorporating psychological factors into RL for more realistic financial decision-making.

Method: The study integrates cognitive biases (overconfidence, loss aversion) into RL reward structures and decision-making processes, then evaluates performance in both simulated and real-world trading environments.

Result: The results were inconclusive or negative regarding the performance benefits of biased RL agents compared to standard RL agents in financial trading.

Conclusion: Despite inconclusive results, the study provides valuable insights into the challenges of incorporating human-like biases into RL, offering lessons for developing more robust financial AI systems.

Abstract: Financial markets are influenced by human behavior that deviates from rationality due to cognitive biases. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) models for financial decision-making assume rational agents, potentially overlooking the impact of psychological factors. This study integrates cognitive biases into RL frameworks for financial trading, hypothesizing that such models can exhibit human-like trading behavior and achieve better risk-adjusted returns than standard RL agents. We introduce biases, such as overconfidence and loss aversion, into reward structures and decision-making processes and evaluate their performance in simulated and real-world trading environments. Despite its inconclusive or negative results, this study provides insights into the challenges of incorporating human-like biases into RL, offering valuable lessons for developing robust financial AI systems.

*Jongmin Park,Seunghoon Han,Hyewon Lee,Won-Yong Shin,Sungsu Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HypHGT: A hyperbolic heterogeneous graph transformer that learns graph representations entirely in hyperbolic space using relation-specific attention with linear complexity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in node classification with better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hyperbolic methods for heterogeneous graphs have limitations: they rely heavily on tangent-space operations causing mapping distortions, and their message-passing architectures focus mainly on local neighborhood information, failing to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different node types.

Method: Proposes Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT) that operates entirely within hyperbolic space using transformer-based architecture. Introduces relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism with linear time complexity to preserve heterogeneous information across different relation types while enabling efficient computation.

Result: HypHGT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification tasks while achieving significantly reduced training time and memory usage, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: HypHGT effectively addresses limitations of existing hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs by capturing both local and global dependencies through transformer architecture, operating entirely in hyperbolic space with efficient relation-specific attention, making it suitable for learning complex structural properties in heterogeneous graphs.

Abstract: In heterogeneous graphs, we can observe complex structures such as tree-like or hierarchical structures. Recently, the hyperbolic space has been widely adopted in many studies to effectively learn these complex structures. Although these methods have demonstrated the advantages of the hyperbolic space in learning heterogeneous graphs, most existing methods still have several challenges. They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of HypHGT, and the results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification task, with significantly reduced training time and memory usage.

*Marius F. R. Juston,Ramavarapu S. Sreenivas,Dustin Nottage,Ahmet Soylemezoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Analysis of initialization dynamics for LDLT-based Lipschitz layers, deriving exact output variance for Gaussian initialization, showing current methods cause rapid information loss, and proposing improved initialization scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep Lipschitz networks suffer from rapid information loss at initialization with current initialization methods (He/Kaiming), which motivates understanding the exact output variance dynamics and finding better initialization strategies.

Method: Derived exact marginal output variance using Wishart distribution theory, James' theorem, and Laplace-integral expansions. Developed combinatorial expansion for trace moments using Isserlis/Wick theorem, providing explicit truncated moments up to k=10. Validated with Monte Carlo experiments and empirical analysis on Higgs boson dataset.

Result: Current He/Kaiming initialization (scaling 1/√n) yields output variance of 0.41, while proposed parameterization (10/√n for α=1) achieves 0.9 variance. However, empirical validation shows He initialization still performs better despite theoretical variance preservation.

Conclusion: The analysis explains why Lipschitz networks lose information rapidly at initialization and provides practical initialization prescriptions, but empirical results suggest theoretical variance preservation doesn't necessarily translate to better performance, indicating need for further investigation.

Abstract: We analyze initialization dynamics for LDLT-based $\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz layers by deriving the exact marginal output variance when the underlying parameter matrix $W_0\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is initialized with IID Gaussian entries $\mathcal{N}(0,σ^2)$. The Wishart distribution, $S=W_0W_0^\top\sim\mathcal{W}_m(n,σ^2 \boldsymbol{I}_m)$, used for computing the output marginal variance is derived in closed form using expectations of zonal polynomials via James' theorem and a Laplace-integral expansion of $(α\boldsymbol{I}_m+S)^{-1}$. We develop an Isserlis/Wick-based combinatorial expansion for $\operatorname{\mathbb{E}}\left[\operatorname{tr}(S^k)\right]$ and provide explicit truncated moments up to $k=10$, which yield accurate series approximations for small-to-moderate $σ^2$. Monte Carlo experiments confirm the theoretical estimates. Furthermore, empirical analysis was performed to quantify that, using current He or Kaiming initialization with scaling $1/\sqrt{n}$, the output variance is $0.41$, whereas the new parameterization with $10/ \sqrt{n}$ for $α=1$ results in an output variance of $0.9$. The findings clarify why deep $\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz networks suffer rapid information loss at initialization and offer practical prescriptions for choosing initialization hyperparameters to mitigate this effect. However, using the Higgs boson classification dataset, a hyperparameter sweep over optimizers, initialization scale, and depth was conducted to validate the results on real-world data, showing that although the derivation ensures variance preservation, empirical results indicate He initialization still performs better.

### [225] [On Evaluation of Unsupervised Feature Selection for Pattern Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08257)
*Gyu-Il Kim,Dae-Won Kim,Jaesung Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised feature selection evaluation using single-label datasets from multi-label data is unreliable; multi-label evaluation provides fairer comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of unsupervised feature selection methods uses single-label datasets derived from multi-label data, but this is problematic because the chosen label can vary arbitrarily, leading to inconsistent performance rankings and unreliable assessment of discriminative ability.

Method: The study adopts a multi-label classification framework for evaluation, testing several representative unsupervised feature selection methods on 21 multi-label datasets to compare performance rankings against traditional single-label evaluation.

Result: Experiments show that performance rankings of unsupervised feature selection methods differ significantly between multi-label and single-label evaluation settings, indicating that single-label evaluation is unreliable for assessing true discriminative ability.

Conclusion: Multi-label evaluation provides a fairer and more reliable comparison framework for unsupervised feature selection methods than traditional single-label evaluation, which suffers from arbitrary label selection bias.

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection aims to identify a compact subset of features that captures the intrinsic structure of data without supervised label. Most existing studies evaluate the performance of methods using the single-label dataset that can be instantiated by selecting a label from multi-label data while maintaining the original features. Because the chosen label can vary arbitrarily depending on the experimental setting, the superiority among compared methods can be changed with regard to which label happens to be selected. Thus, evaluating unsupervised feature selection methods based solely on single-label accuracy is unreasonable for assessing their true discriminative ability. This study revisits this evaluation paradigm by adopting a multi-label classification framework. Experiments on 21 multi-label datasets using several representative methods demonstrate that performance rankings differ markedly from those reported under single-label settings, suggesting the possibility of multi-label evaluation settings for fair and reliable comparison of unsupervised feature selection methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiac amyloidosis is rare and underdiagnosed, with available datasets being small, imbalanced, and heterogeneous, limiting machine learning model development

Method: Developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a graphical command-line interface to generate realistic synthetic ECG beats, allowing clinical researchers to train class-specific generators and produce large volumes of labeled synthetic data

### [227] [Demystifying the Slash Pattern in Attention: The Role of RoPE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08297)
*Yuan Cheng,Fengzhuo Zhang,Yunlong Hou,Cunxiao Du,Chao Du,Tianyu Pang,Aixin Sun,Zhuoran Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explains why Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) emerge in LLMs, showing they are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts, with both empirical analysis and theoretical proof.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often exhibit slash attention patterns where attention concentrates along diagonal offsets, which play key roles in information passing. The paper aims to demystify why these Slash-Dominant Heads emerge in transformer models.

Method: 1) Empirical analysis of open-source LLMs to show SDHs are intrinsic and generalize; 2) Analysis of queries, keys, and RoPE revealing two characteristic conditions: rank-one queries/keys and RoPE dominated by medium-high frequencies; 3) Theoretical analysis proving these conditions are sufficient for SDH emergence in shallow Transformers trained via gradient descent.

Result: SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. The two conditions (rank-one queries/keys and medium-high frequency RoPE dominance) are both empirically observed and theoretically proven to be sufficient for SDH emergence.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demystifies the emergence of Slash-Dominant Heads through combined empirical and theoretical analysis, showing they arise from specific structural properties of queries, keys, and RoPE that are learned during training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit slash attention patterns, where attention scores concentrate along the $Δ$-th sub-diagonal for some offset $Δ$. These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.

*Kun Liang,Clive Bai,Xin Xu,Chenming Tang,Sanwoo Lee,Weijie Liu,Saiyong Yang,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ORBIT: A controllable multi-budget reasoning framework that learns Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at different effort levels and distills them into a single unified model, enabling flexible trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) use overlong Chain-of-Thought reasoning at inference time, incurring unnecessary computational costs. Prior approaches that try to infer appropriate reasoning budgets are unreliable and inflexible, as they fix the cost-accuracy trade-off during training and can't adapt to varying deployment scenarios.

Method: ORBIT uses multi-stage reinforcement learning to discover Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at different effort levels, followed by on-policy distillation to fuse these behaviors into a single unified model while maintaining clear mode separation.

Result: ORBIT achieves: (1) controllable reasoning behavior over multiple modes, (2) competitive reasoning density within each mode, and (3) successful integration of frontier policies into a single student model while preserving mode separation and high per-mode performance.

Conclusion: ORBIT provides a flexible framework for controllable multi-budget reasoning that addresses the limitations of prior approaches by enabling adaptive trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy across varying deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by leveraging long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but uniformly applying overlong reasoning at inference time incurs substantial and often unnecessary computational cost. To address this, prior work explores various strategies to infer an appropriate reasoning budget from the input. However, such approaches are unreliable in the worst case, as estimating the minimal required reasoning effort is fundamentally difficult, and they implicitly fix the trade-off between reasoning cost and accuracy during training, limiting flexibility under varying deployment scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ORBIT, a controllable multi-budget reasoning framework with well-separated reasoning modes triggered by input. ORBIT employs multi-stage reinforcement learning to discover Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at each effort, followed by on-policy distillation to fuse these behaviors into a single unified model. Experiments show that ORBIT achieves (1) controllable reasoning behavior over multiple modes, (2) competitive reasoning density within each mode, and (3) integration of these frontier policies into a single unified student model while preserving clear mode separation and high per-mode performance.

### [229] [Deep Exploration of Epoch-wise Double Descent in Noisy Data: Signal Separation, Large Activation, and Benign Overfitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08316)
*Tomoki Kubo,Ryuken Uda,Yusuke Iida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates epoch-wise double descent in neural networks, showing how models can re-generalize after overfitting noisy data through internal structural evolution, connecting deep double descent, benign overfitting, and large activation phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms behind epoch-wise double descent (delayed generalization following overfitting) by examining how neural networks evolve internally during training, particularly focusing on how they handle noisy data and achieve re-generalization.

Method: Trained fully connected neural networks of three sizes on CIFAR-10 with 30% label noise. Decomposed loss curves into signal contributions from clean and noisy training data separately. Analyzed epoch-wise evolution of internal activations and signals, tracking how the network learns clean vs. noisy data.

Result: Three key findings: 1) Models achieved strong re-generalization on test data even after perfectly fitting noisy data (benign overfitting). 2) Noisy data learned after clean data, with their internal activations becoming increasingly separated in outer layers, enabling selective overfitting. 3) Emergence of single very large activations ("outliers") in shallow layers that evolve with re-generalization, correlating with input patterns but not output patterns.

Conclusion: The empirical findings directly link deep double descent, benign overfitting, and large activation phenomena, supporting a novel scenario for understanding how neural networks achieve re-generalization through internal structural evolution and selective learning of clean vs. noisy data.

Abstract: Deep double descent is one of the key phenomena underlying the generalization capability of deep learning models. In this study, epoch-wise double descent, which is delayed generalization following overfitting, was empirically investigated by focusing on the evolution of internal structures. Fully connected neural networks of three different sizes were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 30% label noise. By decomposing the loss curves into signal contributions from clean and noisy training data, the epoch-wise evolutions of internal signals were analyzed separately. Three main findings were obtained from this analysis. First, the model achieved strong re-generalization on test data even after perfectly fitting noisy training data during the double descent phase, corresponding to a "benign overfitting" state. Second, noisy data were learned after clean data, and as learning progressed, their corresponding internal activations became increasingly separated in outer layers; this enabled the model to overfit only noisy data. Third, a single, very large activation emerged in the shallow layer across all models; this phenomenon is referred as "outliers," "massive activa-tions," and "super activations" in recent large language models and evolves with re-generalization. The magnitude of large activation correlated with input patterns but not with output patterns. These empirical findings directly link the recent key phenomena of "deep double descent," "benign overfitting," and "large activation", and support the proposal of a novel scenario for understanding deep double descent.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study evaluates general-purpose and radiomics-specific AutoML frameworks on diverse radiomics classification tasks, finding that Simplatab (radiomics-specific) achieves the best performance while LightAutoML (general-purpose) offers the fastest execution with competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AutoML frameworks can lower technical barriers for radiomics model development, but their effectiveness in addressing radiomics-specific challenges remains unclear. The study aims to evaluate performance, efficiency, and accessibility of different AutoML frameworks for radiomics applications.

Method: Evaluated 6 general-purpose and 5 radiomics-specific AutoML frameworks on 10 public/private radiomics datasets with varied imaging modalities (CT/MRI), sizes, anatomies and endpoints. Used standardized cross-validation with predefined parameters, measuring AUC, runtime, and qualitative aspects like software status, accessibility, and interpretability.

Result: Simplatab (radiomics-specific) achieved highest average test AUC (81.81%) with moderate runtime (~1 hour). LightAutoML (general-purpose) showed fastest execution with competitive performance (78.74% mean AUC in 6 minutes). Most radiomics-specific frameworks were excluded due to obsolescence, programming requirements, or computational inefficiency, while general-purpose frameworks demonstrated higher accessibility.

Conclusion: Simplatab provides effective balance of performance, efficiency, and accessibility for radiomics classification, but significant gaps remain including lack of accessible survival analysis support and limited integration of feature reproducibility/harmonization. Future research should focus on adapting AutoML solutions to better address radiomics-specific challenges.

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks can lower technical barriers for predictive and prognostic model development in radiomics by enabling researchers without programming expertise to build models. However, their effectiveness in addressing radiomics-specific challenges remains unclear. This study evaluates the performance, efficiency, and accessibility of general-purpose and radiomics-specific AutoML frameworks on diverse radiomics classification tasks, thereby highlighting development needs for radiomics. Ten public/private radiomics datasets with varied imaging modalities (CT/MRI), sizes, anatomies and endpoints were used. Six general-purpose and five radiomics-specific frameworks were tested with predefined parameters using standardized cross-validation. Evaluation metrics included AUC, runtime, together with qualitative aspects related to software status, accessibility, and interpretability. Simplatab, a radiomics-specific tool with a no-code interface, achieved the highest average test AUC (81.81%) with a moderate runtime (~1 hour). LightAutoML, a general-purpose framework, showed the fastest execution with competitive performance (78.74% mean AUC in six minutes). Most radiomics-specific frameworks were excluded from the performance analysis due to obsolescence, extensive programming requirements, or computational inefficiency. Conversely, general-purpose frameworks demonstrated higher accessibility and ease of implementation. Simplatab provides an effective balance of performance, efficiency, and accessibility for radiomics classification problems. However, significant gaps remain, including the lack of accessible survival analysis support and the limited integration of feature reproducibility and harmonization within current AutoML frameworks. Future research should focus on adapting AutoML solutions to better address these radiomics-specific challenges.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First empirical study of transfer learning for Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition (UATR) shows pretrained audio models with linear probing can effectively recognize ship types while suppressing recording-specific noise, reducing need for labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual analysis of large-scale underwater recordings from Passive Acoustic Monitoring systems is impractical. Supervised learning for UATR is limited by scarce labeled data, motivating exploration of transfer learning alternatives.

Method: Comparative study of transfer learning for UATR using multiple pretrained audio models from diverse domains. Model weights are frozen, embeddings analyzed through classification, clustering, and similarity-based evaluations. Linear probing used to isolate ship-type features.

Result: Embedding space dominated by recording-specific characteristics, but linear probing effectively suppresses this noise and isolates ship-type features. Enables effective UATR at low computational cost with minimal labeled data.

Conclusion: Transfer learning with pretrained audio models and linear probing offers practical solution for automated ship noise monitoring, significantly reducing dependency on large labeled datasets while maintaining effectiveness.

Abstract: Increasing levels of anthropogenic noise from ships contribute significantly to underwater sound pollution, posing risks to marine ecosystems. This makes monitoring crucial to understand and quantify the impact of the ship radiated noise. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) systems are widely deployed for this purpose, generating years of underwater recordings across diverse soundscapes. Manual analysis of such large-scale data is impractical, motivating the need for automated approaches based on machine learning. Recent advances in automatic Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition (UATR) have largely relied on supervised learning, which is constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. Transfer Learning (TL) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this limitation. In this work, we conduct the first empirical comparative study of transfer learning for UATR, evaluating multiple pretrained audio models originating from diverse audio domains. The pretrained model weights are frozen, and the resulting embeddings are analyzed through classification, clustering, and similarity-based evaluations. The analysis shows that the geometrical structure of the embedding space is largely dominated by recording-specific characteristics. However, a simple linear probe can effectively suppress this recording-specific information and isolate ship-type features from these embeddings. As a result, linear probing enables effective automatic UATR using pretrained audio models at low computational cost, significantly reducing the need for a large amounts of high-quality labeled ship recordings.

*Matina Mahdizadeh Sani,Nima Jamali,Mohammad Jalali,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MMD Guidance is a training-free method that uses Maximum Mean Discrepancy gradients during reverse diffusion to align generated samples with target distributions using only a few reference examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained diffusion models often produce outputs that don't match user-specific target data characteristics, especially problematic in domain adaptation tasks where only few reference examples are available and retraining is infeasible. Existing methods optimize surrogate objectives rather than directly aligning with target distributions.

Method: Proposes MMD Guidance that augments reverse diffusion process with gradients of Maximum Mean Discrepancy between generated samples and reference dataset. MMD provides reliable distributional estimates from limited data, has low variance, and is efficiently differentiable. Extends to prompt-aware adaptation via product kernels and works efficiently in latent diffusion models.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that MMD Guidance achieves distributional alignment while preserving sample fidelity.

Conclusion: MMD Guidance offers an effective training-free approach for domain adaptation with diffusion models using only a few reference examples, directly aligning generated distributions with target characteristics while maintaining sample quality.

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for both unconditional and conditional sample generation, yet their outputs often deviate from the characteristics of user-specific target data. Such mismatches are especially problematic in domain adaptation tasks, where only a few reference examples are available and retraining the diffusion model is infeasible. Existing inference-time guidance methods can adjust sampling trajectories, but they typically optimize surrogate objectives such as classifier likelihoods rather than directly aligning with the target distribution. We propose MMD Guidance, a training-free mechanism that augments the reverse diffusion process with gradients of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between generated samples and a reference dataset. MMD provides reliable distributional estimates from limited data, exhibits low variance in practice, and is efficiently differentiable, which makes it particularly well-suited for the guidance task. Our framework naturally extends to prompt-aware adaptation in conditional generation models via product kernels. Also, it can be applied with computational efficiency in latent diffusion models (LDMs), since guidance is applied in the latent space of the LDM. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that MMD Guidance can achieve distributional alignment while preserving sample fidelity.

TL;DR: SSO is a new optimizer that enforces spectral constraints on both weights and updates, achieving full μP alignment and outperforming AdamW and Muon in large-scale pretraining with improved stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optimizers like Muon are only "half-aligned" with μP theory - they control updates but allow weights to drift, creating a gap between theoretical stability guarantees and practical optimization.

Method: Introduces Spectral Sphere Optimizer (SSO) which enforces strict module-wise spectral constraints on both weights and their updates by deriving steepest descent direction on the spectral sphere, implemented as efficient parallel algorithm in Megatron.

Result: SSO consistently outperforms AdamW and Muon in pretraining diverse architectures (Dense 1.7B, MoE 8B-A1B, 200-layer DeepNet), with significant stability benefits including improved MoE router load balancing, suppressed outliers, and strictly bounded activations.

Conclusion: SSO provides a fully μP-aligned optimization framework that bridges theoretical stability guarantees with practical large-scale training, delivering both superior performance and enhanced stability across diverse model architectures.

Abstract: Scaling large models requires optimization strategies that ensure rapid convergence grounded in stability. Maximal Update Parametrization ($\boldsymbolμ$P) provides a theoretical safeguard for width-invariant $Θ(1)$ activation control, whereas emerging optimizers like Muon are only ``half-aligned'' with these constraints: they control updates but allow weights to drift. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Spectral Sphere Optimizer (SSO)}, which enforces strict module-wise spectral constraints on both weights and their updates. By deriving the steepest descent direction on the spectral sphere, SSO realizes a fully $\boldsymbolμ$P-aligned optimization process. To enable large-scale training, we implement SSO as an efficient parallel algorithm within Megatron. Through extensive pretraining on diverse architectures, including Dense 1.7B, MoE 8B-A1B, and 200-layer DeepNet models, SSO consistently outperforms AdamW and Muon. Furthermore, we observe significant practical stability benefits, including improved MoE router load balancing, suppressed outliers, and strictly bounded activations.

*Binh Duong Nguyen,Stefan Sandfeld*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multi-channel U-Net outperforms complex architectures (ViT, AFNO, PDE-Transformer, KAN-UNet) for 2D PDE surrogate modeling in small-data settings with O(10²) trajectories, showing better generalization to out-of-distribution initial conditions with only ~20 training simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity PDE simulations are computationally expensive, but many scientific applications involve evolution of spatially distributed fields. There's a need for data-driven forecasting methods that work well in strict small-data settings with limited training trajectories.

Method: Introduces a multi-channel U-Net architecture for autoregressive deep-learning surrogates of 2D PDE dynamics on periodic domains. Evaluated on five qualitatively different PDE families and compared to ViT, AFNO, PDE-Transformer, and KAN-UNet under common training setup.

Result: Across all datasets, me-UNet matches or outperforms more complex architectures in field-space error, spectral similarity, and physics-based metrics for in-distribution rollouts, while requiring substantially less training time. Generalizes qualitatively to unseen initial conditions with as few as ~20 training simulations.

Conclusion: In small-data periodic 2D PDE settings, convolutional architectures with inductive biases aligned to locality and periodic boundary conditions (like U-Net) remain strong contenders for accurate and moderately out-of-distribution-robust surrogate modeling, outperforming more complex transformer-based approaches.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are a central tool for modeling the dynamics of physical, engineering, and materials systems, but high-fidelity simulations are often computationally expensive. At the same time, many scientific applications can be viewed as the evolution of spatially distributed fields, making data-driven forecasting of such fields a core task in scientific machine learning. In this work we study autoregressive deep-learning surrogates for two-dimensional PDE dynamics on periodic domains, focusing on generalization to out-of-distribution initial conditions within a fixed PDE and parameter regime and on strict small-data settings with at most $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ simulated trajectories per system. We introduce a multi-channel U-Net [...], evaluate it on five qualitatively different PDE families and compare it to ViT, AFNO, PDE-Transformer, and KAN-UNet under a common training setup. Across all datasets, me-UNet matches or outperforms these more complex architectures in terms of field-space error, spectral similarity, and physics-based metrics for in-distribution rollouts, while requiring substantially less training time. It also generalizes qualitatively to unseen initial conditions with as few as $\approx 20$ training simulations. A data-efficiency study and Grad-CAM analysis further suggest that, in small-data periodic 2D PDE settings, convolutional architectures with inductive biases aligned to locality and periodic boundary conditions remain strong contenders for accurate and moderately out-of-distribution-robust surrogate modeling.

TL;DR: Taxon is a hierarchical tax code prediction framework for e-commerce that uses mixture-of-experts architecture and LLM-based semantic verification to accurately map products to multi-level tax codes, deployed in Alibaba's system handling 500K+ daily queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tax code prediction is crucial for automating invoicing and compliance in e-commerce but remains underexplored. Errors in mapping products to multi-level tax hierarchies cause financial inconsistencies and regulatory risks, necessitating accurate and robust solutions.

Method: Taxon integrates: (1) feature-gating mixture-of-experts architecture that adaptively routes multi-modal features across taxonomy levels, and (2) semantic consistency model distilled from LLMs to verify alignment between product titles and official tax definitions. Uses multi-source training pipeline combining curated tax databases, invoice validation logs, and merchant registration data to handle noisy supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on proprietary TaxCode dataset and public benchmarks. Full hierarchical paths reconstruction significantly improves structural consistency with highest overall F1 scores. Deployed in Alibaba's tax service system handling 500K+ daily queries (peak 5M+ during events) with improved accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.

Conclusion: Taxon provides an effective framework for hierarchical tax code prediction that combines expert-guided architecture with semantic verification, successfully deployed in production to handle large-scale e-commerce tax compliance with improved performance and reliability.

Abstract: Tax code prediction is a crucial yet underexplored task in automating invoicing and compliance management for large-scale e-commerce platforms. Each product must be accurately mapped to a node within a multi-level taxonomic hierarchy defined by national standards, where errors lead to financial inconsistencies and regulatory risks. This paper presents Taxon, a semantically aligned and expert-guided framework for hierarchical tax code prediction. Taxon integrates (i) a feature-gating mixture-of-experts architecture that adaptively routes multi-modal features across taxonomy levels, and (ii) a semantic consistency model distilled from large language models acting as domain experts to verify alignment between product titles and official tax definitions. To address noisy supervision in real business records, we design a multi-source training pipeline that combines curated tax databases, invoice validation logs, and merchant registration data to provide both structural and semantic supervision. Extensive experiments on the proprietary TaxCode dataset and public benchmarks demonstrate that Taxon achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines. Further, an additional full hierarchical paths reconstruction procedure significantly improves structural consistency, yielding the highest overall F1 scores. Taxon has been deployed in production within Alibaba's tax service system, handling an average of over 500,000 tax code queries per day and reaching peak volumes above five million requests during business event with improved accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.

*Juno Kim,Jihun Yun,Jason D. Lee,Kwang-Sung Jun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online on-policy DPO converges exponentially faster than offline methods due to coverage improvement principle, with theoretical analysis showing sharp sample complexity separation. Proposed hybrid sampler removes coverage dependence for two-round convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online on-policy preference learning algorithms like DPO outperform offline counterparts, but there's no theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. The paper aims to provide theoretical understanding of why on-policy methods work better and develop improved algorithms.

Method: 1) Theoretical analysis of coverage evolution during on-policy training, establishing the coverage improvement principle. 2) Analysis in contextual bandit setting with Bradley-Terry preferences and linear softmax policy class. 3) Proposed hybrid sampler based on preferential G-optimal design. 4) Developed principled on-policy schemes for reward distillation in general function class setting.

Result: 1) On-policy DPO converges exponentially in iterations for sufficient batch size, while offline methods suffer slower minimax rate. 2) Hybrid sampler removes coverage dependence and guarantees convergence in two rounds. 3) Faster noiseless rates under deviation-based coverage notion. 4) Experimental confirmation that on-policy DPO and proposed algorithms outperform off-policy counterparts with stable, monotonic gains.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical foundation for on-policy preference learning superiority, introduces coverage improvement principle, and develops practical algorithms that achieve faster convergence with theoretical guarantees, bridging theory and practice in language model alignment.

Abstract: Online on-policy preference learning algorithms for language model alignment such as online direct policy optimization (DPO) can significantly outperform their offline counterparts. We provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by analyzing how the sampling policy's coverage evolves throughout on-policy training. We propose and rigorously justify the \emph{coverage improvement principle}: with sufficient batch size, each update moves into a region around the target where coverage is uniformly better, making subsequent data increasingly informative and enabling rapid convergence. In the contextual bandit setting with Bradley-Terry preferences and linear softmax policy class, we show that on-policy DPO converges exponentially in the number of iterations for batch size exceeding a generalized coverage threshold. In contrast, any learner restricted to offline samples from the initial policy suffers a slower minimax rate, leading to a sharp separation in total sample complexity. Motivated by this analysis, we further propose a simple hybrid sampler based on a novel \emph{preferential} G-optimal design, which removes dependence on coverage and guarantees convergence in just two rounds. Finally, we develop principled on-policy schemes for reward distillation in the general function class setting, and show faster noiseless rates under an alternative deviation-based notion of coverage. Experimentally, we confirm that on-policy DPO and our proposed reward distillation algorithms outperform their off-policy counterparts and enjoy stable, monotonic performance gains across iterations.

TL;DR: DiffMM: An encoder-diffusion framework for map matching sparse GPS trajectories using one-step diffusion with road segment-aware joint embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing map matching methods (HMM-based or encoder-decoder) struggle with noisy or sparsely sampled GPS trajectories, creating challenges for trajectory-based applications like traffic scheduling and flow analysis.

Method: 1) Road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds input trajectory and surrounding candidate road segments into shared latent space using attention mechanism. 2) One-step diffusion method using shortcut model that leverages joint embeddings as conditioning context for map matching.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets show DiffMM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency, especially for sparse trajectories and complex road network topologies.

Conclusion: DiffMM provides an effective and efficient solution for map matching sparse trajectories through encoder-diffusion framework, addressing limitations of existing methods and demonstrating superior performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Map matching for sparse trajectories is a fundamental problem for many trajectory-based applications, e.g., traffic scheduling and traffic flow analysis. Existing methods for map matching are generally based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or encoder-decoder framework. However, these methods continue to face significant challenges when handling noisy or sparsely sampled GPS trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose DiffMM, an encoder-diffusion-based map matching framework that produces effective yet efficient matching results through a one-step diffusion process. We first introduce a road segment-aware trajectory encoder that jointly embeds the input trajectory and its surrounding candidate road segments into a shared latent space through an attention mechanism. Next, we propose a one step diffusion method to realize map matching through a shortcut model by leveraging the joint embedding of the trajectory and candidate road segments as conditioning context. We conduct extensive experiments on large-scale trajectory datasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art map matching methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, particularly for sparse trajectories and complex road network topologies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TFN is a multi-modal embedding model that integrates irregular time series and clinical narratives for post-kidney transplant outcome prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance on graft loss, rejection, and mortality prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical care involves heterogeneous data sources including irregular longitudinal time series and unstructured clinical narratives. Existing models often handle these modalities separately or don't effectively integrate them, limiting predictive performance and clinical interpretability in complex scenarios like post-kidney transplant care.

Method: Temporal Fusion Nexus (TFN) is a multi-modal, task-agnostic embedding model designed to integrate irregular time series data with unstructured clinical narratives. The model was evaluated on a retrospective cohort of 3382 kidney transplant patients for three key outcomes: graft loss, graft rejection, and mortality. The approach includes disentanglement metrics for interpretable latent factors and SHAP-based attributions for clinical alignment.

Result: TFN achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in post-KTx care: graft loss (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94), graft rejection (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.74), and mortality (AUC 0.86). It outperformed unimodal baselines by approximately 10% AUC over time-series-only models and 5% over time-series with static data. Clinical text integration improved performance across all tasks, with robust disentanglement metrics and SHAP attributions confirming clinical alignment.

Conclusion: TFN effectively integrates heterogeneous clinical data sources (irregular time series and narratives) to improve predictive performance for post-transplant outcomes. The model's interpretable latent factors and clinical alignment through SHAP attributions demonstrate its potential for broader clinical applications beyond kidney transplantation where similar data characteristics exist.

Abstract: We introduce Temporal Fusion Nexus (TFN), a multi-modal and task-agnostic embedding model to integrate irregular time series and unstructured clinical narratives. We analysed TFN in post-kidney transplant (KTx) care, with a retrospective cohort of 3382 patients, on three key outcomes: graft loss, graft rejection, and mortality. Compared to state-of-the-art model in post KTx care, TFN achieved higher performance for graft loss (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94) and graft rejection (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.74). In mortality prediction, TFN yielded an AUC of 0.86. TFN outperformed unimodal baselines (approx 10% AUC improvement over time series only baseline, approx 5% AUC improvement over time series with static patient data). Integrating clinical text improved performance across all tasks. Disentanglement metrics confirmed robust and interpretable latent factors in the embedding space, and SHAP-based attributions confirmed alignment with clinical reasoning. TFN has potential application in clinical tasks beyond KTx, where heterogeneous data sources, irregular longitudinal data, and rich narrative documentation are available.

TL;DR: Group-based RL methods like GRPO have biased advantage estimators that underestimate hard prompts and overestimate easy ones. The paper proposes HA-DW, an adaptive reweighting scheme to correct this bias, improving performance on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group-based RL methods (GRPO and variants) are widely used for post-training LLMs on reasoning tasks, but their group-relative advantage estimators have poorly understood theoretical properties. The authors discovered these estimators are inherently biased, leading to imbalanced exploration and exploitation.

Method: Proposed History-Aware Adaptive Difficulty Weighting (HA-DW), an adaptive reweighting scheme that adjusts advantage estimates based on an evolving difficulty anchor and training dynamics. This corrects the systematic bias in group-relative advantage estimation.

Result: HA-DW consistently improves performance when integrated into GRPO and its variants across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Both theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of correcting biased advantage estimation.

Conclusion: Correcting biased advantage estimation is critical for robust and efficient RLVR training. The proposed HA-DW method addresses fundamental issues in group-based RL and improves performance on reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a widely used approach for post-training large language models on reasoning tasks, with group-based methods such as GRPO and its variants gaining broad adoption. These methods rely on group-relative advantage estimation to avoid learned critics, yet its theoretical properties remain poorly understood.
  In this work, we uncover a fundamental issue of group-based RL: the group-relative advantage estimator is inherently biased relative to the true (expected) advantage. We provide the first theoretical analysis showing that it systematically underestimates advantages for hard prompts and overestimates them for easy prompts, leading to imbalanced exploration and exploitation. To address this issue, we propose History-Aware Adaptive Difficulty Weighting (HA-DW), an adaptive reweighting scheme that adjusts advantage estimates based on an evolving difficulty anchor and training dynamics. Both theoretical analysis and experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HA-DW consistently improves performance when integrated into GRPO and its variants. Our results suggest that correcting biased advantage estimation is critical for robust and efficient RLVR training.

*Sucheta Ghosh,Zahra Monfared,Felix Dietrich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-stage multitask learning framework for EEG analysis combining denoising autoencoder, dynamical modeling, and self-supervised representation learning to improve robustness and decoding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust EEG analysis framework that integrates denoising, dynamical modeling, and representation learning to handle artifacts, capture nonlinear brain dynamics, and improve generalization across datasets.

Method: Two-stage approach: Stage 1 uses denoising autoencoder for artifact suppression and signal stabilization. Stage 2 employs multitask architecture with convolutional backbone + Transformer encoder for three objectives: motor imagery classification, chaotic vs non-chaotic regime discrimination (using Lyapunov exponents), and self-supervised contrastive learning with NT-Xent loss.

Result: Framework enhances robustness and generalization, surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods in EEG decoding, demonstrating effectiveness of combining denoising, dynamical features, and self-supervised learning.

Conclusion: The staged design successfully mitigates interference between reconstruction and discriminative tasks, improves stability across datasets, supports reproducible training by separating noise reduction from feature learning, and shows the value of integrating denoising, dynamical modeling, and self-supervised learning for EEG analysis.

Abstract: We introduce a two-stage multitask learning framework for analyzing Electroencephalography (EEG) signals that integrates denoising, dynamical modeling, and representation learning. In the first stage, a denoising autoencoder is trained to suppress artifacts and stabilize temporal dynamics, providing robust signal representations. In the second stage, a multitask architecture processes these denoised signals to achieve three objectives: motor imagery classification, chaotic versus non-chaotic regime discrimination using Lyapunov exponent-based labels, and self-supervised contrastive representation learning with NT-Xent loss. A convolutional backbone combined with a Transformer encoder captures spatial-temporal structure, while the dynamical task encourages sensitivity to nonlinear brain dynamics. This staged design mitigates interference between reconstruction and discriminative goals, improves stability across datasets, and supports reproducible training by clearly separating noise reduction from higher-level feature learning. Empirical studies show that our framework not only enhances robustness and generalization but also surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods in EEG decoding, highlighting the effectiveness of combining denoising, dynamical features, and self-supervised learning.

Motivation: Need for both intelligibility and accurate uncertainty estimation in reliable decision-making systems. Standard Bayesian neural networks and previous evidential methods lack explicit feature interpretability.

Method: Extension of evidential learning integrated with Neural Additive Models (NAMs). Enables simultaneous estimation of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty plus explicit feature contributions in a single forward pass.

Result: EviNAM matches state-of-the-art predictive performance on synthetic and real data. Provides both uncertainty quantification and feature interpretability.

Conclusion: EviNAM offers a path toward more intelligible and trustworthy predictions, naturally extending to classification and generalized additive models beyond regression.

Abstract: Intelligibility and accurate uncertainty estimation are crucial for reliable decision-making. In this paper, we propose EviNAM, an extension of evidential learning that integrates the interpretability of Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with principled uncertainty estimation. Unlike standard Bayesian neural networks and previous evidential methods, EviNAM enables, in a single pass, both the estimation of the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty as well as explicit feature contributions. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that EviNAM matches state-of-the-art predictive performance. While we focus on regression, our method extends naturally to classification and generalized additive models, offering a path toward more intelligible and trustworthy predictions.

*Yaohui Huang,Runmin Zou,Yun Wang,Laeeq Aslam,Ruipeng Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M²FMoE is an extreme-adaptive forecasting model that uses multi-resolution and multi-view frequency modeling to capture both regular patterns and extreme events in time series without requiring extreme-event labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series forecasting methods perform poorly during extreme events due to their high variance, irregular dynamics, and sparse but high-impact nature. Current approaches fail to capture the complex temporal dynamics of extreme events even when using auxiliary signals.

Method: Three-module architecture: (1) Multi-view frequency mixture-of-experts with cross-view shared band splitter aligning Fourier and Wavelet domains, (2) Multi-resolution adaptive fusion hierarchically aggregating frequency features from coarse to fine resolutions, (3) Temporal gating integration dynamically balancing long-term trends and short-term frequency-aware features.

Result: Experiments on real-world hydrological datasets with extreme patterns show M²FMoE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines without requiring extreme-event labels.

Conclusion: M²FMoE effectively addresses the challenge of forecasting time series with extreme events by learning both regular and extreme patterns through multi-resolution and multi-view frequency modeling, demonstrating superior performance on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Forecasting time series with extreme events is critical yet challenging due to their high variance, irregular dynamics, and sparse but high-impact nature. While existing methods excel in modeling dominant regular patterns, their performance degrades significantly during extreme events, constituting the primary source of forecasting errors in real-world applications. Although some approaches incorporate auxiliary signals to improve performance, they still fail to capture extreme events' complex temporal dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose M$^2$FMoE, an extreme-adaptive forecasting model that learns both regular and extreme patterns through multi-resolution and multi-view frequency modeling. It comprises three modules: (1) a multi-view frequency mixture-of-experts module assigns experts to distinct spectral bands in Fourier and Wavelet domains, with cross-view shared band splitter aligning frequency partitions and enabling inter-expert collaboration to capture both dominant and rare fluctuations; (2) a multi-resolution adaptive fusion module that hierarchically aggregates frequency features from coarse to fine resolutions, enhancing sensitivity to both short-term variations and sudden changes; (3) a temporal gating integration module that dynamically balances long-term trends and short-term frequency-aware features, improving adaptability to both regular and extreme temporal patterns. Experiments on real-world hydrological datasets with extreme patterns demonstrate that M$^2$FMoE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines without requiring extreme-event labels.

TL;DR: Safe RL algorithms for MDPs with reach-avoid safety constraints using OFU principle and entropy regularization to ensure high-probability safety during learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning optimal policies for Markov decision processes while ensuring safety constraints during the learning phase is challenging. Existing methods may violate safety requirements while exploring, which is unacceptable in safety-critical applications.

Method: Two algorithms: 1) Based on optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU) principle, 2) Main algorithm that adds entropy regularization to the OFU-based approach. Both ensure safety with arbitrarily high probability in reach-avoid setup.

Result: Finite-sample analysis with derived regret bounds. Entropy regularization improves regret and significantly reduces episode-to-episode variability inherent in OFU-based safe RL algorithms.

Conclusion: Entropy regularization enhances OFU-based safe RL by improving regret performance and stabilizing learning dynamics while maintaining high-probability safety guarantees.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy for Markov decision processes with safety constraints. We formulate the problem in a reach-avoid setup. Our goal is to design online reinforcement learning algorithms that ensure safety constraints with arbitrarily high probability during the learning phase. To this end, we first propose an algorithm based on the optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU) principle. Based on the first algorithm, we propose our main algorithm, which utilizes entropy regularization. We investigate the finite-sample analysis of both algorithms and derive their regret bounds. We demonstrate that the inclusion of entropy regularization improves the regret and drastically controls the episode-to-episode variability that is inherent in OFU-based safe RL algorithms.

Motivation: Anomaly detection in high-dimensional, time-dependent simulation data is challenging due to complex spatial and temporal dynamics, requiring methods that can handle both aspects effectively.

Method: Used reconstruction-based anomaly detection with convolutional autoencoders on ensemble data from parameterized Kármán vortex street simulations. Compared 2D autoencoder (single frames) with 3D autoencoder (short temporal stacks).

Result: 2D model identified localized spatial irregularities in single time steps, while 3D model exploited spatio-temporal context to detect anomalous motion patterns and reduced redundant detections across time. Reconstruction errors were strongly influenced by spatial distribution of mass (concentrated regions yielded larger errors than dispersed configurations).

Conclusion: Temporal context is crucial for robust anomaly detection in dynamic simulations, with 3D autoencoders providing better performance by capturing spatio-temporal patterns.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in high-dimensional, time-dependent simulation data is challenging due to complex spatial and temporal dynamics. We study reconstruction-based anomaly detection for ensemble data from parameterized Kármán vortex street simulations using convolutional autoencoders. We compare a 2D autoencoder operating on individual frames with a 3D autoencoder that processes short temporal stacks. The 2D model identifies localized spatial irregularities in single time steps, while the 3D model exploits spatio-temporal context to detect anomalous motion patterns and reduces redundant detections across time. We further evaluate volumetric time-dependent data and find that reconstruction errors are strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of mass, with highly concentrated regions yielding larger errors than dispersed configurations. Our results highlight the importance of temporal context for robust anomaly detection in dynamic simulations.

Conclusion: Soft-partition kernel adaptation provides a fast, architecture-free approach for multiscale PDEs with broad potential for future physics-informed modeling, though currently demonstrated only on steady linear PDEs.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning holds great promise for solving differential equations, yet existing methods struggle with highly oscillatory, multiscale, or singularly perturbed PDEs due to spectral bias, costly backpropagation, and manually tuned kernel or Fourier frequencies.

*Bert Verbruggen,Arne Vanhoyweghen,Vincent Ginis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep RL fails in non-ergodic environments due to reliance on ensemble averages; adding explicit time dependence to function approximation enables optimal policies without environmental modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL uses expected values (Bellman equation) that assume ergodicity, but in non-ergodic environments, ensemble averages diverge from time-average growth, leading to systematically suboptimal policies.

Method: Introduce explicit time dependence into deep RL learning process by allowing network's function approximation to incorporate temporal information, enabling estimation of value functions consistent with intrinsic growth rates.

Result: Deep RL implementations produce suboptimal policies under non-ergodic dynamics, but adding temporal information to function approximation corrects this limitation without altering environmental feedback.

Conclusion: Explicit time dependence in deep RL enables optimal policies in non-ergodic environments by aligning value estimation with time-average growth rather than ensemble averages, contributing to RL methods for non-ergodic systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a central optimisation framework in machine learning. Although RL agents can converge to optimal solutions, the definition of ``optimality'' depends on the environment's statistical properties. The Bellman equation, central to most RL algorithms, is formulated in terms of expected values of future rewards. However, when ergodicity is broken, long-term outcomes depend on the specific trajectory rather than on the ensemble average. In such settings, the ensemble average diverges from the time-average growth experienced by individual agents, with expected-value formulations yielding systematically suboptimal policies. Prior studies demonstrated that traditional RL architectures fail to recover the true optimum in non-ergodic environments. We extend this analysis to deep RL implementations and show that these, too, produce suboptimal policies under non-ergodic dynamics. Introducing explicit time dependence into the learning process can correct this limitation. By allowing the network's function approximation to incorporate temporal information, the agent can estimate value functions consistent with the process's intrinsic growth rate. This improvement does not require altering the environmental feedback, such as reward transformations or modified objective functions, but arises naturally from the agent's exposure to temporal trajectories. Our results contribute to the growing body of research on reinforcement learning methods for non-ergodic systems.

TL;DR: Quantum Boltzmann Machines outperform Classical Boltzmann Machines in both accuracy (83.5% vs 54%) and interpretability on MNIST classification, demonstrating quantum-classical hybrid models can improve AI trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems lack explainability, especially in high-stakes domains like health and finance where understanding decisions is crucial. There's a need for more transparent AI frameworks.

Method: Comparative study of Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) vs Classical Boltzmann Machines (CBMs) on binarised MNIST with PCA preprocessing. QBMs use hybrid quantum-classical circuits with entangling layers, CBMs use contrastive divergence. Interpretability assessed via gradient-based saliency maps for QBMs and SHAP for CBMs.

Result: QBMs achieved 83.5% accuracy vs 54% for CBMs. QBMs showed more concentrated feature attributions (entropy 1.27 vs 1.39), indicating clearer identification of important features behind predictions.

Conclusion: Quantum-classical hybrid models can improve both accuracy and interpretability, moving toward more trustworthy and explainable AI systems.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have shown good success at classifying. However, the lack of explainability is a true and significant challenge, especially in high-stakes domains, such as health and finance, where understanding is paramount. We propose a new solution to this challenge: an explainable AI framework based on our comparative study with Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) and Classical Boltzmann Machines (CBMs). We leverage principles of quantum computing within classical machine learning to provide substantive transparency around decision-making. The design involves training both models on a binarised and dimensionally reduced MNIST dataset, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for preprocessing. For interpretability, we employ gradient-based saliency maps in QBMs and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in CBMs to evaluate feature attributions.QBMs deploy hybrid quantum-classical circuits with strongly entangling layers, allowing for richer latent representations, whereas CBMs serve as a classical baseline that utilises contrastive divergence. Along the way, we found that QBMs outperformed CBMs on classification accuracy (83.5% vs. 54%) and had more concentrated distributions in feature attributions as quantified by entropy (1.27 vs. 1.39). In other words, QBMs not only produced better predictive performance than CBMs, but they also provided clearer identification of "active ingredient" or the most important features behind model predictions. To conclude, our results illustrate that quantum-classical hybrid models can display improvements in both accuracy and interpretability, which leads us toward more trustworthy and explainable AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes AGING BANDIT WITH ADAPTIVE RESET algorithm for decentralized collaborative requesting in edge networks to optimize information freshness, addressing non-stationary, partially observable, and coupled multi-armed bandit problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing information freshness (Age of Information) for time-sensitive clients in edge networks where clients request content through access nodes without observing node states or other clients' actions, creating a challenging decentralized, partially observable environment.

Method: Proposes AGING BANDIT WITH ADAPTIVE RESET algorithm that combines adaptive windowing with periodic monitoring to track evolving reward distributions in non-stationary multi-armed bandit setting with history-dependent and coupled rewards across clients.

Result: Establishes theoretical performance guarantees showing near-optimal performance and validates results through simulations, demonstrating effectiveness in handling both abrupt and gradual changes in expected rewards.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively addresses the challenges of decentralized collaborative requesting in edge networks with non-stationary, partially observable, and coupled reward processes, achieving near-optimal information freshness optimization.

Abstract: We study a decentralized collaborative requesting problem that aims to optimize the information freshness of time-sensitive clients in edge networks consisting of multiple clients, access nodes (ANs), and servers. Clients request content through ANs acting as gateways, without observing AN states or the actions of other clients. We define the reward as the age of information reduction resulting from a client's selection of an AN, and formulate the problem as a non-stationary multi-armed bandit. In this decentralized and partially observable setting, the resulting reward process is history-dependent and coupled across clients, and exhibits both abrupt and gradual changes in expected rewards, rendering classical bandit-based approaches ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose the AGING BANDIT WITH ADAPTIVE RESET algorithm, which combines adaptive windowing with periodic monitoring to track evolving reward distributions. We establish theoretical performance guarantees showing that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance, and we validate the theoretical results through simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning to address exploration collapse in RL for LLMs by rewarding rare high-level solution strategies rather than redundant ones, improving pass@k diversity without sacrificing pass@1 performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL for LLMs suffers from exploration collapse where policies prematurely concentrate on a small set of dominant reasoning patterns, improving pass@1 but limiting rollout-level diversity and gains in pass@k. This happens because RL regularizes local token behavior rather than promoting diversity over sets of solutions.

Method: Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to high-level solution strategies (ignoring superficial variations), then reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. This rewards correct but novel strategies more than redundant ones.

Result: Across mathematics, physics, and medical reasoning benchmarks, the approach consistently improves pass@k across large sampling budgets and increases the area under the pass@k curve (AUC@K) without sacrificing pass@1. It sustains exploration and uncovers more diverse solution strategies at scale.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses exploration collapse in RL for LLMs by explicitly promoting diversity at the rollout level, leading to better performance on complex reasoning tasks while maintaining solution diversity.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), particularly for complex reasoning tasks, yet it often suffers from exploration collapse: policies prematurely concentrate on a small set of dominant reasoning patterns, improving pass@1 while limiting rollout-level diversity and gains in pass@k. We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. As a result, correct but novel strategies receive higher rewards than redundant ones. Across mathematics, physics, and medical reasoning benchmarks, our approach consistently improves pass@$k$ across large sampling budgets and increases the area under the pass@$k$ curve (AUC@$K$) without sacrificing pass@1, while sustaining exploration and uncovering more diverse solution strategies at scale.

### [250] [Asymptotic Universal Alignment: A New Alignment Framework via Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08777)
*Yang Cai,Weiqiang Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes universal alignment for LLMs through test-time scaling with multiple candidate responses, characterizes optimal convergence rates, shows limitations of existing methods like NLHF, and proposes symmetric multi-player alignment games that achieve optimal scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs to serve users with heterogeneous and potentially conflicting preferences is challenging. Existing alignment methods often collapse to single majority-preferred responses, making test-time scaling ineffective. The paper aims to develop methods that properly utilize test-time scaling for universal alignment.

Method: Introduces (k,f(k))-robust alignment and asymptotic universal alignment (U-alignment). Proposes symmetric multi-player alignment games where any symmetric Nash equilibrium policy of the (k+1)-player game achieves optimal (k,k/(k+1))-robust alignment. Provides theoretical convergence guarantees for self-play learning dynamics.

Result: Characterizes optimal convergence rate: k/(k+1) is optimal and cannot be improved. Shows NLHF and other post-training methods underutilize test-time scaling, often achieving win rates barely above 1/2. The proposed symmetric multi-player alignment games achieve optimal test-time scaling rate.

Conclusion: Test-time scaling with multiple candidate responses enables universal alignment, but existing methods fail to leverage it due to lack of output diversity. The proposed symmetric multi-player alignment framework achieves optimal scaling rates and provides theoretical guarantees for learning dynamics.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to serve users with heterogeneous and potentially conflicting preferences is a central challenge for personalized and trustworthy AI. We formalize an ideal notion of universal alignment through test-time scaling: for each prompt, the model produces $k\ge 1$ candidate responses and a user selects their preferred one. We introduce $(k,f(k))$-robust alignment, which requires the $k$-output model to have win rate $f(k)$ against any other single-output model, and asymptotic universal alignment (U-alignment), which requires $f(k)\to 1$ as $k\to\infty$. Our main result characterizes the optimal convergence rate: there exists a family of single-output policies whose $k$-sample product policies achieve U-alignment at rate $f(k)=\frac{k}{k+1}$, and no method can achieve a faster rate in general.
  We show that popular post-training methods, including Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), can fundamentally underutilize the benefits of test-time scaling. Even though NLHF is optimal for $k=1$, sampling from the resulting (often deterministic) policy cannot guarantee win rates above $\tfrac{1}{2}$ except for an arbitrarily small slack. This stems from a lack of output diversity: existing alignment methods can collapse to a single majority-preferred response, making additional samples redundant. In contrast, our approach preserves output diversity and achieves the optimal test-time scaling rate. In particular, we propose a family of symmetric multi-player alignment games and prove that any symmetric Nash equilibrium policy of the $(k+1)$-player alignment game achieves the optimal $(k,\frac{k}{k+1})$-robust alignment. Finally, we provide theoretical convergence guarantees for self-play learning dynamics in these games and extend the framework to opponents that also generate multiple responses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLASSIX algorithm extended to support multiple distance metrics (Manhattan, Tanimoto) with improved performance and quality compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend the fast and explainable CLASSIX clustering algorithm to work with different distance metrics beyond Euclidean distance, enabling broader applicability to various data types and domains.

Method: Replace principal component sorting with appropriate norm-based sorting for different distance metrics, use triangle inequality for search termination, and apply a sharper intersection inequality specifically for Tanimoto distance to boost performance.

Result: CLASSIX with Tanimoto distance achieves ~30x speedup over Taylor-Butina and ~80x speedup over DBSCAN on chemical fingerprint data, while producing higher-quality clusters.

Conclusion: The extended CLASSIX algorithm successfully supports multiple distance metrics with significant performance improvements and better clustering quality compared to existing methods, particularly excelling with Tanimoto distance on chemical data.

Abstract: The CLASSIX algorithm is a fast and explainable approach to data clustering. In its original form, this algorithm exploits the sorting of the data points by their first principal component to truncate the search for nearby data points, with nearness being defined in terms of the Euclidean distance. Here we extend CLASSIX to other distance metrics, including the Manhattan distance and the Tanimoto distance. Instead of principal components, we use an appropriate norm of the data vectors as the sorting criterion, combined with the triangle inequality for search termination. In the case of Tanimoto distance, a provably sharper intersection inequality is used to further boost the performance of the new algorithm. On a real-world chemical fingerprint benchmark, CLASSIX Tanimoto is about 30 times faster than the Taylor--Butina algorithm, and about 80 times faster than DBSCAN, while computing higher-quality clusters in both cases.

*Boaz Moav,Ryan Gabrys,Eitan Yaakobi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis of DNA strand synthesis under spatial constraints, focusing on two strands per row with row-constrained synthesis cycles. Derives bounds on expected completion time and analyzes different scheduling policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by large-scale DNA synthesis technologies where strands are arranged in arrays and synthesized under spatial constraints (at most one strand per row per cycle). Need to understand theoretical limits of synthesis time under such constraints.

Method: Decomposes synthesis process into Markov chain for analysis. Studies different scheduling policies: laggard-first policy, policies with look-ahead, and optimal offline scheduling using dynamic programming. Focuses on basic case of two strands in a single row.

Result: Laggard-first policy achieves asymptotic expected completion time of (q+3)L/2 for alphabet size q, and no online policy without look-ahead can beat this. With single-symbol look-ahead in binary case, time improves to 7L/3. Dynamic programming computes optimal offline schedule.

Conclusion: First analytical bounds for DNA synthesis under spatial constraints. Provides groundwork for future studies of optimal synthesis policies in constrained settings, showing trade-offs between policy complexity and synthesis efficiency.

Abstract: We study the theoretical problem of synthesizing multiple DNA strands under spatial constraints, motivated by large-scale DNA synthesis technologies. In this setting, strands are arranged in an array and synthesized according to a fixed global synthesis sequence, with the restriction that at most one strand per row may be synthesized in any synthesis cycle. We focus on the basic case of two strands in a single row and analyze the expected completion time under this row-constrained model. By decomposing the process into a Markov chain, we derive analytical upper and lower bounds on the expected synthesis time. We show that a simple laggard-first policy achieves an asymptotic expected completion time of (q+3)L/2 for any alphabet of size q, and that no online policy without look-ahead can asymptotically outperform this bound. For the binary case, we show that allowing a single-symbol look-ahead strictly improves performance, yielding an asymptotic expected completion time of 7L/3. Finally, we present a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the optimal offline schedule for any fixed pair of sequences. Together, these results provide the first analytical bounds for synthesis under spatial constraints and lay the groundwork for future studies of optimal synthesis policies in such settings.

### [253] [Distributed Detection under Stringent Resource Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07989)
*Abdelaziz Bounhar,Mireille Sarkiss,Michèle Wigger*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Stein-exponents for distributed detection under three communication constraints with DMCs, revealing a dichotomy: partially-connected DMCs match zero-rate noiseless link exponents, while fully-connected DMCs often render sensors useless.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how communication constraints affect distributed detection performance, specifically when sensors communicate over DMCs with limited channel uses or input cost constraints, and to identify fundamental limits on error exponents.

Method: Analyzes three scenarios: 1) sublinear channel uses in n, 2) n channel uses with almost sure sublinear block-input cost, 3) expectation-based block-input constraints. Adapts Han's zero-rate coding for partially-connected DMCs and develops new converse proofs using change of measure arguments.

Result: Dichotomy emerges: For partially-connected DMCs, Stein-exponent matches zero-rate noiseless link exponent. For fully-connected DMCs in scenarios 1-2, exponent collapses to local test performance (sensor useless). In scenario 3, sensor remains beneficial but exponent collapses compared to partially-connected case, with better performance when constraint applies only under null hypothesis.

Conclusion: Channel structure (partial vs full connectivity) critically determines distributed detection performance under communication constraints. Partially-connected DMCs preserve zero-rate benefits, while fully-connected DMCs often negate sensor advantages except under expectation constraints, highlighting fundamental tradeoffs between communication resources and detection performance.

Abstract: This paper identifies the Stein-exponent of distributed detection when the sensor communicates to the decision center over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) subject to one of three stringent communication constraints: 1) The number of channel uses of the DMC grows sublinearly in the number of source observations n; 2) The number of channel uses is n but a block-input cost constraint is imposed almost surely, which grows sublinearly in n; 3) The block-input constraint is imposed only on expectation. We identify a dichotomy in the Stein-exponent of all these setups depending on the structure of the DMC's transition law. Under any of these three constraints, when the DMC is partially-connected (i.e., some outputs cannot be induced by certain inputs) the Stein-exponent matches the exponent identified by Han and Kobayashi and by Shalaby and Papamarcou for the scenario where communication is of zero-rate but over a noiseless link. We prove our result by adapting Han's zero-rate coding strategy to partially-connected DMCs.
  In contrast, for fully-connected DMCs, in our scenarios 1) and 2) the Stein-exponent collapses to that of a local test at the decision center, rendering the remote sensor and communication useless. %To prove this result, we propose new converse proofs relying on change of measure arguments.
  In scenario 3), the sensor remains beneficial even for fully-connected DMCs, however also collapses compared to the case of a partially-connected DMC. Moreover, the Stein-exponent is larger when the expectation constraint is imposed only under the null hypothesis compared to when it is imposed under both hypotheses. To prove these results, we propose both new coding strategies and new converse proofs.

### [254] [The many faces of multivariate information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08030)
*Thomas F. Varley*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generalized function Δ^k that unifies three existing higher-order information measures (dual total correlation, S-information, and O-information) as special cases, revealing a hierarchy of synergistic interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the diverse set of statistics developed for analyzing higher-order structures in multivariate data and provide a coherent framework for understanding multipartite interactions in complex systems.

Method: Developed a generalized function Δ^k parameterized by a free parameter k, showing that existing measures are special cases: Δ⁰ = S-information, Δ¹ = dual total correlation, Δ² = -O-information. Also derived the conjugate function Γ^k for redundancy analysis using entropic conjugation framework.

Result: Δ^k reveals a hierarchy of increasingly high-order synergies: positive values indicate dominance of interactions with order > k, negative values indicate dominance of interactions with order < k, and zero indicates pure k-order synergies. The conjugate Γ^k similarly organizes redundancies.

Conclusion: The Δ^k framework unifies multiple higher-order information measures, provides new insights into redundant and synergistic interactions, and organizes the existing "zoo" of measures into a coherent hierarchical structure.

Abstract: Extracting higher-order structures from multivariate data has become an area of intensive study in complex systems science, as these multipartite interactions can reveal insights into fundamental features of complex systems like emergent phenomena. Information theory provides a natural language for exploring these interactions, as it elegantly formalizes the problem of comparing ``wholes" and ``parts" using joint, conditional, and marginal entropies. A large number of distinct statistics have been developed over the years, all aiming to capture different aspects of ``higher-order" information sharing. Here, we show that three of them (the dual total correlation, S-information, and O-information) are special cases of a more general function, $Δ^{k}$ which is parameterized by a free parameter $k$. For different values of $k$, we recover different measures: $Δ^{0}$ is equal to the S-information, $Δ^{1}$ is equal to the dual total correlation, and $Δ^{2}$ is equal to the negative O-information. Generally, the $Δ^{k}$ function is arranged into a hierarchy of increasingly high-order synergies; for a given value of $k$, if $Δ^{k}>0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order greater than $k$, while if $Δ^{k}<0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order lower than $k$. $Δ^{k}=0$ if the system is composed entirely of synergies of order-k. Using the entropic conjugation framework, we also find that the conjugate of $Δ^{k}$, which we term $Γ^{k}$ is arranged into a similar hierarchy of increasingly high-order redundancies. These results provide new insights into the nature of both higher-order redundant and synergistic interactions, and helps unify the existing zoo of measures into a more coherent structure.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified construction of cyclic orbit flag codes that yields two families of flag codes with optimal distance properties and specific cardinalities, advancing the theory of flag codes as generalizations of constant dimension codes.

Abstract: Flag codes generalize constant dimension codes by considering sequences of nested subspaces with prescribed dimensions as codewords.

TL;DR: Future cellular systems need smarter antenna arrays, not just more antennas. Non-uniform sparse arrays with site-specific placements can achieve better performance with fewer antennas than traditional massive MIMO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current massive MIMO systems use hundreds of antennas per base station, leading to concerns about hardware complexity, cost, and power consumption. There's a need for more intelligent array designs that reduce excessive antenna numbers while maintaining or improving performance.

Method: Proposes non-uniform sparse arrays with site-specific antenna placements, using either pre-optimized irregular arrays or real-time movable antennas. These designs exploit spatial sampling principles inspired by wireless localization to reduce redundancies in practical deployment scenarios.

Result: Demonstrates numerically that these intelligent array designs can achieve superior multiuser MIMO performance with far fewer antennas, improving average sum rate and similar metrics compared to traditional uniform arrays.

Conclusion: Suggests a paradigm shift where antenna intelligence replaces sheer antenna count, opening opportunities for efficient, adaptable, and sustainable Gigantic MIMO systems through smarter array design rather than simply adding more antennas.

Abstract: Current cellular systems achieve high spectral efficiency through Massive MIMO, which leverages an abundance of antennas to create favorable propagation conditions for multiuser spatial multiplexing. Looking towards future networks, the extrapolation of this paradigm leads to systems with many hundreds of antennas per base station, raising concerns regarding hardware complexity, cost, and power consumption. This article suggests more intelligent array designs that reduce the need for excessive antenna numbers. We revisit classical uniform array design principles and explain how their uniform spatial sampling leads to unnecessary redundancies in practical deployment scenarios. By exploiting non-uniform sparse arrays with site-specific antenna placements -- based on either pre-optimized irregular arrays or real-time movable antennas -- we demonstrate how superior multiuser MIMO performance can be achieved with far fewer antennas. These principles are inspired by previous works on wireless localization. We explain and demonstrate numerically how these concepts can be adapted for communications to improve the average sum rate and similar metrics. The results suggest a paradigm shift for future antenna array design, where antenna intelligence replaces sheer antenna count. This opens new opportunities for efficient, adaptable, and sustainable Gigantic MIMO systems.

TL;DR: A multi-stage framework for broadband near-field ISAC using movable antennas, featuring subregion division, NOMP-based angle estimation, LSRC for scatterer localization, and refined channel estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Movable antennas enable near-field wireless channels, offering new performance opportunities for integrated sensing and communication that need to be effectively exploited.

Method: Multi-stage framework: 1) Divide MA movement area into subregions, 2) Use NOMP algorithm for high-precision angle estimation in each subregion, 3) Apply LSRC method to identify scatterer positions by jointly processing angle estimates across subregions, 4) Refine near-field channel estimation using estimated scatterer locations.

Result: Simulation results show significant enhancement in MA sensing accuracy and channel estimation performance, providing an efficient solution for MA-aided near-field ISAC.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-stage framework effectively leverages MA capabilities for near-field ISAC, improving both sensing and communication performance through coordinated subregion processing and scatterer localization.

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) introduces a new degree of freedom for future wireless communication systems by enabling the adaptive adjustment of antenna positions. Its large-range movement renders wireless channels transmission into the near-field region, which brings new performance enhancement for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). This paper proposes a novel multi-stage design framework for broadband near-field ISAC assisted by MA. The framework first divides the MA movement area into multiple subregions, and employs the Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm (NOMP) to achieve high-precision angle estimation in each subregion. Subsequently, a method called near-field localization via subregion ray clustering (LSRC) is proposed for identifying the positions of scatterers. This method finds the coordinates of each scatterer by jointly processing the angle estimates across all subregions. Finally, according to the estimated locations of the scatterers, the near-field channel estimation (CE) is refined for improving communication performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance MA sensing accuracy and CE, providing an efficient solution for MA-aided near-field ISAC.

TL;DR: The paper develops improved information-theoretic generalization bounds for stochastic learning algorithms, with special focus on differentially private algorithms, using typicality arguments and stability properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To derive sharper generalization error bounds for stochastic learning algorithms from an information-theoretic perspective, particularly for differentially private algorithms where existing bounds can be improved.

Method: Uses information-theoretic measures (mutual information and maximal leakage) with typicality-based arguments and exploits stability properties of private algorithms to derive explicit, easily computable bounds.

Result: 1) Strict improvement over existing mutual information bounds by Rodríguez-Gálvez et al. 2) New upper bounds on maximal leakage of learning algorithms. Both translate directly into generalization error guarantees.

Conclusion: The work provides sharper, computable information-theoretic generalization bounds for stochastic learning algorithms, with particular improvements for differentially private algorithms through stability-based arguments.

Abstract: We study the generalization error of stochastic learning algorithms from an information-theoretic perspective, with a particular emphasis on deriving sharper bounds for differentially private algorithms. It is well known that the generalization error of stochastic learning algorithms can be bounded in terms of mutual information and maximal leakage, yielding in-expectation and high-probability guarantees, respectively. In this work, we further upper bound mutual information and maximal leakage by explicit, easily computable formulas, using typicality-based arguments and exploiting the stability properties of private algorithms. In the first part of the paper, we strictly improve the mutual-information bounds by Rodríguez-Gálvez et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2021). In the second part, we derive new upper bounds on the maximal leakage of learning algorithms. In both cases, the resulting bounds on information measures translate directly into generalization error guarantees.

### [259] [An Efficient Algorithm to Sample Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08387)
*Paolo Santini*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Efficient combinatorial algorithm for sampling random sparse matrices for quantum LDPC codes using Information Set Decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing constructions for quantum LDPC codes are algebraic and impose specific properties (like quasi-cyclic structure), limiting randomness. Need a more general, combinatorial approach to sample sparse self-orthogonal matrices that are as random as possible.

Method: Purely combinatorial algorithm using Information Set Decoding (ISD) to sample rows of sparse matrix H one at a time, ensuring H·H^⊤ = 0. Algorithm can be generalized to non-binary fields and general quantum stabilizer LDPC codes.

Result: Theoretical characterization of parameter ranges and computational complexity. Numerical simulations confirm feasibility and efficiency of the approach.

Conclusion: ISD-based combinatorial algorithm enables efficient sampling of random sparse matrices for quantum LDPC codes, overcoming limitations of algebraic constructions and providing more general, random code structures.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to sample random sparse matrices to be used as check matrices for quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. To ease the treatment, we mainly describe our algorithm as a technique to sample a dual-containing binary LDPC code, hence, a sparse matrix $\mathbf H\in\mathbb F_2^{r\times n}$ such that $\mathbf H\mathbf H^\top = \mathbf 0$. However, as we show, the algorithm can be easily generalized to sample dual-containing LDPC codes over non binary finite fields as well as more general quantum stabilizer LDPC codes.
  While several constructions already exist, all of them are somewhat algebraic as they impose some specific property (e.g., the matrix being quasi-cyclic). Instead, our algorithm is purely combinatorial as we do not require anything apart from the rows of $\mathbf H$ being sparse enough. In this sense, we can think of our algorithm as a way to sample sparse, self-orthogonal matrices that are as random as possible.
  Our algorithm is conceptually very simple and, as a key ingredient, uses Information Set Decoding (ISD) to sample the rows of $\mathbf H$, one at a time. The use of ISD is fundamental as, without it, efficient sampling would not be feasible. We give a theoretical characterization of our algorithm, determining which ranges of parameters can be sampled as well as the expected computational complexity. Numerical simulations and benchmarks confirm the feasibility and efficiency of our approach.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Novel distribution estimation with semantic side information from word embeddings improves accuracy for large alphabets like text corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional discrete distribution estimation doesn't leverage semantic side information available in large alphabet datasets like text corpora, where word embeddings provide similarity information that could improve estimation accuracy.

Method: Two models incorporating side information: (1) local model where unknown distribution is near a known distribution, and (2) partial ordering model with alphabet partitioned into known higher/lower probability sets. Theoretical analysis of squared-error risk improvement.

Result: Theoretical characterization shows improvement in squared-error risk due to side information. Simulations on natural language and synthetic data demonstrate practical gains.

Conclusion: Semantic side information from word embeddings can significantly improve discrete distribution estimation for large alphabets, with theoretical guarantees and practical benefits demonstrated across different models.

Abstract: We consider the classical problem of discrete distribution estimation using i.i.d. samples in a novel scenario where additional side information is available on the distribution. In large alphabet datasets such as text corpora, such side information arises naturally through word semantics/similarities that can be inferred by closeness of vector word embeddings, for instance. We consider two specific models for side information--a local model where the unknown distribution is in the neighborhood of a known distribution, and a partial ordering model where the alphabet is partitioned into known higher and lower probability sets. In both models, we theoretically characterize the improvement in a suitable squared-error risk because of the available side information. Simulations over natural language and synthetic data illustrate these gains.

Result: New boundary points on capacity region for certain classes of more capable broadcast channels with uni-directional cooperation; evaluated for Gaussian BCs and mixed BEC-BSC channels.

Conclusion: The proposed superposition coding with decode-and-forward scheme achieves new boundary points, demonstrating improved capacity regions for broadcast channels with receiver cooperation.

Abstract: This article characterizes new boundary points on the capacity region of certain classes of more capable broadcast channels (BC) with uni-directional cooperation from the stronger to the weaker receiver. The new boundary points are achieved by a simple coding scheme that employs superposition coding at the transmitter with decode and forward at the stronger receiver. We evaluate our general result for Gaussian BCs and for a BC consisting of a binary erasure channel (BEC) to the stronger receiver and a binary symmetric channel (BSC) to the weaker receiver.

Result: Construction produces QLDPC codes where unavoidable length-4 cycles are assembled in single variable node, allowing mitigation of their detrimental effects through decimation of that node.

Conclusion: Algebraic dyadic matrix construction provides practical method for designing QLDPC codes compatible with modern decoders, addressing cycle issues in Tanner graphs for improved quantum error correction.

Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes provide a practical balance between error-correction capability and implementation complexity in quantum error correction (QEC). In this paper, we propose an algebraic construction based on dyadic matrices for designing both classical and quantum LDPC codes. The method first generates classical binary quasi-dyadic LDPC codes whose Tanner graphs have girth 6. It is then extended to the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) framework, where the two component parity-check matrices are built to satisfy the compatibility condition required by the recently introduced CAMEL-ensemble quaternary belief propagation decoder. This compatibility condition ensures that all unavoidable cycles of length 4 are assembled in a single variable node, allowing the mitigation of their detrimental effects by decimating that variable node.

### [263] [Multivariate Polynomial Codes for Efficient Matrix Chain Multiplication in Distributed Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08708)
*Jesús Gómez-Vilardebò*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes two multivariate polynomial coding schemes for distributed matrix chain multiplication that reduce storage overhead compared to univariate approaches, revealing a computation-storage trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed computing clusters face the straggler problem where slow workers dominate latency. Existing coded computing strategies focus on two-matrix multiplication but have high computational complexity and storage costs. Real-world applications often involve long chains of matrix multiplications, and extending univariate polynomial coding to this setting amplifies costs significantly.

Method: Two novel multivariate polynomial coding schemes specifically designed for matrix chain multiplication in distributed environments. These schemes use multivariate polynomials rather than univariate polynomials to encode the computation.

Result: Multivariate codes introduce additional computational cost at workers but dramatically reduce storage overhead compared to univariate extensions. This reveals a fundamental trade-off between computation and storage efficiency.

Conclusion: Multivariate polynomial codes show potential as a practical solution for large-scale distributed linear algebra tasks by offering a favorable trade-off between computation and storage costs for matrix chain multiplication.

Abstract: We study the problem of computing matrix chain multiplications in a distributed computing cluster. In such systems, performance is often limited by the straggler problem, where the slowest worker dominates the overall computation latency. To resolve this issue, several coded computing strategies have been proposed, primarily focusing on the simplest case: the multiplication of two matrices. These approaches successfully alleviate the straggler effect, but they do so at the expense of higher computational complexity and increased storage needs at the workers. However, in many real-world applications, computations naturally involve long chains of matrix multiplications rather than just a single two-matrix product. Extending univariate polynomial coding to this setting has been shown to amplify the costs -- both computation and storage overheads grow significantly, limiting scalability. In this work, we propose two novel multivariate polynomial coding schemes specifically designed for matrix chain multiplication in distributed environments. Our results show that while multivariate codes introduce additional computational cost at the workers, they can dramatically reduce storage overhead compared to univariate extensions. This reveals a fundamental trade-off between computation and storage efficiency, and highlights the potential of multivariate codes as a practical solution for large-scale distributed linear algebra tasks.

### [264] [On the Algebraic Structure Underlying the Support Enumerators of Linear Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08744)
*Nitin Kenjale,Anuradha S. Garge*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces support distribution and support enumerator as refinements of weight distribution/enumerator to capture coordinate-level activity in linear block codes, establishes formulas for counting codewords with nonzero i-th coordinate, derives a MacWilliams-type identity for support enumerators between a code and its dual, and obtains self-duality conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a more detailed understanding of code structure by capturing coordinate-level activity, which complements classical weight-based duality theory. The classical weight distribution/enumerator approach doesn't reveal information about specific coordinate positions.

Method: Introduces support distribution and support enumerator concepts for linear block codes. Develops formulas to count codewords whose i-th coordinate is nonzero. Derives a MacWilliams-type identity relating normalized support enumerators of a linear code and its dual.

Result: Established formulas for coordinate-level codeword counting, derived a support enumerator duality identity, and deduced conditions for self-duality based on equality of support distributions.

Conclusion: These results provide refined tools for analyzing linear codes at the coordinate level, complementing classical weight-based theory and offering deeper insights into code structure and duality relationships.

Abstract: In this paper, we have introduced the concepts of support distribution and the support enumerator as refinements of the classical weight distribution and weight enumerator respectively, capturing coordinate level activity in linear block codes. More precisely, we have established formula for counting codewords in the linear code C whose i-th coordinate is nonzero. Moreover, we derived a MacWilliam's type identity, relating the normalized support enumerators of a linear code and its dual, explaining how coordinate information transforms under duality. Using this identity we deduce a condition for self duality based on the equality of support distributions. These results provide a more detailed understanding of code structure and complement classical weight based duality theory.

*Hoang Ly,Emina Soljanin,Philip Whiting*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the error-correction performance of binary linear locally repairable codes (LRCs) under majority-logic decoding, deriving explicit bounds on decoding failure probability over BEC and BSC channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LRCs have been extensively studied for their structural properties and worst-case guarantees, their performance under random erasures and errors has remained largely unexplored. The paper aims to bridge this gap by analyzing typical performance under stochastic channel models.

Method: The study focuses on binary linear LRCs with fixed locality and varying availability, using majority-logic decoding (MLD). The authors derive explicit upper bounds on the probability of decoding failure over memoryless Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC).

Result: The analysis characterizes bit-error rate (BER) and block-error rate (BLER) as functions of locality and availability parameters. Under mild growth conditions on availability, the block decoding failure probability vanishes asymptotically, and majority-logic decoding can successfully correct virtually all error and erasure patterns of weight linear in the blocklength.

Conclusion: The results reveal a substantial gap between worst-case guarantees and typical performance under stochastic channel models, showing that LRCs with majority-logic decoding perform much better in practice than worst-case analysis would suggest.

Abstract: Locally repairable codes (LRCs) were originally introduced to enable efficient recovery from erasures in distributed storage systems by accessing only a small number of other symbols. While their structural properties-such as bounds and constructions-have been extensively studied, the performance of LRCs under random erasures and errors has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study the error- and erasure-correction performance of binary linear LRCs under majority-logic decoding (MLD). Focusing on LRCs with fixed locality and varying availability, we derive explicit upper bounds on the probability of decoding failure over the memoryless Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). Our analysis characterizes the behavior of the bit-error rate (BER) and block-error rate (BLER) as functions of the locality and availability parameters. We show that, under mild growth conditions on the availability, the block decoding failure probability vanishes asymptotically, and that majority-logic decoding can successfully correct virtually all of error and erasure patterns of weight linear in the blocklength. The results reveal a substantial gap between worst-case guarantees and typical performance under stochastic channel models.

Conclusion: LWM-Spectro provides a unified foundation for wireless learning that effectively transfers to downstream tasks with minimal supervision, addressing key challenges in wireless signal analysis.

Abstract: The received in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) baseband signals inherently encode physical-layer and channel characteristics of wireless links. Learning robust and transferable representations directly from such raw signals, however, remains challenging due to heterogeneous communication systems, diverse propagation environments, and limited labeled data. To address this, we present LWM-Spectro, a transformer-based foundation model pretrained on large-scale I/Q data represented as time-frequency spectrograms. The model leverages self-supervised masked modeling, contrastive learning, and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to learn general-purpose wireless representations. These representations transfer effectively to downstream tasks such as modulation classification and joint SNR/mobility recognition, even with minimal supervision. Across tasks, LWM-Spectro consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning baselines in both few-shot and data-rich regimes, providing a unified foundation for wireless learning.

### [267] [Modal Parameter Extraction via Propeller-Driven Vibration Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08123)
*Gabriele Dessena,Alessandro Pontillo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: PVT (Propeller-driven Vibration Testing) is evaluated as an output-only alternative to traditional GVT, using propeller excitation on a wing spar to extract modal parameters with promising results for low-frequency modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Ground Vibration Testing (GVT) for aircraft certification is lengthy and costly. The paper explores Propeller-driven Vibration Testing (PVT) as a more efficient, output-only alternative that aligns with Operational Modal Analysis approaches like Taxi Vibration Testing and Flight Vibration Testing.

Method: A cantilever Aluminium 7075-T6 wing spar was instrumented with seven accelerometers and excited by an outboard electric motor and propeller. Seven test runs were conducted: a motor-off baseline, five constant-throttle cases, and a manual throttle sweep. Modal parameters were identified using the Natural Excitation Technique with the Loewner Framework (NExT-LF).

Result: Dominant resonances remained observable under propeller excitation, though low-throttle conditions introduced narrowband harmonics that could mask structural peaks. The first two modes showed excellent repeatability (MAC > 0.99), while the third mode had reduced repeatability (MAC = 0.827) and larger frequency shift, attributed to propeller-induced bending-torsion coupling and non-ideal sweep control.

Conclusion: PVT provides a viable complement to GVT for extracting low-frequency modal information. Future work should focus on automated throttle scheduling and coupling-aware test planning to improve reliability and overcome current limitations.

Abstract: Ground Vibration Testing (GVT) supports aircraft certification but often requires lengthy and costly campaigns. Propeller-driven Vibration Testing (PVT) is assessed here as an output-only alternative, in line with Operational Modal Analysis approaches such as Taxi Vibration Testing and Flight Vibration Testing. A cantilever Aluminium 7075-T6 wing spar is instrumented with seven accelerometers and excited by an outboard electric motor and propeller. Seven runs are carried out: a motor-off baseline, five constant-throttle cases, and a manual up-down throttle sweep. The acquired spectra indicate that the dominant resonances remain observable under propeller excitation, while low-throttle conditions introduce narrowband harmonics that may mask structural peaks; the sweep reduces persistent overlap. Modal parameters are identified for the baseline and sweep cases using the Natural Excitation Technique with the Loewner Framework (NExT-LF). The first two modes remain closely matched (Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) > 0.99), whereas the third mode shows reduced repeatability (MAC = 0.827) and a larger frequency shift, consistent with propeller-induced bending--torsion coupling and non-ideal sweep control. Overall, PVT provides a viable complement to GVT for extracting low-frequency modal information and motivates pursuing future work on automated throttle scheduling and coupling-aware test planning.

### [268] [Variable-Length Wideband CSI Feedback via Loewner Interpolation and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08300)
*Meilin Li,Wei Xu,Zhixiang Hu,An Liu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Variable-length CSI feedback scheme for FDD massive MIMO in U6G band using Loewner Interpolation and neural networks with adaptive quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CS/DL-based CSI feedback schemes suffer from energy leakage in DFT basis when applied to wideband U6G channels, limiting recovery accuracy.

Method: 1) Loewner Interpolation framework generates dynamic bases for frequency-domain compression; 2) Neural network further compresses in spatial domain; 3) Rateless auto-encoder with tail dropout and multi-objective learning for variable-length feedback; 4) Codeword importance ranking; 5) Adaptive quantization strategy.

Result: Achieves higher CSI feedback accuracy with less/equal overhead, improves spectral efficiency compared to baseline schemes.

Conclusion: Proposed scheme effectively addresses energy leakage in wideband U6G channels, enables flexible feedback overhead-accuracy tradeoff, and maintains robust performance under limited feedback.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a variable-length wideband channel state information (CSI) feedback scheme for Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) systems in U6G band (6425MHz-7125MHz). Existing compressive sensing (CS)-based and deep learning (DL)- based schemes preprocess the channel by truncating it in the angular-delay domain. However, the energy leakage effect caused by the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) basis will be more serious and leads to a bottleneck in recovery accuracy when applied to wideband channels such as those in U6G. To solve this problem, we introduce the Loewner Interpolation (LI) framework which generates a set of dynamic bases based on the current CSI matrix, enabling highly efficient compression in the frequency domain. Then, the LI basis is further compressed in the spatial domain through a neural network. To achieve a flexible trade-off between feedback overhead and recovery accuracy, we design a rateless auto-encoder trained with tail dropout and a multi-objective learning schedule, supporting variable-length feedback with a singular model. Meanwhile, the codewords are ranked by importance, ensuring that the base station (BS) can still maintain acceptable reconstruction performance under limited feedback with tail erasures. Furthermore, an adaptive quantization strategy is developed for the feedback framework to enhance robustness. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme could achieve higher CSI feedback accuracy with less or equal feedback overhead, and improve spectral efficiency compared with baseline schemes.

Conclusion: Meta-backscatter systems using metamaterial tags offer a promising solution to overcome the critical communication range barrier in battery-free IoT, with established design framework and research roadmap, though key challenges remain for future research.

Abstract: Battery-free Internet of Things (BF-IoT) enabled by backscatter communication is a rapidly evolving technology offering advantages of low cost, ultra-low power consumption, and robustness. However, the practical deployment of BF-IoT is significantly constrained by the limited communication range of common backscatter tags, which typically operate with a range of merely a few meters due to inherent round-trip path loss. Meta-backscatter systems that utilize metamaterial tags present a promising solution, retaining the inherent advantages of BF-IoT while breaking the critical communication range barrier. By leveraging densely paved sub-wavelength units to concentrate the reflected signal power, metamaterial tags enable a significant communication range extension over existing BF-IoT tags that employ omni-directional antennas. In this paper, we synthesize the principles and paradigms of metamaterial sensing to establish a unified design framework and a forward-looking research roadmap. Specifically, we first provide an overview of backscatter communication, encompassing its development history, working principles, and tag classification. We then introduce the design methodology for both metamaterial tags and their compatible transceivers. Moreover, we present the implementation of a meta-backscatter system prototype and report the experimental results based on it. Finally, we conclude by highlighting key challenges and outlining potential avenues for future research.

Abstract: Predicting pathloss by considering the physical environment is crucial for effective wireless network planning. Traditional methods, such as ray tracing and model-based approaches, often face challenges due to high computational complexity and discrepancies between models and real-world environments. In contrast, deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative, offering accurate path loss predictions with reduced computational complexity.

We employ innovative techniques to capture key features of the environment by generating transmission (Tx) and reception (Rx) depth maps, as well as a distance map from the geographic data. Recognizing the significant attenuation caused by signal reflection and diffraction, particularly at high frequencies, we have developed a weighting map that emphasizes the areas adjacent to the direct path between Tx and Rx for path loss prediction. {Extensive simulations demonstrate that our model outperforms PPNet, RPNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT) by 1.2-3.0 dB using dataset of ITU challenge 2024 and ICASSP 2023.

Conclusion: SDP establishes a principled protocol foundation for fair evaluation across diverse sensing tasks and platforms, enabling reproducible and comparable wireless sensing research and supporting the transition from ad hoc experimentation to reliable engineering practice.

Abstract: Learning-based wireless sensing has made rapid progress, yet the field still lacks a unified and reproducible experimental foundation. Unlike computer vision, wireless sensing relies on hardware-dependent channel measurements whose representations, preprocessing pipelines, and evaluation protocols vary significantly across devices and datasets, hindering fair comparison and reproducibility.
  This paper proposes the Sensing Data Protocol (SDP), a protocol-level abstraction and unified benchmark for scalable wireless sensing. SDP acts as a standardization layer that decouples learning tasks from hardware heterogeneity. To this end, SDP enforces deterministic physical-layer sanitization, canonical tensor construction, and standardized training and evaluation procedures, decoupling learning performance from hardware-specific artifacts. Rather than introducing task-specific models, SDP establishes a principled protocol foundation for fair evaluation across diverse sensing tasks and platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDP achieves competitive accuracy while substantially improving stability, reducing inter-seed performance variance by orders of magnitude on complex activity recognition tasks. A real-world experiment using commercial off-the-shelf Wi-Fi hardware further illustrating the protocol's interoperability across heterogeneous hardware. By providing a unified protocol and benchmark, SDP enables reproducible and comparable wireless sensing research and supports the transition from ad hoc experimentation toward reliable engineering practice.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A coordinated drone surveillance scheme using 5G SSB signals where multiple APs collaboratively detect drones through beam sweeping while maintaining communication quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable simultaneous drone surveillance and 5G communication using the same infrastructure, addressing the need for low-altitude drone detection while maintaining reliable user communication.

Method: Multistatic configuration with multiple APs collaboratively illuminating surveillance volume while transmitting SSB signals. Uses beam sweeping with a precoder design that ensures orthogonality between sensing beams and SSB signals to prevent interference.

Result: The proposed precoder outperforms non-coordinated precoders and shows minimal sensitivity to drone altitude variations, effectively balancing sensing SINR maximization with user communication quality.

Conclusion: The scheme successfully integrates drone surveillance with 5G SSB procedures, demonstrating practical feasibility through coordinated beamforming that maintains both sensing performance and communication reliability.

Abstract: This paper introduces a scheme for drone surveillance coordinated with the fifth generation (5G) synchronization signal block (SSB) cell-search procedure to simultaneously detect low-altitude drones within a volumetric surveillance grid. Herein, we consider a multistatic configuration where multiple access points (APs) collaboratively illuminate the volume while independently transmitting SSB broadcast signals. Both tasks are performed through a beam sweeping. In the proposed scheme, coordinated APs send sensing beams toward a grid of voxels within the volumetric surveillance region simultaneously with the 5G SSB burst. To prevent interference between communication and sensing signals, we propose a precoder design that guarantees orthogonality of the sensing beam and the SSB in order to maximize the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) while ensuring a specified SINR for users, as well as minimizing the impact of the direct link. The results demonstrate that the proposed precoder outperforms the non-coordinated precoder and is minimally affected by variations in drone altitude.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing particle communication studies assume constant flow, but real environments like atmospheric winds have time-varying behavior. Need realistic modeling for particle-based communication in complex flow environments.

Method: Model airborne particle communication under time-varying advection as linear time-varying (LTV) channel. Derive closed-form, time-dependent channel impulse response using method of moving frames. Characterize channel through power delay profile and define channel dispersion time as measure of channel memory.

Result: System simulations under directed, time-varying wind conditions show waveform design is critical for performance. Multi-symbol modulation using single particle type is possible when dispersion is sufficiently controlled. Channel dispersion time provides physically meaningful measure for symbol duration selection.

Conclusion: Time-varying diffusion-advection channels can be systematically modeled and engineered using communication theoretic tools, providing realistic foundation for particle-based communication in complex flow environments.

Abstract: Particle based communication using diffusion and advection has emerged as an alternative signaling paradigm recently. While most existing studies assume constant flow conditions, real macro scale environments such as atmospheric winds exhibit time varying behavior. In this work, airborne particle communication under time varying advection is modeled as a linear time varying (LTV) channel, and a closed form, time dependent channel impulse response is derived using the method of moving frames. Based on this formulation, the channel is characterized through its power delay profile, leading to the definition of channel dispersion time as a physically meaningful measure of channel memory and a guideline for symbol duration selection. System level simulations under directed, time varying wind conditions show that waveform design is critical for performance, enabling multi symbol modulation using a single particle type when dispersion is sufficiently controlled. The results demonstrate that time varying diffusion advection channels can be systematically modeled and engineered using communication theoretic tools, providing a realistic foundation for particle based communication in complex flow environments.

TL;DR: RF is a data-independent, computationally efficient dimensionality reduction method that preserves nonlinear manifold structure without training, using randomized filtering to handle massive streaming datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Massive datasets from modern technologies create storage, transmission, and processing challenges. Current methods often require expensive training and may not preserve the underlying geometric structure of data evolving on low-dimensional manifolds.

Method: Randomized Filtering (RF) uses randomized dimensionality reduction to preserve nonlinear manifold structure while remaining data-independent and computationally efficient. It leverages theoretical foundations of randomized dimensionality reduction to create a practical approach.

Result: RF provides provable preservation of manifold structure in embedded space. Experimental verification shows practical benefits across diverse scientific applications including simulated and real-data examples.

Conclusion: RF offers an efficient, training-free solution for dimensionality reduction that preserves essential geometric structure, making it suitable for handling massive streaming datasets in scientific and engineering applications.

Abstract: Many areas in science and engineering now have access to technologies that enable the rapid collection of overwhelming data volumes. While these datasets are vital for understanding phenomena from physical to biological and social systems, the sheer magnitude of the data makes even simple storage, transmission, and basic processing highly challenging. To enable efficient and accurate execution of these data processing tasks, we require new dimensionality reduction tools that 1) do not need expensive, time-consuming training, and 2) preserve the underlying geometry of the data that has the information required to understand the measured system. Specifically, the geometry to be preserved is that induced by the fact that in many applications, streaming high-dimensional data evolves on a low-dimensional attractor manifold. Importantly, we may not know the exact structure of this manifold a priori. To solve these challenges, we present randomized filtering (RF), which leverages a specific instantiation of randomized dimensionality reduction to provably preserve non-linear manifold structure in the embedded space while remaining data-independent and computationally efficient. In this work we build on the rich theoretical promise of randomized dimensionality reduction to develop RF as a real, practical approach. We introduce novel methods, analysis, and experimental verification to illuminate the practicality of RF in diverse scientific applications, including several simulated and real-data examples that showcase the tangible benefits of RF.

Despite rapid advances, existing datasets and pipelines remain fragmented across sensing modalities, hindering fair comparison, transfer, and reproducibility. We propose the Sensing Dataset Protocol (SDP), a protocol-level specification and benchmark framework for large-scale wireless sensing. SDP defines how heterogeneous wireless signals are mapped into a unified perception data-block schema through lightweight synchronization, frequency-time alignment, and resampling, while a Canonical Polyadic-Alternating Least Squares (CP-ALS) pooling stage provides a task-agnostic representation that preserves multipath, spectral, and temporal structures. Built upon this protocol, a unified benchmark is established for detection, recognition, and vital-sign estimation with consistent preprocessing, training, and evaluation. Experiments under the cross-user split demonstrate that SDP significantly reduces variance (approximately 88%) across seeds while maintaining competitive accuracy and latency, confirming its value as a reproducible foundation for multi-modal and multitask sensing research.

### [277] [Application of Ideal Observer for Thresholded Data in Search Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07976)
*Hongwei Lin,Howard C. Gifford*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Developed an anthropomorphic thresholded visual-search model observer that improves task-based image quality assessment by selectively processing high-salience features, enhancing both diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance task-based image quality assessment by creating a more realistic model observer that mimics human visual search behavior, particularly for improving diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging while being computationally efficient.

Method: Two-stage framework: candidate selection using thresholded data to refine regions of interest, followed by decision-making with stage-specific feature processing. The model filters out irrelevant variability by selectively processing high-salience features inspired by human visual system.

Result: Thresholding improves observer performance by excluding low-salience features, especially in noisy environments. Intermediate thresholds often outperform no thresholding. The model can be effectively trained with fewer images while maintaining alignment with human performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework can predict human visual search performance in clinically realistic tasks and provides solutions for model observer training with limited resources. The approach has broader applications in computer vision, machine learning, defense, and security image analysis.

Abstract: This study advances task-based image quality assessment by developing an anthropomorphic thresholded visual-search model observer. The model is an ideal observer for thresholded data inspired by the human visual system, allowing selective processing of high-salience features to improve discrimination performance. By filtering out irrelevant variability, the model enhances diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency.
  The observer employs a two-stage framework: candidate selection and decision-making. Using thresholded data during candidate selection refines regions of interest, while stage-specific feature processing optimizes performance. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of thresholding on feature maps, candidate localization, and multi-feature scenarios. Results demonstrate that thresholding improves observer performance by excluding low-salience features, particularly in noisy environments. Intermediate thresholds often outperform no thresholding, indicating that retaining only relevant features is more effective than keeping all features.
  Additionally, the model demonstrates effective training with fewer images while maintaining alignment with human performance. These findings suggest that the proposed novel framework can predict human visual search performance in clinically realistic tasks and provide solutions for model observer training with limited resources. Our novel approach has applications in other areas where human visual search and detection tasks are modeled such as in computer vision, machine learning, defense and security image analysis.

### [279] [Region of interest detection for efficient aortic segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08683)
*Loris Giordano,Ine Dirks,Tom Lenaerts,Jef Vandemeulebroucke*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel cascade approach for efficient aortic segmentation using targeted ROI detection that achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thoracic aortic dissection and aneurysms are highly lethal, but accurate medical image analysis is challenging. Current deep-learning segmentation models have limitations in difficult cases and high computational costs, hindering clinical adoption.

Method: Proposes a cascade model with: 1) A simple, efficient detection model for single ROI detection using multi-task learning (encoder-decoder for segmentation + fully connected network for detection), 2) Targeted segmentation of detected ROI rather than whole image.

Result: Achieves mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.944 with over 0.9 for all cases, using only one-third of the computing power compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed cascade approach provides state-of-the-art performance while being compact and robust, making it ideal for clinical applications by addressing both accuracy and computational efficiency challenges.

Abstract: Thoracic aortic dissection and aneurysms are the most lethal diseases of the aorta. The major hindrance to treatment lies in the accurate analysis of the medical images. More particularly, aortic segmentation of the 3D image is often tedious and difficult. Deep-learning-based segmentation models are an ideal solution, but their inability to deliver usable outputs in difficult cases and their computational cost cause their clinical adoption to stay limited. This study presents an innovative approach for efficient aortic segmentation using targeted region of interest (ROI) detection. In contrast to classical detection models, we propose a simple and efficient detection model that can be widely applied to detect a single ROI. Our detection model is trained as a multi-task model, using an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation and a fully connected network attached to the bottleneck for detection. We compare the performance of a one-step segmentation model applied to a complete image, nnU-Net and our cascade model composed of a detection and a segmentation step. We achieve a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.944 with over 0.9 for all cases using a third of the computing power. This simple solution achieves state-of-the-art performance while being compact and robust, making it an ideal solution for clinical applications.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: M3CoTBench is a new benchmark for evaluating Chain-of-Thought reasoning in medical multimodal LLMs, addressing the lack of reasoning path evaluation in current medical image understanding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image understanding benchmarks focus only on final answers without evaluating reasoning paths, creating opaque AI systems that lack reliable judgment bases and cannot effectively assist doctors in diagnosis.

Method: Created M3CoTBench benchmark with: 1) diverse multi-level difficulty dataset covering 24 examination types, 2) 13 varying-difficulty tasks, 3) CoT-specific evaluation metrics (correctness, efficiency, impact, consistency) tailored to clinical reasoning, and 4) performance analysis of multiple MLLMs.

Result: The benchmark systematically evaluates CoT reasoning across diverse medical imaging tasks, revealing current limitations of MLLMs in generating reliable and clinically interpretable reasoning.

Conclusion: M3CoTBench aims to foster development of transparent, trustworthy, and diagnostically accurate AI systems for healthcare by addressing the gap in evaluating reasoning processes in medical image understanding.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has proven effective in enhancing large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning, and recent advances have extended this paradigm to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In the medical domain, where diagnostic decisions depend on nuanced visual cues and sequential reasoning, CoT aligns naturally with clinical thinking processes. However, Current benchmarks for medical image understanding generally focus on the final answer while ignoring the reasoning path. An opaque process lacks reliable bases for judgment, making it difficult to assist doctors in diagnosis. To address this gap, we introduce a new M3CoTBench benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency of CoT reasoning in medical image understanding. M3CoTBench features 1) a diverse, multi-level difficulty dataset covering 24 examination types, 2) 13 varying-difficulty tasks, 3) a suite of CoT-specific evaluation metrics (correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency) tailored to clinical reasoning, and 4) a performance analysis of multiple MLLMs. M3CoTBench systematically evaluates CoT reasoning across diverse medical imaging tasks, revealing current limitations of MLLMs in generating reliable and clinically interpretable reasoning, and aims to foster the development of transparent, trustworthy, and diagnostically accurate AI systems for healthcare.
