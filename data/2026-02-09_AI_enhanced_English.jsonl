This limitation arises from its optimization relying solely on photometric loss without incorporating any 3D structure priors. To address this issue, we propose Coherent supergaussian Modeling with Spatial Priors (COSMOS). Inspired by the concept of superpoints from 3D segmentation, COSMOS introduces 3D structure priors by newly defining supergaussian groupings of Gaussians based on local geometric cues and appearance features. To this end, COSMOS applies inter group global self-attention across supergaussian groups and sparse local attention among individual Gaussians, enabling the integration of global and local spatial information. These structure-aware features are then used for predicting Gaussian attributes, facilitating more consistent 3D reconstructions. Furthermore, by leveraging supergaussian-based grouping, COSMOS enforces an intra-group positional regularization to maintain structural coherence and suppress floaters, thereby enhancing training stability under sparse-view conditions.

This coupling of a local and global world model ensures high-fidelity unrolling alongside computationally tractable differentiation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the Push-T manipulation task, where it significantly outperforms PPO in sample efficiency. We further evaluate our approach through an ego-centric object manipulation task with a quadruped. Together, these results demonstrate that learning inside data-driven world models is a promising pathway for solving hard-to-model RL tasks in image space without reliance on hand-crafted physics simulators.", "AI": {"tldr": "Training RL policies inside learned world models instead of physics simulators, using a novel decoupled gradient method for efficient training with diffusion models.", "motivation": "World models can capture complex dynamics and sensory information better than standard simulators, but are computationally expensive to evaluate, making RL training challenging especially for manipulation tasks.", "method": "Decoupled first-order gradient (FoG) method: a full-scale world model generates accurate forward trajectories, while a lightweight latent-space surrogate approximates local dynamics for efficient gradient computation.", "result": "Outperforms PPO in sample efficiency on Push-T manipulation task, and successfully applied to ego-centric object manipulation with a quadruped.", "conclusion": "Learning inside data-driven world models is a promising pathway for solving hard-to-model RL tasks in image space without reliance on hand-crafted physics simulators."}}

This paper proposes an event-first, frequency-aware forecasting paradigm that directly predicts ramp events and reconstructs the power trajectory thereafter, rather than inferring events from dense forecasts. The framework is built on an enhanced Ramping Behaviour Analysis (RBA$_\u03b8$) method's event representation and progressively integrates statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models. Traditional forecasting models with post-hoc event extraction provides a strong interpretable baseline but exhibits limited generalisation across sites. Direct event prediction using Random Forests improves robustness over survival-based formulations, motivating fully event-aware modelling. To capture the multi-scale nature of wind ramps, we introduce an event-first deep architecture that integrates wavelet-based frequency decomposition, temporal excitation features, and adaptive feature selection. The resulting sequence models enable stable long-horizon event prediction, physically consistent trajectory reconstruction, and zero-shot transfer to previously unseen wind farms. Empirical analysis shows that ramp magnitude and duration are governed by distinct mid-frequency bands, allowing accurate signal reconstruction from sparse event forecasts.

Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics", "summary": "This paper introduces the Mechacnially prOgrammed Radius-adjustable PHysical (MORPH) wheel, a fully passive variable-radius wheel that embeds mechanical behavior logic for torque-responsive transformation. Unlike conventional variable transmission systems relying on actuators, sensors, and active control, the MORPH wheel achieves passive adaptation solely through its geometry and compliant structure. The design integrates a torque-response coupler and spring-loaded connecting struts to mechanically adjust the wheel radius between 80 mm and 45 mm in response to input torque, without any electrical components. The MORPH wheel provides three unique capabilities rarely achieved simultaneously in previous passive designs: (1) bidirectional operation with unlimited rotation through a symmetric coupler; (2) high torque capacity exceeding 10 N with rigid power transmission in drive mode; and (3) precise and repeatable transmission ratio control governed by deterministic kinematics. A comprehensive analytical model was developed to describe the wheel's mechanical behavior logic, establishing threshold conditions for mode switching between direct drive and radius transformation. Experimental validation confirmed that the measured torque-radius and force-displacement characteristics closely follow theoretical predictions across wheel weights of 1.8-2.8kg.

We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).\n  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings provide a dynamical perspective on long-horizon reasoning failure and suggest new limitations on maintaining long-term coherence under purely autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we highlight that short-horizon evaluation protocols may obscure structural instability, indicating a potential shift from scaling toward structured governance in future reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Autoregressive LLMs have intrinsic stability limits in long-horizon reasoning due to exponential decay of decision advantage, requiring structured governance like DAGs rather than just scaling.", "motivation": "LLMs show sharp performance deterioration in long-horizon tasks beyond certain scales, which conventional explanations attribute to task complexity.

This reliance raises practical barriers to deployment and introduces safety and privacy concerns for user-authored data. In this work, we present AgentCPM-Report, a lightweight yet high-performing local solution composed of a framework that mirrors the human writing process and an 8B-parameter deep research agent. Our framework uses a Writing As Reasoning Policy (WARP), which enables models to dynamically revise outlines during report generation. Under this policy, the agent alternates between Evidence-Based Drafting and Reasoning-Driven Deepening, jointly supporting information acquisition, knowledge refinement, and iterative outline evolution. To effectively equip small models with this capability, we introduce a Multi-Stage Agentic Training strategy, consisting of cold-start, atomic skill RL, and holistic pipeline RL. Experiments on DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and DeepResearch Gym demonstrate that AgentCPM-Report outperforms leading closed-source systems, with substantial gains in Insight.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentCPM-Report: A lightweight 8B-parameter local research agent using Writing As Reasoning Policy (WARP) to dynamically revise outlines during report generation, outperforming closed-source systems.", "motivation": "Current deep research systems rely heavily on closed-source or online large models for outline construction, creating deployment barriers and raising safety/privacy concerns for user data.

While 3D hand reconstruction from in-the-wild videos has seen significant progress, reconstructing the involved objects remains challenging due to severe occlusions and the complex, coupled motion of the camera, hands, and object. In this paper, we introduce ForeHOI, a novel feed-forward model that directly reconstructs 3D object geometry from monocular hand-object interaction videos within one minute of inference time, eliminating the need for any pre-processing steps. Our key insight is that, the joint prediction of 2D mask inpainting and 3D shape completion in a feed-forward framework can effectively address the problem of severe occlusion in monocular hand-held object videos, thereby achieving results that outperform the performance of optimization-based methods. The information exchanges between the 2D and 3D shape completion boosts the overall reconstruction quality, enabling the framework to effectively handle severe hand-object occlusion.

To resolve this dilemma, we first define the problem of boundary-preserving class unlearning and propose a pivotal conceptual shift: in the context of OOD detection, effective unlearning is mathematically equivalent to transforming the target class into OOD samples. Based on this, we propose the TFER (Total Free Energy Repulsion) framework. Inspired by the free energy principle, TFER constructs a novel Push-Pull game mechanism: it anchors retained classes within a low-energy ID manifold through a pull mechanism, while actively expelling forgotten classes to high-energy OOD regions using a free energy repulsion force. This approach is implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, circumventing the prohibitive cost of full retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TFER achieves precise unlearning while maximally preserving the model's discriminative performance on remaining classes and external OOD data.

DF performs in-model feature transform using the prediction of each layer and achieves competitive performance on many tasks. However, its exploration in the field of LDL is still in its infancy. The few existing methods that apply DF to the field of LDL do not have effective ways to utilize the correlation among labels. Therefore, we propose a method named Enhanced and Reused Feature Deep Forest (ERDF). It mainly contains two mechanisms: feature enhancement exploiting label correlation and measure-aware feature reuse. The first one is to utilize the correlation among labels to enhance the original features, enabling the samples to acquire more comprehensive information for the task of LDL. The second one performs a reuse operation on the features of samples that perform worse than the previous layer on the validation set, in order to ensure the stability of the training process.

These limitations are particularly acute for the ODE systems of conceptual watershed models. Here we introduce a fully analytic and computationally efficient framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling based on exact parameter sensitivities. By augmenting the governing ODE system with sensitivity equations, we jointly evolve the model states and the Jacobian matrix with respect to all parameters. This Jacobian then provides fully analytic gradient vectors for any differentiable loss function. These include classical objective functions such as the sum of absolute and squared residuals, widely used hydrologic performance metrics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta efficiencies, robust loss functions that down-weight extreme events, and hydrograph-based functionals such as flow-duration and recession curves. The analytic sensitivities eliminate the step-size dependence and noise inherent to numerical differentiation, while avoiding the instability of adjoint methods and the overhead of modern machine-learning autodiff toolchains. The resulting gradients are deterministic, physically interpretable, and straightforward to embed in gradient-based optimizers.

As a result, due to such inflexibility, the viability of previous methods is seriously hindered by the cost of acquiring multi-modal datasets. In this paper, we introduce BrokenBind, which focuses on binding modalities that are presented from different datasets.

Meanwhile, autoregressive video generation enables efficient variable-length synthesis, yet remains under-explored for video editing. We introduce a causal, efficient video editing model that edits variable-length videos frame by frame. For efficiency, we start from a 2D image-to-image (I2I) diffusion model and adapt it to video-to-video (V2V) editing by conditioning the edit at time step t on the model's prediction at t-1. To leverage videos' temporal redundancy, we propose a new I2I diffusion forward process formulation that encourages the model to predict the residual between the target output and the previous prediction. We call this Residual Flow Diffusion Model (RFDM), which focuses the denoising process on changes between consecutive frames. Moreover, we propose a new benchmark that better ranks state-of-the-art methods for editing tasks. Trained on paired video data for global/local style transfer and object removal, RFDM surpasses I2I-based methods and competes with fully spatiotemporal (3D) V2V models, while matching the compute of image models and scaling independently of input video length.

To do so, we introduce a simple synthetic benchmark dataset that is specifically constructed to probe various visual features, along with a set of metrics for measuring visual redundancy, allowing us to better understand the nuances of their relationship. Then, we explore fine-tuning VLLMs on a number of complex visual tasks to better understand how redundancy and compression change based upon the complexity of the data that a model is trained on. We find that there is a connection between task complexity and visual compression, implying that having a sufficient ratio of high complexity visual data is crucial for altering the way that VLLMs distribute their visual representation and consequently improving their performance on complex visual tasks.

True intelligence relies on \"world models\" -- causal abstractions that allow an agent to not only predict future states but understand the underlying governing dynamics. While previous \"AI Physicist\" approaches have successfully recovered such laws, they typically rely on strong, domain-specific priors that effectively \"bake in\" the physics. Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations.

We show that this decoupled formulation introduces substantial deployment and adaptation lag: (1) high time-to-serve, since a speculator must be trained offline for a considerable period before deployment; (2) delayed utility feedback, since the true end-to-end decoding speedup is only known after training and cannot be inferred reliably from acceptance rate alone due to model-architecture and system-level overheads; and (3) domain-drift degradation, as the target model is repurposed to new domains and the speculator becomes stale and less effective.\n  To address these issues, we present Aurora, a unified training-serving system that closes the loop by continuously learning a speculator directly from live inference traces. Aurora reframes online speculator learning as an asynchronous reinforcement-learning problem: accepted tokens provide positive feedback, while rejected speculator proposals provide implicit negative feedback that we exploit to improve sample efficiency. Our design integrates an SGLang-based inference server with an asynchronous training server, enabling hot-swapped speculator updates without service interruption. Crucially, Aurora supports day-0 deployment: a speculator can be served immediately and rapidly adapted to live traffic, improving system performance while providing immediate utility feedback. Across experiments, Aurora achieves a 1.5x day-0 speedup on recently released frontier models (e.g., MiniMax M2.1 229B and Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B). Aurora also adapts effectively to distribution shifts in user traffic, delivering an additional 1.25x speedup over a well-trained but static speculator on widely used models (e.g., Qwen3 and Llama3).", "AI": {"tldr": "Aurora is a unified training-serving system that continuously learns speculative decoding speculators from live inference traces, enabling immediate deployment and adaptation to overcome limitations of traditional offline speculator training.", "motivation": "Traditional speculative decoding deployments separate speculator training from serving, causing three major problems: high time-to-serve (long offline training), delayed utility feedback (true speedup only known after training), and domain-drift degradation (speculators become stale when models are repurposed).", "method": "Aurora reframes online speculator learning as an asynchronous reinforcement learning problem, using accepted tokens as positive feedback and rejected proposals as implicit negative feedback.

We introduce entropy-ordered flows (EOFlows), a normalizing-flow framework that orders latent dimensions by their explained entropy, analogously to PCA's explained variance. This ordering enables adaptive injective flows: after training, one may retain only the top C latent variables to form a compact core representation while the remaining variables capture fine-grained detail and noise, with C chosen flexibly at inference time rather than fixed during training. EOFlows build on insights from Independent Mechanism Analysis, Principal Component Flows and Manifold Entropic Metrics.

To overcome this, the study proposes an enhanced workflow based on the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)-a transparent, state-of-the-art implementation of the GA2M algorithm-optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and preprocessing refinement. Rather than relying on conventional sampling techniques that may introduce bias or cause information loss, the optimized EBM achieves an effective balance between accuracy and interpretability, enabling precise detection of fraudulent transactions while providing actionable insights into feature importance and interaction effects. Furthermore, the Taguchi method is employed to optimize both the sequence of data scalers and model hyperparameters, ensuring robust, reproducible, and systematically validated performance improvements. Experimental evaluation on benchmark credit card data yields an ROC-AUC of 0.983, surpassing prior EBM baselines (0.975) and outperforming Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree models.
