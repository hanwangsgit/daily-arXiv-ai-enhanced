### [1] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement on artificial text overlay detection using only 1,000 images, outperforming CNNs that need much more data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge vision and language by exploring how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with minimal supervision, addressing the underutilized potential of LLMs in specialized visual tasks.

Method: Comprehensive comparison of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on artificial text overlay detection in images.

Result: LLMs fine-tuned on limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) achieved up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data.

Conclusion: LLM-based approaches demonstrate superior adaptability and data efficiency for real-world object detection tasks, providing actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in low-resource visual environments.

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in brain tumor segmentation including class imbalance and limited model generalization, while establishing transparent baselines for future research.

Method: Used U-Net with focal loss parameter tuning and three data augmentation techniques (horizontal flip, rotation, scaling) on publicly available MRI dataset.

Result: Achieved 90% precision comparable to state-of-the-art results, with all code and results made publicly available.

Conclusion: Established a reproducible baseline for brain tumor segmentation research, demonstrating effectiveness of focal loss and basic augmentation strategies.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,

### [3] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses memorization in text-to-image diffusion models by showing that initial noise samples affect when the denoising trajectory escapes memorization basins, and proposes strategies to adjust initial noise for earlier escape.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often memorize training data, raising privacy and copyright concerns. Current methods that delay classifier-free guidance result in poor image-text alignment.

Method: Two mitigation strategies that adjust initial noise samples - collectively or individually - to find samples that encourage earlier escape from memorization basins during denoising.

Result: The proposed approaches significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Initial noise samples play a crucial role in memorization behavior, and strategically adjusting them enables effective memorization mitigation without compromising output quality.

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [4] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Lepp√§lampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study examines gender bias in AI-generated occupational images from DALL-E 3 and Ideogram, finding both reinforce traditional gender stereotypes to varying degrees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in research on representational biases in AI-generated visualizations, as current studies focus mainly on creation process and image quality while overlooking harmful gender biases that affect diverse representation in media and professional settings.

Method: Generated over 750 AI images of occupations using DALL-E 3 and Ideogram tools, then conducted thematic analysis to evaluate representation biases, with additional discussion on ageing and emotions in AI-generated images.

Result: Both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender stereotypes in AI-generated occupational images, although to varying degrees, demonstrating that AI visualization tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.

Conclusion: Proposes suggestions for practitioners, individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images with visible genders, emphasizing the need to address and mitigate harmful gender biases as AI image tools become more widely used.

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAR models suffer from computational redundancy. A dynamic Mixture-of-Experts router with scale-aware thresholding reduces FLOPs by 20% and speeds up inference by 11% while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient image generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer calls at increasing resolutions.

Method: Introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts router integrated into VAR with scale-aware thresholding that balances expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring additional training.

Result: Achieved 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster inference and matched the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic Mixture-of-Experts router effectively reduces computational costs while maintaining image quality in VAR models.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [6] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised OOD detection using epistemic uncertainty from hierarchical Bayesian modeling of GMM parameters in neural network feature space, outperforming existing methods without requiring auxiliary data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised OOD detection methods conflate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in-distribution regions as OOD, and supervised methods require auxiliary OOD datasets.

Method: Employ epistemic uncertainty derived from hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model parameters in the feature space of a deep neural network, without auxiliary data or additional training.

Result: Outperforms existing uncertainty-based methods on SemanticKITTI dataset: 18% improvement in AUROC, 22% increase in AUPRC, and 36% reduction in FPR95 (from 76% to 40%) compared to predictive entropy approach.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised OOD detection approach effectively separates epistemic uncertainty and achieves superior performance without requiring auxiliary datasets or additional training stages.

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [7] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-OSCAR is a hierarchical open-set classifier for activity recognition that identifies known activities with high accuracy while rejecting unknown activities and localizing them to the nearest hierarchical node.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a gap between real-world activities and annotated training datasets in HAR, and traditional classifiers fail to handle unseen activities. Additionally, activity classes have varying degrees of similarity and hierarchical relationships.

Method: Proposed Hi-OSCAR: a hierarchical open-set classifier that arranges activity classes into a structured hierarchy, enabling both known activity classification and unknown activity rejection with localization to nearest internal nodes.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for known activities while effectively rejecting unknown activities. Also introduced NFI_FARED dataset with 19 activities from various contexts.

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR provides more insightful open-set classification beyond binary known/unknown decisions by leveraging hierarchical relationships between activities, improving HAR reliability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [8] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Developed an unsupervised clustering method for automated detection of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in epilepsy patients, achieving high sensitivity (97.67%) and precision (98.57%) with strong correlation to surgical outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, subjective, and labor-intensive. Automated detection methods are needed for clinical use and research to identify epileptogenic zones more precisely.

Method: Uses unsupervised clustering technique to categorize events from time-frequency domain using S-transform. Differentiates HFOs from spikes, background activity, and artifacts in ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500 Hz).

Result: Achieved 97.67% sensitivity, 98.57% precision, and 97.78% F-score on controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, showed strong correlation (0.73 ratio) between HFOs rates in resected vs non-resected contacts with surgical outcomes.

Conclusion: HFOs are promising biomarkers for epileptogenicity. Removing HFOs (especially fast ripple) leads to seizure freedom, while remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

### [9] [Into the Rabbit Hull: From Task-Relevant Concepts in DINO to Minkowski Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08638)
*Thomas Fel,Binxu Wang,Michael A. Lepori,Matthew Kowal,Andrew Lee,Randall Balestriero,Sonia Joseph,Ekdeep S. Lubana,Talia Konkle,Demba Ba,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv2's internal representations are analyzed using SAEs, revealing functional specialization across tasks, dense rather than sparse representations, and a structure based on convex mixtures of archetypes, leading to the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what DINOv2 actually perceives and how its representations work, moving beyond the Linear Representation Hypothesis to uncover the true nature of vision-transformer representations.

Method: Used Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to create a 32,000-unit dictionary, analyzed functional specialization across classification, segmentation, and depth estimation tasks, examined geometry and statistics of learned concepts, and proposed the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis.

Result: Found functional specialization: classification uses 'Elsewhere' concepts (learned negations), segmentation uses boundary detectors, depth estimation uses monocular depth cues. Representations are partly dense, coherent, and organized in low-dimensional locally connected sets. Tokens are formed by convex mixtures of archetypes.

Conclusion: Vision-transformer representations are organized beyond linear sparsity, following a structure where tokens are convex mixtures of archetypes, leading to the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis that better explains DINOv2's internal mechanisms.

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

### [10] [PhyDAE: Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts for All-in-One Remote Sensing Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08653)
*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhyDAE is a physics-guided degradation-adaptive method for remote sensing image restoration that explicitly models degradation physics using a two-stage cascaded architecture, achieving superior performance across multiple degradation types with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing all-in-one restoration methods overly rely on implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation physics, making them inadequate for handling complex heterogeneous degradations in remote sensing images.

Method: Two-stage cascaded architecture with Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) for comprehensive degradation analysis, plus physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation strategies.

Result: Superior performance across all four restoration tasks (haze, noise, blur, low-light) on three benchmark datasets, with substantial parameter reduction and computational efficiency gains while maintaining high restoration quality.

Conclusion: PhyDAE achieves optimal balance between performance and efficiency by transforming implicit degradation features into explicit decision signals and incorporating physics-aware processing, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

### [12] [3D Reconstruction from Transient Measurements with Time-Resolved Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09205)
*Yue Li,Shida Sun,Yu Hong,Feihu Xu,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture is proposed for photon-efficient 3D reconstruction in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, overcoming challenges of low quantum efficiency and high noise through specialized spatio-temporal attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transient measurement systems face challenges in 3D reconstruction due to low quantum efficiency of sensors and high noise levels, especially for long-range or complex scenes in photon-efficient imaging.

Method: TRT uses spatio-temporal self-attention encoders to explore local and global correlations in transient data through multi-scale feature processing, and spatio-temporal cross attention decoders to integrate these features. Two task-specific embodiments are developed: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for NLOS imaging.

Result: Extensive experiments show both TRT-LOS and TRT-NLOS significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic and real-world data from different imaging systems. The authors also contribute a large-scale synthetic LOS dataset and real-world NLOS measurements.

Conclusion: The proposed TRT architecture provides a generic solution for boosting 3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging through specialized attention mechanisms tailored for spatio-temporal transient measurements.

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

TL;DR: Puffin is a unified camera-centric multimodal model that integrates language regression and diffusion-based generation for spatial understanding and generation from arbitrary viewpoints, treating camera as language to bridge modality gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the isolation between camera-centric understanding and generation in spatial intelligence research, and create a unified model that can both interpret and create scenes from any viewpoint.

Method: Introduces a novel paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. Uses both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps. Trained on Puffin-4M dataset of 4M vision-language-camera triplets with language regression and diffusion-based generation.

Result: Puffin demonstrates superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, it generalizes to diverse cross-view tasks including spatial imagination, world exploration, and photography guidance.

Conclusion: Puffin advances multimodal spatial intelligence by unifying camera-centric understanding and generation, enabling flexible and reliable spatial generation from arbitrary viewpoints through the novel camera-as-language paradigm.

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

Motivation: To understand the spatiotemporal statistics of human eye movements and explore whether visual gaze follows similar foraging principles as animals, which has applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces.

Method: Conducted large-scale experiment with 40 participants viewing 50 diverse images, recording over 4 million gaze points using high-speed eye tracker. Analyzed gaze trajectories and trained a CNN to predict fixation heatmaps from image input.

Result: Human gaze trajectory follows Levy walk dynamics similar to animal foraging. CNN model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across novel images, showing gaze behavior is learnable from visual structure alone.

Conclusion: Human visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging, opening avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

*Nicolas Ewen,Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez,Kelly Ramsay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Structured Output Regularization (SOR) - a transfer learning framework that freezes internal network structures while using group lasso and L1 penalties to adapt models to specific data with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional transfer learning freezes weights and adds task-specific layers, which limits adaptation to domain-specific features and can still overfit with limited data.

Method: Freeze internal network structures (e.g., convolutional filters) and use combination of group lasso and L1 penalties to tailor models to specific data with minimal additional parameters.

Result: Achieved competitive results on three few-shot medical imaging classification tasks using DenseNet121 and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established benchmarks.

Conclusion: SOR is a simple yet effective framework that enables broad applicability for transfer learning tasks by freezing internal structures while using regularization to adapt to specific domains.

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

TL;DR: BEAR is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models' embodied capabilities across 14 domains, revealing persistent limitations and proposing BEAR-Agent to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for multimodal large language models focus on specific domains like planning or spatial understanding, lacking a systematic evaluation of comprehensive embodied capabilities needed for physical world interaction.

Method: Introduced BEAR benchmark with 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across 14 domains in 6 categories. Proposed BEAR-Agent that integrates pretrained vision models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning capabilities.

Result: Evaluation of 20 representative MLLMs revealed persistent limitations across all embodied capability domains. BEAR-Agent achieved 9.12% absolute gain and 17.5% relative improvement on GPT-5, and showed benefits for embodied tasks in simulated environments.

Conclusion: BEAR provides a systematic framework for evaluating embodied capabilities in MLLMs, and BEAR-Agent demonstrates effective enhancement of these capabilities, suggesting improved embodied capabilities can benefit broader embodied AI tasks.

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A biologically inspired defense framework using foveal-peripheral processing, saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in to mitigate adversarial attacks without requiring model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional adversarial defenses are computationally intensive, while the human visual system achieves inherent robustness through biological mechanisms like attention-guided sparse sampling and predictive coding.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning-guided saccades to capture multiple foveal-peripheral glimpses, integrates them into reconstructed images through cortical filling-in, and processes them with existing classifiers without retraining.

Result: Improves system robustness on ImageNet across diverse classifiers and attack types while significantly reducing training overhead compared to other defense techniques.

Conclusion: Biologically inspired preprocessing effectively mitigates adversarial noise and preserves semantic integrity, enabling seamless integration with existing systems without retraining requirements.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

TL;DR: LinearSR introduces a holistic framework that overcomes key challenges in applying Linear Attention to photorealistic super-resolution, achieving state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational bottleneck of self-attention's quadratic complexity in generative super-resolution models, while overcoming historical challenges that prevented Linear Attention from achieving photorealistic results.

Method: Uses three key innovations: knee point-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF) to resolve training instability, SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) to mitigate perception-distortion trade-off, and TAG guidance paradigm based on 'precision-over-volume' principle.

Result: LinearSR delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency, achieving SOTA-level speed in core diffusion forward pass while maintaining highly competitive overall multi-step inference time.

Conclusion: This work provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in photorealistic super-resolution, establishing a foundational paradigm for future research in efficient generative super-resolution.

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

TL;DR: A computer vision pipeline for non-invasive wildlife monitoring that extracts key frames from kƒÅkƒÅ parrot videos to enable accurate individual re-identification, replacing traditional physical tagging methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wildlife monitoring methods like leg banding are invasive and time-consuming. Computer vision offers a non-invasive alternative for efficient population monitoring of threatened species like the kƒÅkƒÅ parrot.

Method: Unsupervised pipeline combining YOLO and Grounding DINO for object detection, optical flow blur detection, DINOv2 for image encoding, and clustering methods to extract representative key frames from video recordings at custom feeders.

Result: The proposed key frame selection methods achieve high accuracy in kƒÅkƒÅ re-identification, providing reliable image collections for individual recognition.

Conclusion: This AI-based approach provides a valuable non-invasive alternative to physical tagging, improving wildlife monitoring efficiency and contributing to conservation biology with applications in diverse environments.

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Router is an agentic framework for universal video quality assessment that uses vision-language models as routers to dynamically select and ensemble expert models based on video semantics, achieving superior generalization and interpretability across diverse video types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA models suffer from poor generalization across different content types (UGC, short-form videos, AIGC), limited interpretability, and lack of extensibility to novel use cases.

Method: Multi-tier model routing system that integrates diverse expert models and uses VLMs as real-time routers to dynamically reason and ensemble appropriate experts based on input video semantics, with specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for interpretability.

Result: Matches or surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on various benchmarks, substantially improves generalization and interpretability, excels on Q-Bench-Video benchmark, and capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts.

Conclusion: Q-Router shows promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems and has potential as a reward function for post-training video generation models.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

*Yuanhao Zou,Zhaozheng Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for Medical VQA that addresses modality alignment, hard negatives, and knowledge fusion through multi-level alignment, hard negative mining, and gated cross-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Med-VQA approaches lack unified modality alignment, under-explore hard negatives, and may introduce irrelevant information through knowledge fusion techniques.

Method: Three key components: (1) unified heterogeneous modality alignment across levels, modalities, views and stages using contrastive learning and optimal transport; (2) hard negative mining with soft labels for multi-modality alignment; (3) gated cross-attention module integrating answer vocabulary as prior knowledge.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art on widely used Med-VQA datasets including RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses key challenges in Med-VQA through comprehensive modality alignment, improved negative handling, and selective knowledge integration.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

TL;DR: SkipSR accelerates video super-resolution by identifying low-detail regions from low-resolution input and skipping computation on them, achieving up to 60% faster latency with no perceptible quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based super-resolution is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to higher resolutions and longer videos, while many video regions are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement.

Method: Proposes SkipSR framework that identifies low-detail regions directly from low-resolution input and skips computation on them entirely, only super-resolving areas that require refinement.

Result: Achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality, preserving perceptual quality in both standard and one-step diffusion SR models.

Conclusion: SkipSR provides a simple yet effective strategy for accelerating video super-resolution while maintaining quality, making diffusion-based SR more scalable to higher resolutions and longer videos.

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video

*Yiyang Huang,Yizhou Wang,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-CoDe is a training-free framework that adapts image-pretrained vision-language models for video understanding through dynamic compression and question decomposition to address perception bottlenecks and token overload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending image-based vision-language models to video domain is challenging due to perception bottlenecks from dense temporal visual inputs and token overload from processing extended video sequences.

Method: Proposes D-CoDe with two components: dynamic compression (adaptive frame selection and content-aware token aggregation) and question decomposition (reformulating queries into sub-questions).

Result: D-CoDe effectively improves video understanding across various benchmarks and shows strong performance on challenging long-video tasks.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for handling complex video-language tasks without additional training, providing an efficient adaptation solution for video large language models.

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

*Hongrui Wu,Zhicheng Gao,Jin Cao,Kelu Yao,Wen Shen,Zhihua Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOLK is a fast open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method that uses label-guided knowledge distillation to transfer open-vocabulary knowledge from a 2D teacher model to a 3D student model, avoiding noisy 2D mappings and significantly accelerating inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods map 3D instances to 2D RGB-D images for classification using VLMs, which introduces noise from 2D occlusions and incurs high computational costs, slowing down inference speed.

Method: Design a teacher model that generates high-quality 2D CLIP embeddings for 3D instances with visibility and viewpoint diversity, then distill this knowledge into a 3D student model using label-guided distillation algorithm.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 with AP50 score of 35.7, while running 6.0x to 152.2x faster than previous methods.

Conclusion: FOLK successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by enabling direct 3D instance classification, avoiding 2D occlusion noise and significantly improving inference speed while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised vision transformer method for monitoring cranberry crop growth using time-lapse images, avoiding manual annotations and providing interpretable temporal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual change monitoring in cranberry farming is time-consuming, and existing deep learning methods require hand-annotations and produce hard-to-interpret features.

Method: Fine-tuning vision transformers using self-supervised learning with two pretext tasks: time regression and class prediction to learn latent space for time-lapse evolution.

Result: Created interpretable 2D temporal tracks for crop growth prediction and variety distinction, plus a novel cranberry time-lapse dataset with 8 varieties observed 52 times over 4 months.

Conclusion: The approach provides an interpretable, annotation-free method for crop growth modeling that can generalize to other crops and applications.

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

*Daiki Yoshikawa,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP is a vision-language model that uses an ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-Product metric on a Cartesian product of hyperbolic factors to simultaneously capture hierarchical relationships within concept families and compositional relationships across different concept families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle to simultaneously express hierarchical structures within concept families and compositional structures across different concept families. While hyperbolic space efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, its suitability for representing compositionality remains unclear.

Method: PHyCLIP employs an ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-Product metric on a Cartesian product of hyperbolic factors, where intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual hyperbolic factors and cross-family composition is captured by the ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra.

Result: Experiments on zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the embedding space.

Conclusion: PHyCLIP effectively resolves the dilemma of simultaneously capturing hierarchical and compositional semantic structures in vision-language models through its novel geometric approach combining hyperbolic factors with product metrics.

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and

*Yufei Song,Ziqi Zhou,Qi Lu,Hangtao Zhang,Yifan Hu,Lulu Xue,Shengshan Hu,Minghui Li,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegTrans is a novel transfer attack framework that improves adversarial example transferability across segmentation models by dividing inputs into local regions and remapping semantic information to generate diverse enhanced samples for perturbation optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks but existing methods have poor transferability due to complex contextual dependencies and feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models.

Method: SegTrans divides input samples into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to generate diverse enhanced samples, which replace original samples for perturbation optimization while retaining only local semantic information.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes datasets with four segmentation models and three backbone networks show SegTrans significantly improves transfer success rates by average 8.55% and improves computational efficiency by over 100% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SegTrans effectively addresses transferability issues in adversarial attacks on segmentation models by leveraging local semantic information remapping, achieving higher success rates without additional computational overhead.

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

### [29] [Defense against Unauthorized Distillation in Image Restoration via Feature Space Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08925)
*Han Hu,Zhuoran Zheng,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASVP is a runtime defense method that protects image restoration models from knowledge distillation attacks by perturbing internal feature maps using singular value decomposition to inject structured, high-frequency noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge distillation attacks threaten deep model IP by allowing adversaries to train student networks using teacher outputs. Existing classification defenses don't work well for image restoration due to its generative nature with continuous, high-dimensional outputs requiring spatial coherence.

Method: ASVP uses singular value decomposition on internal feature maps, amplifying top-k singular values to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations that disrupt distillation alignment while preserving teacher output quality.

Result: ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by 60-75% across five image restoration tasks (super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, deraining) with negligible impact on teacher performance.

Conclusion: ASVP provides a practical, strong, and consistent defense against unauthorized knowledge distillation for open-source restoration models, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ro-Bench is the first benchmark for evaluating Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on dynamic out-of-distribution counterfactual video test sets, showing current models degrade significantly on manipulated content but can be improved through counterfactual fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal Large Language Models have shown strong video understanding performance, but their robustness against manipulated video content remains unexplored.

Method: Created Ro-Bench benchmark with high-quality, diverse video data by editing Style, Object, Background and their compositions to generate counterfactual test sets. Evaluated 8 recent video MLLMs and tested fine-tuning with counterfactual data.

Result: Current MLLMs show substantial performance degradation on counterfactual video content. Fine-tuning with counterfactual data improved performance by 21.73% on Ro-Bench and 12.78% across 20 tasks in MVBench dataset.

Conclusion: Counterfactual data is effective for enhancing MLLMs' video understanding ability and robustness against manipulated content.

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

TL;DR: Proposes an object-focused data augmentation framework using segmentation and diffusion-based synthesis to enhance animal detection in drone-based monitoring with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limited data availability in aerial drone-based animal health monitoring, compounded by scene-specific issues like small, occluded animals and lack of domain-specific datasets.

Method: Segments animals from backgrounds and augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create realistic, diverse scenes for animal detection.

Result: Initial experiments show superior performance compared to baseline models on animal detection tasks using the augmented dataset.

Conclusion: The method enables real-time animal health monitoring in data-scarce scenarios by generating domain-specific data, bridging the gap between limited data and practical applications.

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisTANCE benchmark reveals LVLMs' limited visual estimation precision. Proposed Perception-Time Scaling (PTS) paradigm improves perception accuracy from 8.0% to 64.7% by enabling token-rich perception and decomposing complex problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs treat visual perception as one-shot output without modeling perceptual processes, limiting their estimation precision despite advances in inference-time scaling for reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposed Perception-Time Scaling (PTS) paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, combined with reinforcement learning techniques.

Result: PTS significantly improves perception accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%, generalizes to out-of-domain tasks, and even improves math reasoning when combined with synthetic PTS data.

Conclusion: PTS enables perception to align with inference-time scaling by introducing more perception-related tokens and increasing attention to image tokens, demonstrating substantial improvements in visual perception capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

*Zhenyu Wang,Mahathir Monjur,Shahriar Nirjon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmJoints is a framework that enhances mmWave-based 3D pose estimation by adding joint descriptors that indicate sensing likelihood and prediction reliability, improving interpretability and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In mmWave pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections cause models to rely too heavily on statistical priors rather than actual sensor data, which degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and activity recognition.

Method: The framework augments pre-trained pose estimators with additional joint descriptors that explicitly estimate the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the reliability of its predicted location, making bias explicit rather than mitigating it.

Result: Evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 settings show mmJoints estimates descriptors with <4.2% error rate, improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5%, and boosts activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: mmJoints successfully enhances mmWave-based pose estimation by making model biases explicit through joint descriptors, leading to improved interpretability, accuracy, and downstream task performance.

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiMIR is an efficient hierarchical scheduling framework for image retrieval that improves accuracy and reduces computation by using multiple granularities for better alignment and minimizing redundancy through cross-hierarchy similarity consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional retrieval approaches in multimodal LLM applications suffer from limited accuracy, and recent multi-vector retrieval methods still have sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency due to poor query-image object alignment and redundant fine-grained segments.

Method: Proposes HiMIR framework with: 1) hierarchical paradigm using multiple intermediate granularities for varying image objects, 2) redundancy minimization through cross-hierarchy similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity, 3) automatic parameter configuration for different datasets.

Result: HiMIR achieves substantial accuracy improvements and reduces computation by up to 3.5 times compared to existing multi-vector retrieval systems.

Conclusion: The hierarchical scheduling framework effectively enhances retrieval accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency in multimodal LLM applications.

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HandEval, the first quality assessment model specifically for generated hand regions in text-to-image models, addressing common structural distortions and unrealistic textures in AI-generated hands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with generating accurate details in complex local regions like human hands, often producing distorted structures and unrealistic textures. The lack of hand-specific quality assessment limits downstream applications in human-centric generation and AIGC detection.

Method: Proposed HandEval model leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models with hand keypoint prior knowledge. Created HandPair dataset with 48k high/low-quality hand image pairs for efficient supervision without manual annotation, and built a human-annotated test set from various SOTA T2I models.

Result: HandEval shows better alignment with human judgments than existing SOTA methods. When integrated into generation and detection pipelines, it significantly enhances hand realism in generated images and improves AIGC detection accuracy.

Conclusion: HandEval effectively addresses the quality assessment gap for generated hand regions and demonstrates universal effectiveness in downstream applications, providing a valuable tool for improving text-to-image generation quality and AIGC detection systems.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First defensive method against unauthorized AI colorization by embedding imperceptible perturbations in grayscale images to degrade colorization quality while preserving visual appearance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevent copyright infringement from unauthorized AI colorization of monochrome content like manga and films, as no effective prevention methods currently exist.

Method: PAChroma (Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation) - optimizes imperceptible perturbations using Laplacian filter for perceptual quality and applies diverse input transformations for transferability and robustness.

Result: Effectively degrades colorization quality on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets while maintaining visual appearance, meeting criteria of effectiveness, imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness.

Conclusion: First step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI colorization, paving way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

TL;DR: SJD2 accelerates autoregressive text-to-image models by enabling parallel token generation through speculative Jacobi-denoising decoding, reducing inference time while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive text-to-image models suffer from slow inference due to sequential token-by-token decoding, requiring thousands of model forward passes per image.

Method: Proposes speculative Jacobi-denoising decoding that incorporates denoising into Jacobi iterations, introduces next-clean-token prediction paradigm, and uses probabilistic verification to accept multiple tokens in parallel.

Result: The method reduces model forward passes while maintaining visual quality of generated images.

Conclusion: SJD2 provides an effective framework for accelerating autoregressive text-to-image generation through parallel token generation without compromising output quality.

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

*Hoigi Seo,Dong Un Kang,Hyunjin Cho,Joohoon Lee,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to reduce object hallucination in large vision-language models by identifying and masking uncertain visual tokens in the vision encoder using adversarial perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object hallucination in LVLMs, where models generate descriptions of objects not present in input images, remains a critical challenge. The authors argue that uncertain visual tokens in the vision encoder contribute significantly to this problem.

Method: A two-step approach: 1) Use adversarial perturbations to efficiently identify uncertain visual tokens with high epistemic uncertainty, 2) Mask these uncertain tokens during self-attention in middle layers of the vision encoder to suppress their influence on visual encoding.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the method significantly reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can work synergistically with other existing techniques.

Conclusion: Modifying only the vision encoder by identifying and masking uncertain visual tokens is an effective strategy for mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an entropy-informed decoding strategy for autoregressive image generation that improves generation quality and speed by using dynamic temperature control and entropy-aware speculative decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive image generation models have sampling issues due to lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution of image tokens compared to text tokens.

Method: Two main innovations: 1) dynamic temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding.

Result: Achieves higher generation quality with faster synthesis speed, near-lossless generation at about 85% of conventional inference cost, and works across multiple benchmarks and diverse AR image generation models.

Conclusion: The entropy-informed decoding strategy effectively enhances both generation quality and sampling speed in autoregressive image generation models with good generalizability.

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

*Weitong Kong,Zichao Zeng,Di Wen,Jiale Wei,Kunyu Peng,June Moh Goo,Jan Boehm,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Domain Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL), proposing a dual-view framework called DuNe that achieves state-of-the-art performance by handling label noise and domain shifts in 3D LiDAR segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor imperfections, occlusions, and human errors, which degrades segmentation accuracy and is amplified under domain shifts. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains unexplored due to the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds.

Method: Proposes DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Also establishes the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation.

Result: Achieves 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and 52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%.

Conclusion: The proposed DuNe framework demonstrates robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks, showing state-of-the-art performance and effectively handling both label noise and domain shifts in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is

TL;DR: A post-training framework for latent diffusion models in medical image translation that incorporates lesion-aware pixel space objectives to improve lesion delineation and overall image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models trade off pixel-level detail for efficiency, which is critical for medical images where small lesions need accurate reconstruction for reliable diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

Method: Proposed a novel post-training framework that incorporates lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives into pre-trained latent diffusion models for medical image-to-image translation.

Result: The framework improved overall image quality and enhanced lesion delineation in brain CT-to-MRI translation for acute ischemic stroke patients, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models on a dataset of 817 patients.

Conclusion: The post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs and shows substantial potential for broader applications across diverse medical image translation tasks.

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

### [42] [Visual Anomaly Detection for Reliable Robotic Implantation of Flexible Microelectrode Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09071)
*Yitong Chen,Xinyao Xu,Ping Zhu,Xinyong Han,Fangbo Qin,Shan Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An image-based anomaly detection framework using vision transformers for monitoring flexible microelectrode implantation in brain cortex, with progressive granularity patch feature sampling and channel selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flexible microelectrode implantation is challenging due to the probe's deformable structure and interaction with critical bio-tissue, requiring careful monitoring for reliability and safety.

Method: Uses microscopic cameras and a vision transformer with progressive granularity patch feature sampling and channel selection from pre-trained ViT features at four checkpoints: micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point.

Result: The proposed methods were validated with image datasets from the implantation system, showing effectiveness in addressing sensitivity-tolerance trade-offs.

Conclusion: The framework provides reliable anomaly detection for robotic FME implantation by leveraging aligned ROIs and optimized feature extraction from vision transformers.

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

*Weijia Wang,Yuanzhi Su,Pei-Gen Ye,Yuan-Gen Wang,Xuequan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaH-Fit is a state space modeling framework for point cloud normal estimation that uses attention-driven hierarchical feature fusion and patch-wise state space modeling to capture fine-grained geometric structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normal estimation methods struggle with modeling fine-grained geometric structures, and current Mamba-based approaches focus on global shape understanding while neglecting local geometric details.

Method: Proposes Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) to adaptively fuse multi-scale patch features, and Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed components.

Conclusion: MambaH-Fit successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by effectively capturing fine-grained geometric structures for improved point cloud normal estimation.

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of UAVs in military reconnaissance and environmental monitoring requires accurate multi-object tracking technologies for situational awareness, but existing methods struggle with complex backgrounds, small targets, occlusions, and interactions.

Method: GL-DT framework with Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module for joint motion and appearance modeling, global-local collaborative detection strategy for small targets, and JPTrack algorithm to reduce ID switches and trajectory fragmentation.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in MOT continuity and stability while maintaining real-time performance, effectively enhancing small-target detection and tracking accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides strong support for advancing UAV detection and tracking technologies by effectively addressing key challenges in multi-object tracking for UAV applications.

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

TL;DR: Dense2MoE converts dense Diffusion Transformers (DiT) into Mixture of Experts (MoE) structure to reduce inference overhead while maintaining performance, achieving 60% parameter reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large parameter size in DiT causes substantial inference overhead, and aggressive pruning leads to severe performance degradation due to reduced model capacity.

Method: Replace FFNs in DiT Blocks with MoE layers (62.5% reduction) and propose Mixture of Blocks (MoB) for selective activation. Use multi-step distillation pipeline with Taylor metric-based expert initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature loss.

Result: Transformed FLUX.1 [dev] into MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60% while maintaining original performance, surpassing pruning-based approaches.

Conclusion: Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for efficient text-to-image generation by preserving model capacity through structured sparsification rather than aggressive pruning.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

*Mahdi Abavisani,Hamid Reza Vaezi Joze,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient multimodal knowledge transfer for unimodal 3D-CNNs in hand gesture recognition using spatiotemporal semantic alignment loss and focal regularization to avoid negative transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve unimodal 3D-CNN performance for dynamic hand gesture recognition by embedding multimodal knowledge without explicit multimodal fusion, enabling better individual modality networks.

Method: Separate networks per modality with collaboration enforced through spatiotemporal semantic alignment (SSA) loss and focal regularization to prevent negative knowledge transfer.

Result: Improved test time recognition accuracy for unimodal networks and state-of-the-art performance on various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully transfers multimodal knowledge to unimodal networks, enhancing their performance without requiring multimodal inputs during inference.

Abstract: We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple
modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for
the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition. Instead of explicitly combining
multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods,
we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple
modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an
improved performance. In particular, we dedicate separate networks per
available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop
networks with common semantics and better representations. We introduce a
"spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss (SSA) to align the content of the
features from different networks. In addition, we regularize this loss with our
proposed "focal regularization parameter" to avoid negative knowledge transfer.
Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition
accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on
various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

Motivation: To improve sparse representation-based classification (SRC) by leveraging deep learning to learn robust features and find better sparse representations for classification.

of a convolutional autoencoder along with a fully-connected layer. The role of
the autoencoder network is to learn robust deep features for classification. On
the other hand, the fully-connected layer, which is placed in between the
encoder and the decoder networks, is responsible for finding the sparse
representation. The estimated sparse codes are then used for classification.
Various experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed network

TL;DR: SOS is a scalable synthetic data pipeline that pastes high-quality object segments into images using layout priors and generative relighting, outperforming models trained on larger real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large annotated datasets are costly, biased, and hard to scale, while existing synthetic data lacks flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.

Method: Object-centric composition strategy that pastes synthetic object segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative relighting.

Result: Models trained on 100K SOS images outperform those on larger real datasets (+10.9 AP on LVIS detection, +8.4 N_Acc on gRefCOCO grounding). Augmenting real datasets yields strong gains, especially with limited data.

Conclusion: SOS enables controllable dataset construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary settings, supporting targeted data generation for challenging tasks.

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

TL;DR: MSDM is a multimodal semantic diffusion model that generates realistic synthetic image-mask pairs for cell/nuclei segmentation to address data scarcity, particularly for rare morphologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of annotated data for cell and nuclei segmentation in computational pathology, especially for rare or atypical morphologies, where manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly.

Method: Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) that conditions generation on cellular/nuclear morphologies (horizontal/vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, integrated via multi-head cross-attention.

Result: Synthetic images closely match real data with low Wasserstein distances between embeddings; incorporation of synthetic samples (e.g., columnar cells) significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on targeted morphologies.

Conclusion: Multimodal diffusion-based augmentation effectively enriches datasets and improves robustness/generalizability of segmentation models, paving the way for broader generative model applications in computational pathology.

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

*Satya P. Singh,Rashmi Chaudhry,Anand Srivastava,Jagath C. Rajapakse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSepT is a novel polar separable transform that overcomes computational complexity and numerical instability issues of classical orthogonal moments like Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments by enabling independent radial and angular processing through tensor-product construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical orthogonal moment-based image representations suffer from high computational complexity (O(n¬≥N¬≤) to O(n‚Å∂N¬≤)) and numerical instability (O(N‚Å¥) condition number scaling) at large orders due to coupled radial-angular processing that prevents efficient factorization.

Method: PSepT uses tensor-product construction combining Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases to achieve complete kernel factorization, enabling independent radial and angular processing in polar coordinates.

Result: PSepT reduces computational complexity to O(N¬≤ log N), memory requirements to O(N¬≤), and condition number scaling to O(‚àöN), representing exponential improvements. It maintains orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and rotation-covariance while enabling exact reconstruction.

Conclusion: PSepT enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible with classical methods, demonstrating better numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification performance, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis applications.

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

TL;DR: Training feature attribution links test predictions to specific regions of training images, providing fine-grained explanations that reveal harmful examples and spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are opaque systems needing explainability methods. Existing approaches attribute predictions to input features or training examples separately, but both perspectives should be studied jointly to improve trust and accountability.

Method: Training feature attribution approach that connects test-time predictions to specific regions of specific training images, providing test-specific explanations.

Result: Experiments on vision datasets show the method identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious correlations like patch-based shortcuts that conventional attribution methods miss.

Conclusion: Training feature attribution provides new insights into deep model inner workings by jointly studying feature and training example attributions, offering fine-grained explanations that conventional methods fail to provide.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel image-based bronchoscopy topological localization pipeline that provides navigation assistance without requiring patient CT scans, trained only on phantom data with good generalization to real procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bronchoscopy navigation methods rely on CT scans and additional sensors, requiring extra setup and training. A simpler topological localization approach can provide sufficient navigation assistance for surgeons without these requirements.

Method: Image-based bronchoscopy topological localization pipeline trained exclusively on phantom data, eliminating the need for real data labeling and patient CT scans.

Result: The approach surpasses existing methods, particularly showing strong performance on real data test sequences despite being trained only on phantom data.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides effective topological localization for bronchoscopy navigation without requiring patient CT scans or extensive real data labeling, demonstrating good generalization from phantom to real clinical data.

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

TL;DR: A novel approach for instance-level recognition that synthetically generates diverse object instances from multiple domains without using real images, enabling efficient training of foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instance-level recognition faces challenges in creating large-scale annotated datasets due to its fine-grained nature, limiting real-world applicability across domains.

Method: Synthetically generate diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied conditions and backgrounds to create a large-scale training set, without relying on any real images.

Result: Fine-tuning foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains.

Conclusion: This approach offers an efficient alternative to extensive data collection and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where only target domain names are needed as input, unlocking wide real-world applications.

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

*Yuchen Zhang,Yao Lu,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARO is an open-set object detection framework that not only identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into meaningful coarse parent categories within a semantic hierarchy, improving decision-making in safety-critical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object detectors operate under a 'closed-world' assumption and treat all unknown objects as a single 'Unknown' class, which is insufficient for safety-critical applications where different types of unknowns require different responses.

Method: TARO uses a sparsemax-based head for objectness modeling, hierarchy-guided relabeling for auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that learns hierarchical relationships to categorize unknown objects into coarse parent categories.

Result: TARO can categorize up to 29.9% of unknown objects into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduces confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieves competitive performance in both unknown recall and known mAP.

Conclusion: The proposed TARO framework successfully bridges the gap between simple unknown detection and more informative hierarchical categorization of unknown objects, providing more actionable information for safety-critical decision-making.

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

TL;DR: Online Video Depth Anything (oVDA) enables real-time monocular depth estimation by adapting LLM techniques like feature caching and frame masking, achieving high performance on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video Depth Anything (VDA) requires batch processing, making it unsuitable for online/real-time applications. This work aims to overcome this limitation for deployment on edge devices.

Method: Uses techniques from Large Language Models: caching latent features during inference and masking frames during training to enable online processing.

Result: Outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in accuracy and VRAM usage. Runs at 42 FPS on NVIDIA A100 and 20 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson edge device.

Conclusion: oVDA successfully enables real-time video depth estimation with low VRAM requirements, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices.

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

*Sungwoo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comprehensive baseline study comparing 7 deep learning approaches for cricket shot classification, revealing significant gaps between literature claims and practical results, with modern EfficientNet-GRU achieving 92.25% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cricket shot classification from video is challenging due to spatial-temporal modeling requirements, and there's a need for standardized evaluation to address discrepancies between reported and actual performance.

Method: Systematic evaluation of 7 approaches across 4 paradigms: CNN-LSTM, attention models, vision transformers, transfer learning, and EfficientNet-GRU combinations on unified benchmark with modern MLOps practices.

Result: Re-implementations of previous methods showed much lower accuracy (46.0%, 55.6%, 57.7%) than reported in literature (96%, 99.2%, 93%), while modern EfficientNet-GRU achieved 92.25% accuracy.

Conclusion: Modern architectures with systematic optimization significantly improve performance, and standardized evaluation protocols are critically important for sports video analysis research reproducibility.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

*Mukilan Karuppasamy,Shankar Gangisetty,Shyam Nandan Rai,Carlo Masone,C V Jawahar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAAD-X dataset and VCBM framework for interpretable driver intent prediction in autonomous driving systems, showing transformers outperform CNNs in interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As autonomous systems interact more with humans, interpretability of decision-making becomes crucial for safety. Understanding environmental representations and driving tasks remains challenging in deep learning systems.

Method: Created DAAD-X multimodal dataset with hierarchical textual explanations from driver eye-gaze and vehicle perspective. Proposed Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM) that generates spatio-temporally coherent explanations without post-hoc techniques.

Result: Transformer-based models demonstrated greater interpretability than CNN-based models. Introduced multilabel t-SNE visualization to show disentanglement and causal correlation among multiple explanations.

Conclusion: The VCBM framework and DAAD-X dataset enable interpretable driver intent prediction, with transformers showing superior interpretability for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

*Huimin Liu,Jing Gao,Daria Baran,AxelX Montout,Neill W Campbell,Andrew W Dowsey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP is a multimodal deep learning framework that adapts CLIP for cattle behavior recognition using semantic cues and temporal integration, achieving 96.1% accuracy on six indoor behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cattle behavior is crucial for health monitoring, and video-based deep learning can provide accurate recognition, especially for data-scarce scenarios in livestock monitoring.

Method: Adapted CLIP model with temporal integration module, tailored data augmentation, and specialized text prompts to bridge domain gap between web data and real cattle footage.

Result: Achieved 96.1% overall accuracy across six behaviors, with nearly 100% recall for feeding, drinking, and standing-ruminating, and robust generalization in few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of multimodal learning for agricultural and animal behavior analysis, particularly effective in data-limited settings.

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stable Video Infinity (SVI) enables infinite-length video generation with high temporal consistency and controllable storylines by using Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning to train Diffusion Transformers to correct their own errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing long-video methods suffer from accumulated errors and produce homogeneous scenes due to the discrepancy between training on clean data and testing on self-generated error-prone outputs.

Method: SVI uses Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning that injects historical errors into clean inputs, approximates predictions with one-step bidirectional integration, calculates errors with residuals, and dynamically banks errors in replay memory for training.

Result: SVI scales videos from seconds to infinite durations with no additional inference cost, maintains compatibility with diverse conditions (audio, skeleton, text), and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning effectively bridges the training-testing gap, enabling infinite video generation with high quality and temporal consistency while being versatile across different conditional settings.

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

TL;DR: TEMA-LLM is a cross-domain sequential recommendation framework that uses LLMs for semantic tag generation and multi-attention mechanisms to capture both domain-specific and cross-domain user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CDSR systems need to capture both domain-specific and cross-domain behavioral patterns for personalized consumer experiences in e-commerce platforms with diverse services like books, movies, and retail products.

Method: Uses LLMs to generate domain-aware descriptive tags from item titles/descriptions, fuses tag embeddings with item IDs and features, and employs Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention to model user preferences within and across domains.

Result: Extensive experiments on four large-scale e-commerce datasets show TEMA-LLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: LLM-based semantic tagging and multi-attention integration significantly benefit consumer-facing recommendation systems, highlighting LLMs' potential for advancing intelligent user-centric services in consumer electronics.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

TL;DR: The paper proposes HMVDx, a hybrid framework using Multimodal Large Language Models for low-cost shoulder disorder diagnosis from consumer-grade videos, achieving 79.6% accuracy improvement over direct video diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shoulder disorders are common worldwide with high incidence rates, but early diagnosis is challenging in resource-scarce regions. There's an urgent need for low-cost, scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions.

Method: Proposes HMVDx framework that divides action understanding and disease diagnosis tasks between two MLLMs. Uses videos from consumer-grade devices and introduces a novel Usability Index metric based on medical decision-making logic.

Result: HMVDx achieved 79.6% accuracy improvement in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries compared to direct video diagnosis methods.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates significant potential for low-cost MLLM applications in medical diagnostics, particularly for video understanding in healthcare settings with limited resources.

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

*Alina Elena Baia,Alessio Xompero,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs lag behind specialized models in image privacy prediction accuracy despite being resource-intensive, though they show higher robustness to image perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic evaluation comparing large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) against purpose-built specialized models for image privacy prediction, as current trends favor VLMs without proper benchmarking.

Method: Established a zero-shot benchmark for image privacy classification and evaluated top-3 open-source VLMs using task-aligned prompts, comparing their performance, efficiency, and robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.

Result: VLMs currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy prediction accuracy despite their resource-intensive nature (high parameter count and slower inference). However, VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image perturbations.

Conclusion: Specialized models still outperform general-purpose VLMs for image privacy prediction tasks, challenging the trend of adopting VLMs without considering performance trade-offs.

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to filter out high-entropy questions significantly improves accuracy of vision-language models in radiologic VQA by detecting and rejecting hallucination-prone queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of black-box vision-language models in radiologic image-based visual question answering by detecting and filtering out questions likely to generate hallucinations.

Method: Evaluated DSE using two datasets: VQA-Med 2019 benchmark and diagnostic radiology dataset. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times with temperature 1.0. Meaning-equivalent responses were grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from semantic cluster frequencies. Accuracy was recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3.

Result: Baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for GPT-4.1. After filtering high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy improved to 76.3% for GPT-4o (retained 334/706 questions) and 63.8% for GPT-4.1 (retained 499/706 questions), both statistically significant (p < .001).

Conclusion: DSE enables reliable hallucination detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency, significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy, and offers a practical filtering strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a unified framework for joint Temporal Sentence Grounding and Referring Video Object Segmentation using moment-centric sampling and bidirectional propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling strategies for LLM-based RefVOS approaches either use handcrafted heuristics that miss temporal cues or external keyframe models that increase system complexity.

Method: Joint TSG-RefVOS framework with FIND token for key moment identification, Moment-Centric Sampling strategy, and Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation for stable tracking.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RefVOS benchmarks including Refer-Youtube-VOS, A2D-Sentences, and JHMDB-Sentences.

Conclusion: The unified framework effectively addresses temporal reasoning and visual comprehension in RefVOS while maintaining system simplicity through integrated moment grounding.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VPPO is a novel policy gradient algorithm that leverages token perception to improve multimodal reasoning in LVLMs by focusing on visually-dependent tokens and reweighting trajectories based on visual dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods neglect the role of visual perception in multimodal reasoning optimization, particularly how different tokens depend on visual information.

Method: Proposed Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO) that uses token perception to reweight trajectory advantages by overall visual dependency and focuses policy updates only on perceptually pivotal tokens.

Result: VPPO achieves substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models across eight perception and reasoning benchmarks, with consistent effectiveness at 7B and 32B model scales.

Conclusion: The work establishes a token-level perceptual perspective for analyzing multimodal RLVR and presents an effective optimization strategy to significantly enhance LVLMs' multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

*Yuying Li,Siyi Qian,Hao Liang,Leqi Zheng,Ruichuan An,Yongzhen Guo,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CapGeo introduces a caption-assisted reasoning framework that converts geometric diagrams into textual descriptions to improve MLLMs' geometric reasoning, achieving substantial performance gains (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-72B from 8.6% to 59.0%). The paper also presents CapGeo-Bench, a dataset with 4,641 figure-caption pairs and a keypoint-based evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with geometric reasoning despite strong textual reasoning abilities, suggesting the bottleneck is in understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Converting visual geometric content to text offers a promising solution.

Method: Proposed CapGeo framework that bridges visual and textual modalities by converting geometric diagrams into captions. Also introduced CapGeo-Bench dataset with 4,641 curated figure-caption pairs and a keypoint-based evaluation metric to assess geometric captioning quality.

Result: Substantial improvements in geometric reasoning: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improved from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, Claude-Opus-4 rose from 44.8% to 73.0%. The keypoint-based metric strongly correlates with downstream CapGeo performance.

Conclusion: Caption-assisted reasoning provides a new pathway for advancing geometric reasoning in MLLMs by bridging the gap between visual understanding and textual reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid-depth is a self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework that integrates CLIP and DINO foundation models to extract semantic-spatial knowledge through contrastive language guidance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on KITTI benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised MDE methods suffer from insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge extraction, limiting their performance in depth estimation tasks.

Method: A coarse-to-fine progressive learning framework that: 1) aggregates multi-grained features from CLIP (global semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language guidance with a proxy task for depth-aware feature alignment; 2) integrates camera pose and pixel-wise language alignment to refine depth predictions as a plug-and-play encoder for existing MDE pipelines.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics on KITTI benchmark and benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception.

Conclusion: The integration of foundation models (CLIP and DINO) with language guidance effectively addresses feature granularity mismatches and enhances continuous depth estimation in self-supervised monocular depth estimation.

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRCR-Net is a semi-supervised method for nuclei instance segmentation that uses instance-aware consistency regularization and morphological priors to improve accuracy while reducing pseudo-label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully supervised methods are limited by expensive annotation costs, while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize instance-level consistency, lack pathological structure priors, and introduce noisy pseudo-labels.

Method: Proposes Instance-Aware Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) with Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms, incorporating morphological priors to assess pseudo-label quality.

Result: Significantly enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across multiple public datasets, even surpassing fully supervised methods in some scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed IRCR-Net effectively addresses limitations of existing semi-supervised methods by leveraging instance-level consistency and morphological priors, achieving robust performance in nuclei segmentation.

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

*Jinyuan Liu,Zihang Chen,Zhu Liu,Zhiying Jiang,Long Ma,Xin Fan,Risheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Progressive Prompt Fusion Network (PPFN) for thermal infrared image enhancement that handles coupled degradations through prompt-based feature modulation and selective progressive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on individual degradations and struggle with coupled degradations. All-in-one enhancement methods for RGB sensors are ineffective due to different imaging models in thermal infrared.

Method: PPFN establishes prompt pairs based on thermal imaging process, fuses prompts to modulate features for specific degradations. Uses Selective Progressive Training (SPT) to gradually refine handling of composite cases.

Result: Achieves 8.76% improvement on complex degradation scenes. Removes camera noise, retains structural details, and enhances overall contrast of thermal images.

Conclusion: The proposed PPFN with SPT mechanism effectively handles both single and multiple degradations in thermal infrared images, outperforming existing methods on complex scenarios.

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using vision-language models for multi-modal keyphrase prediction, addressing limitations of traditional methods through zero-shot, supervised fine-tuning, and dynamic CoT strategies to improve reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-modal approaches have limitations in handling absence and unseen scenarios, and existing benchmarks overestimate model capability due to training-test overlap.

Method: Leverage VLMs with zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning, then improve reasoning with Fine-tune-CoT using teacher-generated reasoning data, and finally introduce dynamic CoT that adaptively injects CoT data during training.

Result: Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies successfully enhance VLMs' performance for multi-modal keyphrase prediction, with dynamic CoT addressing the 'overthinking' phenomenon and improving reasoning flexibility.

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLINK-Twice is a vision-centric reasoning benchmark that challenges MLLMs to perform fine-grained visual reasoning without relying on external knowledge, moving beyond shallow perception to require analytical observation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning benchmarks primarily assess language-based reasoning and treat visual input as replaceable context, creating a gap for evaluating true vision-centric reasoning capabilities.

Method: The benchmark integrates seven types of visual challenges, natural adversarial image pairs to enforce visual reliance, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of the reasoning process.

Result: BLINK-Twice poses significant challenges to current MLLMs - 20 leading models were evaluated and showed that while language-based reasoning strategies can help, they often result in unstable reasoning. Repeated image observation and active visual interaction improve performance.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals the need for a new paradigm in vision reasoning, highlighting that current models struggle with fine-grained visual analytical reasoning and suggesting that active visual interaction is crucial for advancement.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

*Yikang Zhang,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAD-GS is a 3D Gaussian splatting framework that addresses geometry recovery in challenging urban scenes by identifying unreliable structures, selecting diverse views, and reconstructing missing geometry through multi-view stereo matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS performance depends heavily on initial point cloud quality, which is often poor in unbounded, dynamic urban environments due to limited overlapping views, leading to distortions and artifacts from incomplete geometry.

Method: Uses voxel-based visibility reasoning to identify unreliable geometry, diversity-aware view selection for informative supporting views, and patch matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction to recover missing structures.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches on Waymo and nuScenes datasets, significantly improving reconstructed geometry quality for both static and dynamic objects.

Conclusion: VAD-GS effectively addresses the limitations of traditional 3DGS in urban scenes by enabling geometry recovery in regions lacking initial points through reliable geometric priors.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: Offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to

incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust

*Reza Sedghi,Anand Subramoney,David Kappel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two methods (SIBS and MGS) to exploit sparsity in DETR's MLP layers for efficient inference without retraining, with MGS achieving 85-95% activation sparsity while maintaining or improving performance on COCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models face efficiency challenges in vision tasks like object detection, and the inherent sparsity in DETR's MLP layers presents an opportunity for computational optimization without full model retraining.

Method: Two approaches: Static Indicator-Based Sparsification (SIBS) uses fixed activation patterns to predict neuron inactivity, while Micro-Gated Sparsification (MGS) employs a lightweight gating mechanism with a small linear layer to predict dynamic sparsity patterns.

Result: MGS achieves 85-95% activation sparsity on COCO dataset while maintaining or even improving object detection performance, significantly reducing computation compared to baseline DETR.

Conclusion: MGS provides a practical, input-adaptive approach for sparsifying pretrained vision transformers, enabling efficient deployment without the need for full model retraining.

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Editing 4D scenes from monocular videos based on text prompts is challenging but valuable for content creation and virtual environments, requiring precise localized edits while maintaining scene integrity.

Method: Augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features for semantic querying, uses two-stage point-level localization (CLIP similarity + spatial refinement), and applies diffusion-based video editing with flow and scribble guidance for spatial fidelity and temporal coherence.

Result: Enables high-quality text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, preserving appearance and geometry of unedited areas, and outperforms prior approaches in flexibility and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor provides an effective solution for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing, achieving superior results compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based approaches for low-light video enhancement struggle with heavy noise in real scenes due to limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage I uses Visual State-Space blocks for multi-frame alignment to recover brightness, color, and structure. Stage II introduces recurrent refinement with dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow to balance static and dynamic regions, plus a texture-adaptive loss.

Result: Experiments on real-world low-light videos show DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DWTA-Net successfully addresses noise and temporal information challenges in low-light video enhancement through its two-stage temporal aggregation approach.

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: Existing datasets are inadequate for developing perception systems for forest management as they focus on urban settings or limited species, while complex natural environments with occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose significant challenges.

Method: Created SilvaScenes dataset with expert annotations from under-canopy images across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, featuring 1476 trees from 24 species, and benchmarked modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation.

Result: Tree segmentation achieved 67.65% mAP, while species classification remained challenging with only 35.69% mAP, demonstrating the difficulty of fine-grained species identification in natural forest environments.

Conclusion: SilvaScenes addresses the gap in forest perception datasets and shows that while tree detection is feasible, species classification remains a significant challenge that requires further research and improved methods.

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models face modality gaps caused by dominant feature dimensions across modalities, which degrade calibration performance during test-time adaptation on unlabeled target data.

Method: Proposed dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the influence of dominant dimensions in contrastive VLMs.

Result: The method alleviates calibration performance degradation in test-time prompt tuning and enhances the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: Dimensional entropy maximization offers a simple yet effective solution to improve VLM reliability by addressing modality gap issues through regularization of dominant feature dimensions.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables unlimited character creation while maintaining learned style, demonstrating potential for creative applications in animation and gaming industries.

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

*Parhom Esmaeili,Virginia Fernandez,Pedro Borges,Eli Gibson,Sebastien Ourselin,M. Jorge Cardoso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A clinically grounded evaluation framework for interactive medical image segmentation that reveals key insights about model robustness, 3D context importance, and domain adaptation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison of interactive segmentation algorithms and misrepresents real-world performance in medical imaging.

Method: Proposed a clinically grounded methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, built a software framework for standardized evaluation pipelines, and evaluated state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous tasks.

Result: Found that minimizing information loss in user interactions is critical for robustness, adaptive-zooming boosts robustness and convergence, performance drops with validation-training mismatch, 3D context helps with large/irregular targets, and non-medical models degrade with poor contrast/complex shapes.

Conclusion: Standardized clinical evaluation frameworks are essential for fair comparison and reveal important insights about model design choices, context requirements, and domain adaptation needs in interactive medical segmentation.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

*Zixin Zhang,Kanghao Chen,Xingwang Lin,Lutao Jiang,Xu Zheng,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Litao Guo,Yinchuan Li,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysToolBench is the first benchmark to evaluate multimodal large language models' understanding of physical tools through a VQA dataset with 1000+ image-text pairs across three difficulty levels: recognition, understanding, and creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify MLLMs' true understanding of physical tools, as tool use is fundamental to human intelligence and essential for general-purpose intelligent agents, but current MLLMs' tool comprehension remains unmeasured.

Method: Created a Visual Question Answering benchmark with over 1,000 image-text pairs testing three capability levels: tool recognition (basic function), tool understanding (operational principles), and tool creation (making tools from available objects).

Result: Evaluation of 32 MLLMs (proprietary, open-source, embodied, and VLA backbones) revealed significant deficiencies in tool understanding across all models.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs lack comprehensive tool understanding capabilities, highlighting a critical gap that needs to be addressed for developing truly versatile intelligent agents.

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

*David V√°zquez-Pad√≠n,Fernando P√©rez-Gonz√°lez,Alejandro Mart√≠n-Del-R√≠o*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Samsung smartphone images show diagonal artifacts that cause PRNU fingerprint collisions, but raw images from PRO mode avoid this issue. The artifacts can be used forensically to reduce HDR misdetections and locate synthetic bokeh regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate diagonal artifacts in Samsung smartphone images and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification, particularly fingerprint collisions between devices.

Method: Analyzed images from various Samsung Galaxy S and A series models, compared PRNU verification with and without raw images from PRO mode, and explored forensic applications of the artifacts.

Result: Certain Galaxy S and A models share common patterns causing fingerprint collisions. Raw images bypass the artifact-introducing pipeline, enabling reliable PRNU verification. Artifacts can help reduce HDR misdetections and localize synthetic bokeh regions.

Conclusion: Diagonal artifacts in Samsung smartphones create PRNU verification challenges but raw images provide a solution. The artifacts themselves have forensic utility for image analysis tasks.

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

### [86] [PRNet: Original Information Is All You Have](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09531)
*PeiHuang Zheng,Yunlong Zhao,Zheng Cui,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRNet is a real-time detection framework that preserves shallow spatial features to improve small object detection in aerial images, addressing information degradation issues through progressive refinement and optimized downsampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information degradation during feature extraction, where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based methods have limitations in reconstructing details that deviate from original image information.

Method: PRNet uses two key modules: Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and Enhanced SliceSamp (ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized rearrangement and convolution.

Result: Extensive experiments on VisDrone, AI-TOD, and UAVDT datasets show that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: PRNet effectively addresses small object detection challenges in aerial images by prioritizing preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial features, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods while maintaining real-time capabilities.

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLOWING is a framework that recasts warping as differential vector flow construction, ensuring continuity, invertibility, and temporal coherence for high-quality morphing of 2D images and 3D shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MLPs for morphing require costly regularizations that lead to unstable training and poor feature alignment. The authors aim to overcome these limitations with a more principled approach.

Method: Proposes FLOWING framework that constructs differential vector flows, encoding structural flow properties directly into network architectures to ensure continuity, invertibility, and temporal coherence.

Result: FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster convergence across various applications including face/image morphing and Gaussian Splatting morphing.

Conclusion: The flow-centric approach yields principled and stable transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing while overcoming limitations of traditional MLP-based methods.

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

### [88] [TC-LoRA: Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA for Adaptive Diffusion Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09561)
*Minkyoung Cho,Ruben Ohana,Christian Jacobsen,Adityan Jothi,Min-Hung Chen,Z. Morley Mao,Ethem Can*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TC-LoRA introduces dynamic weight conditioning through hypernetwork-generated LoRA adapters for diffusion models, enabling adaptive control throughout the generation process instead of static activation-based conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models use static conditioning strategies that modify intermediate activations, limiting their ability to adapt as generation evolves from coarse to fine detail.

Method: Uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters on-the-fly, conditioning the model's weights directly at each diffusion step based on time and user conditions.

Result: Significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to spatial conditions compared to static activation-based methods across various data domains.

Conclusion: TC-LoRA establishes a paradigm where conditioning strategy is modified through deeper functional weight adaptation, aligning control with dynamic task demands and generative stages.

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSP-DETR is a unified detection framework for biomedical settings that enables few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen tasks within a single model, outperforming prior methods especially in low-shot and open-set scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection in biomedical settings faces challenges due to scarcity of labeled data and frequent emergence of novel or rare categories, requiring robust few-shot detection and open-set recognition capabilities.

Method: Built on class-agnostic DETR backbone, constructs class prototypes from support images, learns embedding space using augmented views and lightweight transformer decoder, with joint optimization of prototype matching loss, alignment-based separation loss, and KL divergence regularization.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors across ova, blood cell, and malaria detection tasks, especially in low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Conclusion: FSP-DETR provides inference-time flexibility for unseen class recognition, background rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining, establishing a unified solution for biomedical object detection challenges.

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

### [90] [Vision Language Models: A Survey of 26K Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09586)
*Fengming Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large-scale analysis of 26,104 papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS (2023-2025) reveals three major trends: multimodal vision-language-LLM growth, generative method expansion, and resilient 3D/video activity with shifts in techniques and training practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends in computer vision and machine learning conferences, enabling systematic tracking of field evolution and methodological shifts.

Method: Normalized and phrase-protected titles/abstracts from 26,104 papers were matched against a hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and modalities.

Result: Identified three macro shifts: 1) Rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work reframing perception as instruction following, 2) Generative method expansion with diffusion focusing on controllability/distillation/speed, 3) Resilient 3D/video activity with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting. Also found parameter-efficient adaptation dominance and training practice shifts from scratch building to instruction tuning.

Conclusion: The analysis provides consistent longitudinal signals across venues and years, with released lexicon and methodology enabling future auditing and extension, though limited by lexicon recall and abstract-only scope.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

*Peiwen Sun,Shiqiang Lang,Dongming Wu,Yi Ding,Kaituo Feng,Huadai Liu,Zhen Ye,Rui Liu,Yun-Hui Liu,Jianan Wang,Xiangyu Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SpaceVista-1M dataset and SpaceVista-7B model for all-scale spatial reasoning, addressing limitations in current spatial intelligence by creating a comprehensive dataset across 5 spatial scales and developing a scale-aware model with progressive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial reasoning struggles with diverse applications like robotics and autonomous driving due to heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans, labor-intensive annotations, and lack of effective all-scale scene modeling that often leads to overfitting.

Method: Proposes a holistic solution with structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware modeling, and progressive training paradigm. Uses automated pipeline to create SpaceVista-1M dataset (1M QA pairs across 19 tasks), then builds SpaceVista-7B model that accepts dense inputs and uses scale as anchor for experts and progressive rewards.

Result: Extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance with strong generalization across all scales and scenarios. The model shows improved spatial reasoning capabilities beyond traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The work successfully advances all-scale spatial reasoning by creating comprehensive datasets and models that generalize well across diverse scenarios, providing a foundation for broader spatial intelligence applications in fields like robotics and autonomous driving.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on
https://peiwensun2000.github.io/mm2km .

TL;DR: A distillation-based framework that equips vision-language models with action-execution capability by transferring knowledge from small pretrained action models, achieving high success rates while reducing training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training Vision-Language Action (VLA) models from scratch is costly, and existing methods need better generalization while maintaining efficiency.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Lightweight alignment mapping VLM hidden states to action space of small action model, 2) Selective fine-tuning of language model, state encoder, and action modules. Adds only action token and state encoder to original VLM structure.

Result: Achieves 97.3% average success rate on LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). Real-world experiments show 82.0% success rate (17% improvement over teacher model).

Conclusion: Action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate precise actions while substantially reducing training costs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingVLM enables real-time understanding of infinite video streams by maintaining a compact KV cache with attention sinks, recent vision tokens, and recent text tokens, achieving stable performance at 8 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with infinite video streams due to quadratic computational costs from full attention and poor performance on long videos, while sliding window methods break coherence or have high latency.

Method: A unified framework aligning training with streaming inference using supervised fine-tuning on short, overlapped video chunks that mimics inference-time attention patterns without long-context training.

Result: Achieves 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini on Inf-Streams-Eval benchmark, maintains stable real-time performance at 8 FPS, and improves general VQA abilities without VQA-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: StreamingVLM provides an effective solution for real-time infinite video understanding with enhanced general capabilities through simple SFT strategy.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

TL;DR: AScience framework enables automated hypothesis discovery through LLM-based research agents that self-organize into networks to explore large scientific datasets and produce diverse, high-quality findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale scientific datasets create opportunities for exploratory discovery beyond specific research questions, but manually exploring vast hypothesis spaces is challenging.

Method: AScience framework models discovery as agent-network interactions, implemented as ASCollab - a distributed system of LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors that self-organize into evolving networks and peer-review findings under shared evaluation standards.

Result: Experiments show social dynamics enable accumulation of expert-rated results along diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic targets in cancer cohorts.

Conclusion: Socially structured, agentic networks can sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale, though wet-lab validation remains indispensable.

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

TL;DR: LLM-based framework critiques VRP-generated delivery routes using policy criteria, achieving 79-86% accuracy in identifying routing issues, offering scalable evaluation beyond conventional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: India's e-commerce growth faces last-mile delivery challenges due to unstructured addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance estimation, limiting VRP solver effectiveness.

Method: Proposed framework uses LLMs to critique VRP-generated routes against policy criteria, generating and evaluating 400 cases with both open-source and proprietary reasoning models.

Result: Open-source LLMs achieved 79% accuracy in identifying routing issues, while proprietary reasoning models reached up to 86% accuracy.

Conclusion: LLM-based evaluation provides effective, scalable assessment of delivery routes beyond conventional metrics, improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and sustainability in last-mile logistics.

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

### [96] [Unified World Models: Memory-Augmented Planning and Foresight for Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08713)
*Yifei Dong,Fengyi Wu,Guangyu Chen,Zhi-Qi Cheng,Qiyu Hu,Yuxuan Zhou,Jingdong Sun,Jun-Yan He,Qi Dai,Alexander G Hauptmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniWM is a unified world model that integrates visual foresight and planning in a single multimodal autoregressive backbone, improving navigation success by up to 30% through imagination-driven embodied navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current modular architectures separate navigation planning from visual world modeling, causing state-action misalignment and limited adaptability in novel scenarios.

Method: UniWM uses a unified memory-augmented world model with hierarchical memory mechanism that integrates short-term perceptual cues with long-term trajectory context for coherent reasoning.

Result: Improves navigation success rates by up to 30%, reduces trajectory errors, and shows impressive zero-shot generalization on unseen datasets.

Conclusion: UniWM represents a principled step toward unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation by explicitly grounding actions in visually imagined outcomes.

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

*Pantea Karimi,Dany Rouhana,Pooria Namyar,Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla,Venkat Arun,Behnaz Arzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-augmented heuristic design with explanation tools and specialization produces more robust algorithms with 28x better worst-case performance than FunSearch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generate more robust and performant heuristics by enhancing LLM-based approaches with tools that explain underperformance and provide improvement suggestions.

Method: Augment LLM heuristic design with: (1) exposing LLM to underperforming instances, (2) explaining why underperformance occurs, and (3) specializing design to regions in input space.

Result: Produced heuristics with ~28x better worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improved average performance, while maintaining runtime.

Conclusion: Simple augmentation techniques with LLMs can significantly improve heuristic robustness and performance without sacrificing runtime efficiency.

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

### [98] [COMPASS: Enhancing Agent Long-Horizon Reasoning with Evolving Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08790)
*Guangya Wan,Mingyang Ling,Xiaoqi Ren,Rujun Han,Sheng Li,Zizhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COMPASS is a hierarchical multi-agent framework that addresses context management challenges in long-horizon tasks by separating tactical execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into specialized components, achieving up to 20% accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon tasks requiring sustained reasoning and multiple tool interactions are challenging for LLM agents due to error compounding, hallucinations, and loss of coherence, with context management identified as the central bottleneck causing agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted.

Method: COMPASS uses three specialized components: (1) Main Agent for reasoning and tool use, (2) Meta-Thinker for monitoring progress and strategic interventions, and (3) Context Manager for maintaining concise, relevant progress briefs for different reasoning stages. It also includes test-time scaling and post-training pipeline for efficiency.

Result: Across three challenging benchmarks (GAIA, BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam), COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20% relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. Test-time scaling elevates performance to match established DeepResearch agents.

Conclusion: The hierarchical separation of tactical execution, strategic oversight, and context organization effectively addresses context management challenges in long-horizon reasoning tasks, with COMPASS demonstrating significant performance improvements and efficiency enhancements through specialized component delegation.

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

*Wouter Haverals,Meredith Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Humans and AI models both show pro-human attribution bias in evaluating literary style, with AI exhibiting 2.5x stronger bias than humans, systematically devaluing content labeled as AI-generated regardless of actual authorship.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans and AI evaluate literary style given the increasing prevalence of AI writing tools and the subjective nature of aesthetic judgments.

Method: Two controlled experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style: Study 1 compared human participants and AI models evaluating literary passages under blind, accurate, and counterfactual labeling conditions. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a 14x14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators.

Result: Both humans (+13.7pp bias) and AI models (+34.3pp bias) showed systematic pro-human attribution bias, with AI exhibiting 2.5x stronger effect. Attribution labels caused evaluators to invert assessment criteria, giving opposite evaluations to identical features based solely on perceived authorship.

Conclusion: AI models have absorbed human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training, not only replicating but amplifying this human tendency in aesthetic judgment.

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

*Allison Sihan Jia,Daniel Huang,Nikhil Vytla,Nirvika Choudhury,John C Mitchell,Anupam Datta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Agent GPA framework evaluates AI agents using Goal-Plan-Action operational loop with five metrics: Goal Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan Adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a systematic evaluation paradigm for AI agents that covers a broad range of agent failures and enables targeted performance improvements.

Method: Developed the Agent GPA framework based on goal-plan-action operational loop with five evaluation metrics, tested on TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset and internal production data agent dataset.

Result: The framework covers all agent errors on TRAIL/GAIA dataset, supports LLM-judges with 80-95% agreement with human annotation, and localizes errors with 86% agreement for targeted improvements.

Conclusion: The Agent GPA framework provides comprehensive agent evaluation that systematically identifies failures, supports automated assessment, and enables precise performance optimization.

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted
improvement of agent performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReviewerToo is an AI-assisted peer review framework that achieves 81.8% accuracy in accept/reject decisions on ICLR 2025 papers, close to human reviewers (83.9%), with AI reviews rated higher quality than average human reviews but trailing expert contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Peer review suffers from inconsistencies, subjectivity, and scalability challenges in scientific publishing, requiring systematic AI assistance to complement human judgment.

Method: Developed ReviewerToo framework with specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, validated on 1,963 ICLR 2025 papers using gpt-oss-120b model for accept/reject categorization and review quality assessment.

Result: AI achieved 81.8% accuracy vs 83.9% human average; AI reviews rated higher quality than average human reviews but below expert level; AI excels at fact-checking and literature coverage but struggles with methodological novelty and theoretical contributions.

Conclusion: AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness in peer review while human experts remain essential for complex evaluative judgments, providing a foundation for hybrid peer-review systems that scale with scientific publishing growth.

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

### [102] [GTAlign: Game-Theoretic Alignment of LLM Assistants for Mutual Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08872)
*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GTAlign is a game-theoretic alignment framework that treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game, using payoff matrices to select mutually beneficial responses and improving reasoning efficiency and answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional alignment assumes maximizing model reward maximizes user welfare, but this fails in practice as models may generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer concise answers, creating a prisoner's dilemma situation.

Method: Integrates game-theoretic decision making into reasoning and training. During reasoning, constructs payoff matrices to estimate welfare for both LLM and user, selecting mutually beneficial actions. During training, introduces mutual welfare reward to reinforce cooperative responses.

Result: Extensive experiments show GTAlign substantially improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to baselines across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: GTAlign provides a principled decision-making mechanism that mutually benefits both LLM and user, addressing the limitations of conventional alignment practices through game-theoretic reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

TL;DR: LM Fight Arena is a novel framework that evaluates large multimodal models (LMMs) by having them compete against each other in Mortal Kombat II, providing dynamic assessment of strategic reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LMMs fail to capture performance in real-time, adversarial environments, creating a gap between AI evaluation and interactive entertainment.

Method: Six leading open- and closed-source LMMs are tested in a controlled tournament playing Mortal Kombat II, where each agent controls the same character and interprets game frames and state data to select actions.

Result: The framework provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment of LMMs' strategic reasoning capabilities in dynamic settings.

Conclusion: LM Fight Arena introduces a challenging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI evaluation and interactive entertainment by testing rapid visual understanding and tactical decision-making.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR is a framework using mechanistic interpretability to detect data contamination in LLMs by distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based responses through 37 features including confidence trajectories, attention patterns, and activation flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data contamination in LLMs leads to inflated performance metrics where models memorize training data rather than demonstrate genuine reasoning, making reliable evaluation challenging.

Method: Extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep mechanistic properties (attention specialization, circuit dynamics, activation flow patterns), then uses ensemble classifiers trained on these features.

Result: Achieves 93% accuracy on diverse evaluation set, with perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7% accuracy on challenging ambiguous examples.

Conclusion: Mechanistic interpretability shows strong potential for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics by detecting data contamination.

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

TL;DR: A new benchmark for evaluating multimodal RAG pipelines that tests ingestion, retrieval, and reasoning across text, tables, and images, showing closed-source models outperform open-source ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on specific aspects like retrieval, but there's a need to evaluate RAG pipelines holistically across multiple modalities.

Method: Created a 93-question dataset with multimodal content, developed phrase-level recall and hallucination detection metrics, and compared 2 open-source vs 4 closed-source pipelines.

Result: Closed-source pipelines significantly outperformed open-source ones, especially on multimodal and cross-document questions. Human evaluation showed strong agreement with automated metrics.

Conclusion: The benchmark effectively evaluates multimodal RAG pipelines, revealing performance gaps between open and closed-source systems that widen with multimodal complexity.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcphoryRAG is an entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework that reduces token usage by 94% during indexing and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop QA benchmarks through dynamic relation inference and associative search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human cognitive neuroscience where cues activate entity-centered memory traces for multi-hop recollection, the authors aim to develop a more efficient and effective RAG system for complex question answering.

Method: During indexing, extracts and stores only core entities with metadata. For retrieval, extracts cue entities from queries and performs scalable multi-hop associative search across the knowledge graph, dynamically inferring implicit relations between entities to populate context.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks, improving average Exact Match score from 0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG, with 94% reduction in token consumption during indexing.

Conclusion: The entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm is highly effective for complex question answering, validating the cognitive neuroscience-inspired approach to knowledge retrieval.

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

TL;DR: DualResearch is a retrieval and fusion framework that addresses limitations in deep-research systems by modeling two complementary graphs (breadth semantic and depth causal) and fusing their evidence to improve scientific reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep-research frameworks suffer from context pollution, weak evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths, limiting their effectiveness in complex scientific reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes DualResearch with two complementary graphs: breadth semantic graph for stable background knowledge and depth causal graph for execution provenance. Uses semantic diffusion for breadth and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for depth. Fuses evidence via entropy-gated rule with global calibration.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on scientific reasoning benchmarks HLE and GPQA. Using InternAgent log files, accuracy improves by 7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

Conclusion: DualResearch effectively addresses deep-research limitations by modeling epistemic structure and fusing heterogeneous evidence, enabling stable reconstruction of answers and improved scientific reasoning performance.

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

*Ruitong Liu,Yan Wen,Te Sun,Yunjia Wu,Pingyang Huang,Zihang Yu,Siyuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCT is a new knowledge injection paradigm that fuses knowledge graphs with LLMs through semantic graph conditioning and adaptive fusion, outperforming traditional prefix-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prefix-tuning methods simply concatenate knowledge embeddings with text inputs, overlooking relational semantics in KGs and imposing heavy reasoning burden on LLMs to correlate prefixes with text.

Method: SCT uses a Semantic Graph Module with GNN to extract context-aware semantic conditions from local graph neighborhoods, then a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module adaptively modulates textual embeddings via parameterized projectors for deep feature-wise interaction.

Result: Extensive experiments show SCT significantly outperforms prefix-tuning and other baselines on knowledge graph benchmarks, providing more accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

Conclusion: By modulating input representations with semantic graph context before LLM inference, SCT delivers more direct and potent signals for knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tiny-R1V is a novel lightweight 3B multimodal model that achieves faster inference and higher accuracy through two-stage optimization: LIPO for training reasoning models and AMM for merging specialist models into a unified architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of research on reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs and overcome challenges like large model size, overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios.

Method: Two-stage optimization: 1) LIPO - Length-Informed Relative Policy Optimization for training reasoning models to generate shorter, more accurate responses; 2) AMM - Adaptive Model Merging to merge multiple specialist models into unified architecture with gradient projection regularization.

Result: Superior performance on ten reasoning benchmarks covering mathematics, structured data, OCR, and general capabilities, enabling lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Tiny-R1V demonstrates that lightweight MLLMs can achieve efficient reasoning with faster inference and higher accuracy through the proposed two-stage optimization approach.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

*Yincen Qu,Huan Xiao,Feng Li,Hui Zhou,Xiangying Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A comprehensive benchmark for evaluating travel planning capabilities of LLMs, focusing on feasibility, reliability, and engagement with a unified reward system that enables RL integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' travel planning capabilities are insufficient in assessing feasibility, reliability, and engagement of plans, requiring a more comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: Developed a unified benchmark with fine-grained criteria converted to a single reward score, created a dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world requests, and tested various methods including test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and RL via GRPO.

Result: The evaluator achieved 60.75% agreement with travel-expert annotations and outperformed LLM-as-judge baselines. RL generally improved itinerary feasibility over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward scores across base models.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark provides effective evaluation of travel planning quality and enables RL integration, with RL methods showing superior performance in improving plan feasibility compared to other approaches.

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can detect errors in proofs but struggle with partial credit grading. The paper introduces agentic workflows that use reference solutions to create problem-specific rubrics, improving agreement with human grades.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With SOTA LLMs now solving most IMO problems, there's a need to assess their ability to grade proofs - detecting errors, judging severity, and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness.

Method: Used corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions graded on 1-4 scale, and MathArena IMO/USAMO 2025 solutions on 0-7 scale. Introduced agentic workflows that extract reference solutions and derive problem-specific rubrics for multi-step grading.

Result: Models reliably flag incorrect solutions but show calibration gaps in partial credit assignment. Proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more consistent handling of partial credit across metrics.

Conclusion: Agentic workflows with problem-specific rubrics improve proof grading capabilities, addressing calibration gaps in partial credit assignment while maintaining error detection reliability.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

### [112] [Repairing Regex Vulnerabilities via Localization-Guided Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09037)
*Sicheol Sung,Joonghyuk Hahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hybrid framework combining symbolic analysis and LLMs for automated regex repair, achieving 15.4% improvement over state-of-the-art by localizing vulnerabilities and generating reliable fixes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current regex repair methods face a trade-off: symbolic systems are precise but can't handle complex patterns, while LLMs have generalization but lack reliability for syntax-sensitive tasks.

Method: LRR framework that first uses symbolic module to localize vulnerable subpatterns, then invokes LLM to generate semantically equivalent fixes for the isolated segments.

Result: Successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for rule-based approaches while avoiding semantic errors of LLM-only methods, improving repair rate by 15.4% over state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Provides validated methodology for automated repair that harnesses LLM generalization while enforcing reliability through symbolic localization.

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

### [113] [Auto-scaling Continuous Memory for GUI Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09038)
*Wenyi Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruoxin Yuan,Vivian Yu,Stephen Wang,Zhiting Hu,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Continuous memory embeddings for GUI agents reduce context costs while preserving visual details, improving performance on long-horizon tasks and unfamiliar interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior GUI agents compress trajectories into text tokens, which increases context length and misses important visual cues like widget size and position.

Method: Encode GUI trajectories into fixed-length continuous embeddings using VLM as encoder, plug into backbone input layer. Use auto-scaling data flywheel for low-cost memory growth via search, task synthesis, rollout, and verification.

Result: Performance improves monotonically with memory size and retrieval depth. Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4o and Claude-4.

Conclusion: Continuous memory approach effectively reduces context costs while preserving fine-grained visual information, enabling GUI agents to handle long-horizon tasks and distribution shifts more effectively.

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

*Sang Hun Kim,Jongmin Lee,Dongkyu Park,So Young Lee,Yosep Chong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study proposes integrating psychoanalysis and MBTI personality types to create artificial consciousness modules, developing three consciousness types and 16 personality characters to simulate human-like cognition in decision-making scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with human consciousness simulation due to hallucination issues, and there's a need to develop more intuitive AI systems that can better mimic human cognitive processes.

Method: Developed three artificial consciousness types based on psychoanalysis (self-awareness, unconsciousness, preconsciousness) and 16 MBTI personality characters with attributes like needs, status, and memories. Tested with 10 situations across 7 cognitive attributes using survey evaluation, ChatGPT classification, and qualitative review.

Result: Both quantitative and qualitative analyses showed high likelihood of well-simulated consciousness, though differences between characters and consciousness types were not very significant.

Conclusion: The models incorporating psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead to more intuitive and adaptable AI systems with humanoid consciousness, opening new avenues for improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for
improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEC$^3$O is a multi-expert consensus system that improves code time complexity prediction by assigning LLMs to specific complexity classes and using structured debates with weighted consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes, and no single LLM excels at every class, suggesting the need for a specialized multi-expert approach.

Method: Assigns LLMs to complexity classes based on performance, provides class-specialized instructions to create experts, and uses structured debates with weighted consensus mechanism to integrate predictions.

Result: Outperforms open-source baselines by at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores, surpasses GPT-4o-mini in macro-F1 on average, and achieves competitive F1 scores with GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness of multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy for final predictions in code complexity analysis.

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

*Jingxuan Wu,Zhenglin Wan,Xingrui Yu,Yuzhe Yang,Bo An,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A training-free method to increase diversity in flow-based text-to-image generation by adding orthogonal stochastic perturbations and feature-space objectives during inference, without degrading quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing users to repeatedly sample for diversity, which is costly and inefficient.

Method: Uses feature-space objective for lateral trajectory spread and time-scheduled stochastic perturbation orthogonal to generation flow, requiring no retraining or base sampler modifications.

Result: Consistently improves diversity metrics (Vendi Score, Brisque) across multiple text-to-image settings while maintaining image quality and alignment under fixed sampling budgets.

Conclusion: The method provides principled diversity enhancement through geometric constraints that preserve marginal distribution, offering robust quality maintenance alongside improved variation.

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

*Bicheng Wang,Jinping Wang,Yibo Sue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A higher-order network dynamics identification method using dynamic hypergraph learning and dual-driven prediction for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use simple graphs that only capture pairwise relationships, missing non-pairwise structured relationships. First-order GNNs struggle with dynamic non-pairwise relationships, and current models lack either accuracy or interpretability.

Method: Uses dynamic hypergraph learning to capture higher-order non-pairwise relationships, and a dual-driven prediction module combining Koopman operator theory (to linearize nonlinear dynamics) with physical information neural differential equations to ensure physical consistency.

Result: Validated on public and industrial chain network datasets, showing good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by capturing higher-order relationships and ensuring both accuracy and interpretability through dual-driven prediction.

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents in social deduction games focus on information processing and strategy but overlook persuasive communication, which is crucial for influencing other players' beliefs and responses to achieve success.

Method: Formalize turn-based dialogue as Stackelberg competition, with current player as leader influencing follower's response. Use reinforcement learning to train agents to optimize utterances for persuasive impact.

Result: Comprehensive experiments across three diverse social deduction games show the proposed agents significantly outperform baseline approaches.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents capable of strategic social influence, with broader implications for scenarios requiring persuasive communication.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

*Hao Zeng,Jianguo Huang,Bingyi Jing,Hongxin Wei,Bo An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PAC reasoning method dynamically switches between thinking and non-thinking modes in large reasoning models to reduce computational costs while guaranteeing bounded performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models have high computational costs during deployment, and existing dynamic switching approaches lack statistical guarantees for performance loss, which is critical for high-stakes applications.

Method: Proposed PAC reasoning constructs an upper confidence bound on performance loss as a monotone function of uncertainty score, then determines a threshold for switching to non-thinking model to ensure bounded performance loss.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show the method can save computational budgets while controlling user-specified performance loss.

Conclusion: The proposed PAC reasoning approach provides a distribution-free method to reduce computational costs in large reasoning models while maintaining guaranteed performance bounds.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

TL;DR: LLMs show systematic bias in medical advice generation, producing less readable and more complex responses for Indigenous and intersex patients, with amplified disparities for intersectional groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how bias in LLM-generated medical advice may impact different social groups and perpetuate health disparities, especially as LLMs become more widely used in healthcare.

Method: Exploratory analysis comparing natural language features of LLM responses to medical questions across simulated patient profiles varying in sex, age, and ethnicity.

Result: LLMs generate responses that systematically differ between social groups, with Indigenous and intersex patients receiving less readable and more complex advice, and these disparities amplify for intersectional groups.

Conclusion: Urgent need for AI literacy and mitigation by developers to address systemic biases in LLM-generated medical advice and prevent unjust patient support.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs and LRMs have strong performance but their computational limits, especially spatial complexity constrained by finite context windows, remain poorly understood. Most existing benchmarks focus on NP problems, but PSPACE-complete problems provide a more rigorous standard.

Method: Created a benchmark using two PSPACE-complete regex problems (RegexEQ and RegexMin) by performing double-exponential space exploration to construct a labeled dataset of over 1 million regex instances with sound filtering. Evaluated 6 LLMs and 5 LRMs of varying scales.

Result: Extensive evaluations revealed common failure patterns including verbosity and repetition. The benchmark provides well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation metrics for assessing computational limitations.

Conclusion: This work presents the first empirical investigation into spatial computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for evaluating advanced reasoning capabilities using PSPACE-complete problems as a more rigorous standard.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation

Motivation: Address limitations of traditional LLMs in real-world tasks by developing 'agentic' LLMs that can automate complex tasks and achieve human-like performance.

Method: Proposes an integrated architecture with four key systems: perception (converts environmental inputs), reasoning (plans and adapts using techniques like Chain-of-Thought), memory (short-term and long-term knowledge retention), and execution (translates decisions into actions).

Result: The integration of these systems enables the creation of more capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for autonomous intelligent behavior.

Conclusion: A comprehensive framework for developing LLM-powered agents that can effectively bridge the gap between traditional LLM limitations and human-level task performance through integrated cognitive systems.

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for

### [124] [Localist LLMs -- A Mathematical Framework for Dynamic Locality Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09338)
*Joachim Diederich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for training LLMs with adjustable internal representations from localist to distributed encodings via a tunable "locality dial" parameter, enabling continuous interpolation between interpretable and high-performance modes without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable practitioners to balance interpretability and performance in LLMs, particularly for regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability, by providing dynamic control over representation localization.

Method: Uses group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, and dynamic rule injection to create a tunable locality parameter that controls representation localization during training and inference.

Result: Mathematical proofs establish threshold conditions where attention concentrates on semantically relevant blocks with exponential bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity, achieving low entropy and high fidelity with negligible error.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables continuous adjustment between interpretable rule-based representations and efficient distributed encodings, supporting applications that require both transparency and high performance.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

*Davide Maltoni,Matteo Ferrara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Small language models can solve deductive reasoning tasks by learning underlying rules, with induction heads playing a central role in rule completion and chaining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models perform logical reasoning internally, particularly exploring whether they learn rules or operate as statistical learners.

Method: Analyzed a small language model's internal representations and computational circuits while solving deductive reasoning tasks.

Result: Found that the model learns underlying rules rather than statistical patterns, with induction heads implementing rule completion and chaining for logical inference.

Conclusion: Language models can perform logical reasoning through learned rule-based mechanisms, with induction heads being crucial components for implementing logical inference steps.

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in
solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding
internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a
small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

*Augustin Delecluse,Pierre Schaus,Pascal Van Hentenryck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces sequence variables in Constraint Programming to overcome limitations of classical successor models in Vehicle Routing Problems, enabling optional visits and insertion heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical CP models based on successor variables cannot effectively handle optional visits or insertion-based heuristics in Vehicle Routing Problems, creating limitations in modeling flexibility.

Method: The paper formalizes sequence variables within CP, defines their domain and update operations, introduces consistency levels, implements data structures for integration into CP solvers, and develops global constraints specifically for vehicle routing.

Result: The implementation demonstrates effectiveness through simplified problem modeling and competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride Problem.

Conclusion: Sequence variables provide a more flexible and effective approach for modeling Vehicle Routing Problems in Constraint Programming, overcoming limitations of classical successor-based models.

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

*Christian Bluethgen,Dave Van Veen,Daniel Truhn,Jakob Nikolas Kather,Michael Moor,Malgorzata Polacin,Akshay Chaudhari,Thomas Frauenfelder,Curtis P. Langlotz,Michael Krauthammer,Farhad Nooralahzadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reviews LLM-driven agentic systems in radiology, examining their design, applications, evaluation methods, and challenges like error cascades and health IT integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology's multimodal data streams and complex workflows make it ideal for LLM agents that can automate repetitive tasks and adapt to context, but current LLM use underutilizes their potential for multi-step workflows.

Method: The paper examines how equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to drive systems with varying autonomy levels, from semi-automated workflows to adaptive agents managing complex processes.

Result: LLMs and their multimodal variants have shown promising performance for individual radiology tasks like information extraction and report summarization, but their full potential requires integration into agentic systems.

Conclusion: LLM-driven agentic systems offer significant potential for radiology workflow automation, but face challenges including error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT integration that need to be addressed.

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

TL;DR: A reimplementation of Google's Titans model shows its neural memory component consistently improves performance over attention-only models, but chunking issues prevent it from always outperforming established baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reproducibility issues with Google's Titans model by creating a lightweight reimplementation and conducting comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks.

Method: Developed a reimplementation of Titans and evaluated it on Masked Language Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, and Recommendation tasks, comparing against established baselines.

Result: Titans does not always outperform established baselines due to chunking issues, but its Neural Memory component consistently improves performance compared to attention-only models.

Conclusion: The model shows innovative potential but has practical limitations, raising questions for future research on neural memory architectures.

Abstract: By the end of 2024, Google researchers introduced Titans: Learning at Test
Time, a neural memory model achieving strong empirical results across multiple
tasks. However, the lack of publicly available code and ambiguities in the
original description hinder reproducibility. In this work, we present a
lightweight reimplementation of Titans and conduct a comprehensive evaluation
on Masked Language Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, and Recommendation tasks.
Our results reveal that Titans does not always outperform established baselines
due to chunking. However, its Neural Memory component consistently improves
performance compared to attention-only models. These findings confirm the
model's innovative potential while highlighting its practical limitations and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data lakehouses handle sensitive workloads where AI automation raises trust, correctness, and governance concerns, requiring safe-by-design approaches for agentic workflows.

Method: Using Bauplan as a case study, implement data branching and declarative environments that extend to agents, with proof-of-concept agents repairing data pipelines using correctness checks inspired by proof-carrying code.

Result: Prototype demonstrates that untrusted AI agents can operate safely on production data while enabling reproducibility and observability, reducing the attack surface.

Conclusion: Programmable lakehouses provide the right abstractions for safe agentic workflows, outlining a path toward fully agentic lakehouses with built-in safety mechanisms.

Abstract: Data lakehouses run sensitive workloads, where AI-driven automation raises
concerns about trust, correctness, and governance. We argue that API-first,
programmable lakehouses provide the right abstractions for safe-by-design,
agentic workflows. Using Bauplan as a case study, we show how data branching
and declarative environments extend naturally to agents, enabling
reproducibility and observability while reducing the attack surface. We present
a proof-of-concept in which agents repair data pipelines using correctness

### [130] [GraphMERT: Efficient and Scalable Distillation of Reliable Knowledge Graphs from Unstructured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09580)
*Margarita Belova,Jiaxin Xiao,Shikhar Tuli,Niraj K. Jha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphMERT is a tiny graphical encoder-only model that creates high-quality knowledge graphs from text, forming a neurosymbolic AI stack that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with superior symbolic representations compared to large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neurosymbolic AI has not scaled well due to implicit representations and approximate reasoning in neural approaches limiting interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs can address the symbolic side but automatically deriving reliable KGs from text has been an open problem.

Method: GraphMERT is an 80M-parameter graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations, forming a modular neurosymbolic stack with neural learning of abstractions and symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning.

Result: On PubMed diabetes papers, GraphMERT achieved 69.8% FActScore and 68.8% ValidityScore, significantly outperforming a 32B-parameter LLM baseline which achieved only 40.2% FActScore and 43.0% ValidityScore.

Conclusion: GraphMERT + KG is the first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art benchmark accuracy with superior symbolic representations, addressing key limitations of both traditional neurosymbolic approaches and large language models.

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

### [131] [LiveOIBench: Can Large Language Models Outperform Human Contestants in Informatics Olympiads?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09595)
*Kaijian Zou,Aaron Xiong,Yunxiang Zhang,Frederick Zhang,Yueqi Ren,Jirong Yang,Ayoung Lee,Shitanshu Bhushan,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LiveOIBench is a comprehensive benchmark with 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems featuring extensive test cases, designed to evaluate LLM coding capabilities against top human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coding benchmarks lack exceptionally challenging problems, have insufficient test coverage, and rely on online APIs that limit accessibility. LiveOIBench addresses these limitations by providing high-quality Olympiad problems for better evaluation.

Method: Created benchmark with 403 problems from 72 official Informatics Olympiads (2023-2025), each with ~60 expert-designed test cases. Features curated tasks with subtask rubrics, elite contestant performance data integration, continuous updates, and self-contained evaluation system.

Result: GPT-5 achieved 81.76th percentile, strong but below top human contestants (usually >90th percentile). GPT-OSS-120B reached only 60th percentile, showing significant gap between open-weight and frontier closed models. Robust reasoning models benefit from precise problem analysis over excessive exploration.

Conclusion: LiveOIBench provides a rigorous benchmark for evaluating LLM coding capabilities. Results show current models still lag behind top human performance, with structured analysis being more effective than excessive exploration. The benchmark enables reproducible offline assessments and will be publicly available.

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

### [132] [Energy-Driven Steering: Reducing False Refusals in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08646)
*Eric Hanchen Jiang,Weixuan Ou,Run Liu,Shengyuan Pang,Guancheng Wan,Ranjie Duan,Wei Dong,Kai-Wei Chang,XiaoFeng Wang,Ying Nian Wu,Xinfeng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Energy-Driven Steering (EDS) is a fine-tuning free framework that uses an Energy-Based Model to dynamically steer LLM activations during inference, reducing false refusals while maintaining safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety alignment techniques make LLMs over-cautious, causing them to refuse benign prompts. The goal is to enhance safety while reducing false refusals.

Method: Train a lightweight Energy-Based Model to assign high energy to undesirable states and low energy to desirable ones. Use energy gradients to dynamically steer LLM hidden states during inference without modifying weights.

Result: Substantially lowers false refusal rates, raising compliance on ORB-H benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining baseline safety performance.

Conclusion: EDS provides an effective paradigm for building LLMs that achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety through inference-time intervention.

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

*Edward Y. Chang,Ethan Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WILSON is a diagnostic suite that detects when LLM outputs change under harmless edits like reordering, fine-tuning, or prompt variations, helping maintain reliability without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit sensitivity to harmless edits that violate intended invariances, breaking continuous integration and forcing trade-offs between safety and speed.

Method: WILSON uses inverse-free curvature maps with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, plus activation-level commutators to flag reorder risks in standard Transformers.

Result: The tool provides cheap, model-agnostic signals as thresholds and CSV artifacts that enable guarding against order effects and catching fine-tuning regressions.

Conclusion: WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations, allowing reliability and throughput to improve together without changing model architecture or training.

Abstract: Large language models can change answers under harmless edits that matter in
practice: RAG outputs flip when passages are reordered, fine-tuning erodes
invariances learned at pretraining, debate or chain-of-thought prompts take
path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near
decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break
continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects
are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context
length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal
verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that
converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into
system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions
and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level
commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute,
model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV
artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against
order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and
long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short,
WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability
and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in rare genetic disease diagnosis: insufficient patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and vast number of possible causative genes, which cause prolonged diagnostic delays especially in resource-limited settings.

Method: Propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires only patient phenotypes to identify causal genes and retrieve focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation.

Result: Demonstrates competitive and robust causal gene prediction on two biomedical datasets, with significant performance gains when integrated with other candidate gene prioritization frameworks.

Conclusion: RareNet democratizes access to sophisticated genetic analysis by requiring only phenotypic data, offering particular value for underserved populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

Abstract: Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient
patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of
possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic
journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately
affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are
scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires
only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve
focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can
function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing
filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing
their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through
comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive
and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when
integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is
readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to
sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved
populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

*Zipo Jibao,Yingyi Fu,Xinyang Chen,Guoting Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two point-level methods (LD and LCD) to address inner-instance distribution shifts in time series forecasting, which existing instance normalization techniques fail to handle effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time series exhibit complex non-stationary characteristics that cause distribution shifts over time, negatively impacting model performance. Existing methods don't account for shifts within individual instances.

Method: Two novel point-level methods: Learning Distribution (LD) eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting input/output distributions with different parameters at each time step, and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD) uses neural networks to predict output scaling coefficients.

Result: The methods were evaluated with various backbone models across public benchmarks and demonstrated effectiveness through comparative experiments.

Conclusion: The point-level paradigm effectively addresses inner-instance distribution shifts in time series forecasting, improving model performance.

Abstract: Real-world time series are influenced by numerous factors and exhibit complex
non-stationary characteristics. Non-stationarity can lead to distribution
shifts, where the statistical properties of time series change over time,
negatively impacting model performance. Several instance normalization
techniques have been proposed to address distribution shifts in time series
forecasting. However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within
individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle
inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods:
Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD
eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input
and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD
utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We
evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across
public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm
through comparative experiments.

*Yuni Lai,Xiaoyu Xue,Linghui Shen,Yulun Wu,Gaolei Li,Song Guo,Kai Zhou,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LeFCert is the first provably robust few-shot classifier for language-empowered foundation models, addressing poisoning attacks through certified robustness with adaptive blending of textual and feature embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs) are vulnerable to poisoning attacks in few-shot learning scenarios, and existing defenses lack formal guarantees and remain vulnerable to adaptive attacks.

Method: LeFCert integrates textual and feature embeddings with adaptive blending, uses a twofold trimmed mean prototype, and derives provable bounds for classification scores. Two variants are proposed: LeFCert-L with randomized smoothing for Lipschitz continuity, and LeFCert-C for collective certification with shared poisoning budgets.

Result: LeFCert achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified accuracy compared to existing baselines, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: LeFCert provides the first provably robust framework for few-shot classifiers in LeFMs, offering certified protection against poisoning attacks with practical computational efficiency for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP,
have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features
with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like
few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support
datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning
attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade
performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal
guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified
robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for
few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical
gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is
tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification
(\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an
adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a
twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for
classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning
scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two
variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L
incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive
robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective
certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning
budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified
accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness
mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for
real-world applications.

### [137] [How Scale Breaks "Normalized Stress" and KL Divergence: Rethinking Quality Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08660)
*Kiran Smelser,Kaviru Gunaratne,Jacob Miller,Stephen Kobourov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how common quality metrics for 2D data visualizations (normalized stress and KL divergence) are sensitive to uniform scaling, which doesn't meaningfully change projections. It introduces a simple method to make these metrics scale-invariant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional data visualization often uses 2D scatter plots, but evaluating their accuracy is challenging. Current quality metrics like normalized stress and KL divergence are sensitive to uniform scaling, which shouldn't affect projection quality assessment.

Method: The authors investigate scaling effects analytically and empirically, showing how values change and affect dimension reduction evaluations. They introduce a simple technique to make both metrics scale-invariant.

Result: The paper demonstrates that both normalized stress and KL divergence values change significantly with scaling, affecting technique evaluations. The proposed scale-invariant method accurately captures expected behavior on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Current quality metrics for data visualization projections are unnecessarily sensitive to uniform scaling. The proposed scale-invariant approach provides more meaningful evaluation of projection quality without this artificial sensitivity.

Abstract: Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific
disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One
of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional
scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because
visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers
often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness
to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized
stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the
projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the
projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used
in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique,
is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of
scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing
just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction
technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics
scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a
small benchmark.

*Zipo Jibao,Yingyi Fu,Xinyang Chen,Guoting Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CATS-Linear is a novel linear model that uses classification to dynamically route time series instances to specialized predictors, combined with trend-seasonal decomposition and complex-domain projections, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance with fixed hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear models show competitive forecasting performance but enhancement methodologies are underexplored. The hypothesis is that different time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, requiring specialized handling.

Method: Uses Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI) to dynamically route instances to dedicated predictors via classification. Implements trend-seasonal decomposition with decoupling-linear mapping-recoupling framework for trends and complex-domain linear projections for seasonal components.

Result: Extensive experiments show CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines and delivers SOTA performance against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

Conclusion: The proposed CATS-Linear model successfully enhances linear forecasting by dynamically routing instances to specialized predictors and using improved decomposition techniques, achieving competitive performance without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting
performance competitive with complex architectures, yet methodologies for
enhancing linear models remain underexplored. Motivated by the hypothesis that
distinct time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, we
propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model
CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI).
CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification,
enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected
risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the
trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear
mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear
projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that
CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines while delivering SOTA accuracy
against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

Abstract: Genomic Selection (GS) uses whole-genome information to predict crop
phenotypes and accelerate breeding. Traditional GS methods, however, struggle
with prediction accuracy for complex traits and large datasets. We propose
DPCformer, a deep learning model integrating convolutional neural networks with
a self-attention mechanism to model complex genotype-phenotype relationships.
We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato,
rice, chickpea). Our approach uses an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP
data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature
selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize
datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved
by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On
small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait
increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by
16.62%. DPCformer demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness in small-sample
scenarios, and enhanced interpretability, providing a powerful tool for
precision breeding and addressing global food security challenges.

### [140] [FreqCa: Accelerating Diffusion Models via Frequency-Aware Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08669)
*Jiacheng Liu,Peiliang Cai,Qinming Zhou,Yuqi Lin,Deyang Kong,Benhao Huang,Yupei Pan,Haowen Xu,Chang Zou,Junshu Tang,Shikang Zheng,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FreqCa is a frequency-aware caching method that reuses low-frequency features and predicts high-frequency ones using interpolation, reducing diffusion transformer inference costs while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature caching methods assume feature continuity across timesteps, but this doesn't always hold. Analysis shows different frequency bands exhibit different dynamics - low frequencies have high similarity but poor continuity, while high frequencies show continuity but poor similarity.

Method: Proposed Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa) that reuses low-frequency features directly based on similarity and uses second-order Hermite interpolation to predict high-frequency features based on continuity. Also introduced caching Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF) to reduce memory footprint.

Result: Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate effectiveness in both generation and editing tasks. Memory footprint reduced by 99%.

Conclusion: FreqCa effectively addresses diffusion transformer inference costs by leveraging frequency domain insights and achieves significant computational savings while maintaining performance.

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.
Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on

### [141] [Don't Waste Mistakes: Leveraging Negative RL-Groups via Confidence Reweighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08696)
*Yunzhen Feng,Parag Jain,Anthony Hartshorn,Yaqi Duan,Julia Kempe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LENS improves RLVR by leveraging negative groups (where no sampled response is correct) through confidence-weighted penalties on incorrect responses, making previously wasted samples informative for gradient updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO wastes substantial compute on negative groups that yield zero advantage and no gradient, so the authors aim to leverage these negative groups without extra supervision.

Method: Starting from maximum-likelihood objective in reward modeling, they show MLE gradient is equivalent to policy gradient for modified value function that adds confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses (LENS).

Result: On MATH benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, LENS consistently outperforms GRPO baseline with significant gains on harder items.

Conclusion: LENS provides a principled and practical way to rescue negative groups, improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a standard
recipe for improving large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) widely used in practice. Yet GRPO
wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled
response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether
negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a
maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE
gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This
value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses,
imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as
\textbf{L}ikelihood \textbf{E}stimation with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{S}amples
(\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent
rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and
converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH
benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently
outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These
results demonstrate a principled and practical way to "rescue" negative groups,
improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

### [142] [Soft Graph Transformer for MIMO Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12694)
*Jiadong Hong,Lei Liu,Xinyu Bian,Wenjie Wang,Zhaoyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Soft Graph Transformer (SGT) is a neural architecture for MIMO detection that combines self-attention and graph-aware cross-attention to achieve near-ML performance with computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML detection is optimal but computationally infeasible for large systems, while conventional message-passing algorithms fail in finite dimensions. Existing Transformer-based detectors ignore MIMO factor graph structure and cannot use prior soft information.

Method: SGT combines self-attention (encoding contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs) with graph-aware cross-attention (structured message passing across subgraphs). It has a soft-input interface for integrating auxiliary priors and produces soft outputs.

Result: SGT achieves near-ML performance in experiments and maintains computational efficiency while providing effective soft outputs.

Conclusion: SGT offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that can leverage soft priors, addressing limitations of both ML detection and conventional approaches.

Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a soft-input-soft-output neural
architecture designed for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML)
detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it
infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely
on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent
Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the
MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT
addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes
contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with
graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across
subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors,
producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency.
Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a
flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft
priors.

### [143] [In-Context Learning for Non-Stationary MIMO Equalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08711)
*Jiachen Jiang,Zhen Qin,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates in-context learning for non-stationary channel equalization, proposing attention mechanisms inspired by classical adaptive algorithms to enhance adaptability in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ICL-based equalizers are limited to static channels within the context window, and prior theoretical studies focus exclusively on stationary settings. There's a need to extend ICL capabilities to handle time-varying channel equalization problems.

Method: The authors employ a principled framework for designing efficient attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity, leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing (e.g., LMS, LRMS, multi-step gradient updates) to guide better attention designs.

Result: Experimental results show that ICL holds strong promise for non-stationary MIMO equalization, and attention mechanisms inspired by classical adaptive algorithms substantially enhance adaptability and performance in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The findings provide critical insights for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger adaptability and robustness, demonstrating that ICL can effectively address non-stationary problems when properly designed.

Abstract: Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as
frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard
supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning
for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at
inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers
are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context
window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical
studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function
remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of
ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel
equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient
attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,
leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.
For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square
(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for
enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term
tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for
non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by
classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and
performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights
for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger
adaptability and robustness.

### [144] [A Frequency-Domain Analysis of the Multi-Armed Bandit Problem: A New Perspective on the Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08908)
*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a frequency-domain analysis framework for multi-armed bandit problems, interpreting reward estimates as spectral components and bandit algorithms as adaptive filters, providing new insights into the exploration-exploitation trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bandit analyses operate from time-domain and cumulative regret perspectives, struggling to characterize the dynamic learning process. A frequency-domain approach could provide better understanding of the exploration-exploitation dynamics.

Method: Reformulates the bandit process as a signal processing problem, viewing reward estimates as spectral components and uncertainty as frequency. Constructs a Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and proves equivalence between UCB's confidence bound and time-varying gain on uncertain spectral components.

Result: Proves that UCB's confidence bound is equivalent to a time-varying gain inversely proportional to the square root of visit count. Derives finite-time dynamic bounds for exploration rate decay.

Conclusion: The frequency-domain framework provides novel physical interpretation for classical algorithms and lays theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive parameter adjustment.

Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most
fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being
the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret
theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a
time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the
dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel
frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a
signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each
arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to
the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an
adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove
the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent
in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral
components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit
count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning
the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive
physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous
theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive
parameter adjustment.

TL;DR: Instance discrimination treats each dataset instance as a separate class and uses stochastic transformations to create different views, enabling the model to learn invariant representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To learn robust representations that are invariant to transformations by treating each instance as a unique class.

Method: Generate two different views of each instance through stochastic transformations and train the model to recognize the same instance across these views.

Result: The model learns representations that are invariant to the applied transformations, capturing the underlying object identity.

Conclusion: Instance discrimination is an effective self-supervised learning approach for learning transformation-invariant representations by treating instances as distinct classes.

Abstract: Instance discrimination is a self-supervised representation learning paradigm
wherein individual instances within a dataset are treated as distinct classes.
This is typically achieved by generating two disparate views of each instance
by applying stochastic transformations, which encourages the model to learn
representations that are invariant to the common underlying object across these
views.

### [146] [Locally Optimal Private Sampling: Beyond the Global Minimax](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09485)
*Hrad Ghoukasian,Bonwoo Lee,Shahab Asoodeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies local differential privacy (LDP) sampling, focusing on minimax risk around a fixed distribution P‚ÇÄ rather than global optimality. The authors characterize the exact local minimax risk and show it equals the global minimax risk when restricted to P‚ÇÄ's neighborhood.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on global minimax-optimality across distribution classes, but this paper takes a local perspective to better understand sampling performance around specific distributions, which naturally models private sampling with public data.

Method: Extend previous work from pure LDP to functional LDP framework, prove globally optimal functional LDP sampler yields optimal local sampler near P‚ÇÄ, and derive closed-form expression for locally minimax-optimal samplers.

Result: The local minimax risk equals global minimax risk when restricted to distributions near P‚ÇÄ, and the derived locally optimal sampler consistently outperforms global minimax samplers in empirical comparisons.

Conclusion: The local framework provides better performance for private sampling with public data, and the locally optimal sampler offers practical advantages over global methods while maintaining privacy guarantees.

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential
privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to
generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in
$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the
fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy
guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global
minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local
perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around
a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on
both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax
risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class
$\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,
we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP
framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler
yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.
Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the
locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of
$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models
private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is
represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally
optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it
consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CF-CP extends counterfactual fairness from point predictors to prediction sets using conformal prediction, ensuring fair uncertainty quantification while maintaining coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual fairness for prediction sets is underexplored, while standard conformal prediction doesn't ensure counterfactual fairness, creating a gap in fair decision-making under uncertainty.

Method: Symmetrization of conformity scores across protected-attribute interventions to create counterfactually fair prediction sets while preserving marginal coverage properties.

Result: CF-CP achieves counterfactual fairness and target coverage rates on both synthetic and real datasets across regression and classification tasks, with minimal increase in prediction set size.

Conclusion: CF-CP provides a simple, training-free approach for counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification, bridging the gap between fairness and conformal prediction.

Abstract: While counterfactual fairness of point predictors is well studied, its
extension to prediction sets--central to fair decision-making under
uncertainty--remains underexplored. On the other hand, conformal prediction
(CP) provides efficient, distribution-free, finite-sample valid prediction
sets, yet does not ensure counterfactual fairness. We close this gap by
developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces
counterfactually fair prediction sets. Through symmetrization of conformity
scores across protected-attribute interventions, we prove that CF-CP results in
counterfactually fair prediction sets while maintaining the marginal coverage
property. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that on both synthetic and
real datasets, across regression and classification tasks, CF-CP achieves the
desired counterfactual fairness and meets the target coverage rate with minimal
increase in prediction set size. CF-CP offers a simple, training-free route to
counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical foundation for controlling LLM behavior through internal state modifications, explaining how these interventions emerge from transformer computations and deriving principled methods for creating reusable weight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques for controlling LLM behavior through internal state modifications are guided by empirical heuristics without strong theoretical foundation, creating a need for principled understanding of how these interventions work.

Method: The authors generalize the theory of implicit weight updates to deep transformers, showing how prompt information is represented internally through weight vectors and matrices, and derive methods for condensing this into token-independent thought vectors and matrices.

Result: The paper provides theoretical explanations for existing vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offers a direct method for converting textual input into reusable weight updates.

Conclusion: The work establishes a theoretical foundation for inference-time model interventions and provides computationally-grounded methods for creating reusable steering mechanisms from textual inputs.

Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large
language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly
modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their
activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques,
while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving
steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work
provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they
emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture.
Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically
mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this
theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained
in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through
weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for
condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought
matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing
vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct,
computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable
weight updates.

*Justin Lin,Julia Fukuyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHAP analysis is used to explain black-box model predictions by clustering SHAP values, grouping samples that received the same predictions for similar reasons, and demonstrating this with simulated experiments and an Alzheimer's disease case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large black-box models lack explainability, making them untrustworthy in high-stakes situations. SHAP analysis addresses this by providing feature-level explanations for model predictions.

Method: Clustering SHAP values to group samples that received the same predictions for similar reasons, mapping various pathways to the same prediction. Includes simulated experiments and an Alzheimer's disease case study using ADNI data.

Result: The methodology successfully groups samples by prediction pathways, providing insights into how different samples arrive at the same prediction. A novel generalization of waterfall plot for multi-classification is presented.

Conclusion: Clustering SHAP values offers a powerful approach to understand black-box models by revealing the underlying reasons for predictions, enhancing model trustworthiness and interpretability in critical applications.

Abstract: In this growing age of data and technology, large black-box models are
becoming the norm due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data and learn
incredibly complex input-output relationships. The deficiency of these methods,
however, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them
untrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in
popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the
original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a
SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction
of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data
by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received
the same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various
pathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To
showcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a
case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We also present a novel generalization
of the waterfall plot for multi-classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dual-approach framework that improves explainability and forecastability of complex time series ensembles from AutoML systems like AutoGluon, using surrogate models for SHAP explanations and spectral predictability analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the transparency and interpretability challenges of complex ensemble models generated by AutoML systems, which deliver superior accuracy but lack explainability.

Method: 1) Surrogate-based explanation using LightGBM to mimic AutoGluon forecasts for SHAP feature attributions, validated through feature injection experiments. 2) Spectral predictability analysis to quantify series forecastability by comparing against noise benchmarks.

Result: Higher spectral predictability strongly correlates with improved forecast accuracy and higher surrogate fidelity. Per-item normalization is essential for meaningful SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series. Forecastability metrics serve as effective confidence scores.

Conclusion: The framework provides interpretable instance-level explanations for ensemble forecasts with forecastability metrics that indicate reliability of both predictions and their explanations.

Abstract: Modern time series forecasting increasingly relies on complex ensemble models
generated by AutoML systems like AutoGluon, delivering superior accuracy but
with significant costs to transparency and interpretability. This paper
introduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the
explainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles.
First, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the
accuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic
AutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature
attributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection
experiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP
values and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral
predictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By
comparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise
benchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in
forecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset
found that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with
improved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate
and the original forecasting model. These forecastability metrics serve as
effective filtering mechanisms and confidence scores, enabling users to
calibrate their trust in both the forecasts and their explanations. We further
demonstrated that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful
SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales. The
resulting framework delivers interpretable, instance-level explanations for
state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts, while equipping users with forecastability
metrics that serve as reliability indicators for both predictions and their
explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing in-context learning has limited success in molecular design, and labeled data for molecular properties remains scarce despite large databases like ChEMBL containing millions of biological assays.

Method: Uses demonstration-conditioned diffusion models with a small set of molecule-score examples as task contexts, guided by a denoising Transformer. Employs Node Pair Encoding tokenizer for motif-level molecular representation and scalable pretraining on curated dataset covering drugs and materials.

Result: Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses language models 100-1000x larger and achieves average rank of 3.63 compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches.

Conclusion: DemoDiff positions itself as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design, demonstrating superior performance with efficient molecular representation and scalable pretraining.

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few
demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing
databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of
biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address
this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models
(DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score
examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising
Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable
pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that
represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We
curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources
covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model
on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses
language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63
compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position
DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RFOD is a novel Random Forest-based outlier detection framework for tabular data that reframes anomaly detection as feature-wise conditional reconstruction, handling mixed data types while providing interpretable cell-level anomaly scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing outlier detection methods struggle with mixed-type tabular data, lose semantic information through encoding schemes, and lack interpretability for identifying specific anomalous values.

Method: RFOD trains dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on others, uses Adjusted Gower's Distance for cell-level scoring, and Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging to aggregate scores into row-level anomaly scores.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets show RFOD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy with superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability.

Conclusion: RFOD effectively addresses the challenges of mixed-type tabular outlier detection by preserving semantic integrity and providing interpretable results while achieving high detection performance.

Abstract: Outlier detection in tabular data is crucial for safeguarding data integrity
in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, financial fraud detection, and
healthcare, where anomalies can cause serious operational and economic impacts.
Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods
struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that
lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack
interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause
anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a
novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based
\textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for
tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD}
reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction
problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the
others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving
the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and
interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD)
for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for
categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate
cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments
on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering
superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular

*Christopher Yeh,Nicolas Christianson,Adam Wierman,Yisong Yue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for controlling tail risks and optimizing average-case performance in deep learning models through conformal risk training, extending beyond expected loss to broader risk measures like CVaR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models lack provable risk guarantees, which is critical for high-stakes applications. Existing conformal risk control methods only address expected loss and can degrade average-case performance due to lack of feedback during training.

Method: Developed conformal risk training - an end-to-end approach that differentiates through conformal Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risk control during model training or fine-tuning, enabling control of tail risks like CVaR.

Result: The method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches in applications like controlling classifiers' false negative rate and financial risk in battery storage operation.

Conclusion: Conformal risk training provides a practical framework for controlling tail risks in deep learning models while maintaining strong average-case performance, addressing limitations of existing post-hoc methods.

Abstract: While deep learning models often achieve high predictive accuracy, their
predictions typically do not come with any provable guarantees on risk or
reliability, which are critical for deployment in high-stakes applications. The
framework of conformal risk control (CRC) provides a distribution-free,
finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone
loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep
learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail
risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for
controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a
broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss
(generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the
conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can
degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To
address this, we introduce "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach
that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or
fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating
significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on
applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling
financial risk in battery storage operation.

### [154] [Exploring Cross-Client Memorization of Training Data in Large Language Models for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08750)
*Tinnakit Udsa,Can Udomcharoenchaikit,Patomporn Payoungkhamdee,Sarana Nutanong,Norrathep Rattanavipanon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for measuring fine-grained cross-sample memorization in federated learning, addressing both intra-client and inter-client memorization risks that existing FL detection methods overlook.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL memorization detection focuses on single samples and underestimates cross-sample risks, while centralized learning methods can't be directly applied to FL due to data decentralization.

Method: Proposed framework quantifies intra- and inter-client memorization using fine-grained cross-sample measurement across all clients, with studies on memorization patterns and influencing factors.

Result: FL models do memorize client data, with more memorization of intra-client data than inter-client data, influenced by training and inference factors like decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between centralized and federated learning memorization assessment, revealing significant cross-sample memorization risks in FL that require attention.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

*Mujin Kwun,Depen Morwani,Chloe Huangyuan Su,Stephanie Gil,Nikhil Anand,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOTION is a principled smoothing framework that optimizes neural networks for quantized objectives by approximating the quantized loss surface with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding noise, enabling guaranteed convergence to local minima while preserving global minima.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantized optimization is challenging due to piece-wise constant quantizers with zero gradients everywhere except at undefined thresholds. Existing methods like STE lack convergence guarantees.

Method: Introduces LOTION - Low-precision Optimization via Stochastic-noise smoothing, which replaces quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding noise, enabling standard optimizers to converge.

Result: Empirically outperforms standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M-parameter language models.

Conclusion: LOTION provides a principled smoothing framework that guarantees convergence to local minima while preserving global minima of the original quantized loss when using stochastic rounding noise.

Abstract: Optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives is fundamentally
challenging because the quantizer is piece-wise constant, yielding zero
gradients everywhere except at quantization thresholds where the derivative is
undefined. Most existing methods deal with this issue by relaxing gradient
computations with techniques like Straight Through Estimators (STE) and do not
provide any guarantees of convergence. In this work, taking inspiration from
Nesterov smoothing, we approximate the quantized loss surface with a continuous
loss surface. In particular, we introduce LOTION, \textbf{L}ow-precision
\textbf{O}ptimization via s\textbf{T}ochastic-no\textbf{I}se
sm\textbf{O}othi\textbf{N}g, a principled smoothing framework that replaces the
raw quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding
noise. In this framework, standard optimizers are guaranteed to converge to a
local minimum of the loss surface. Moreover, when using noise derived from
stochastic rounding, we show that the global minima of the original quantized
loss are preserved. We empirically demonstrate that this method outperforms
standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M- parameter language
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Spatial Deconfounder is a two-stage method that addresses both spatial confounding and interference by reconstructing latent confounders from local treatment vectors using a CVAE with spatial prior, then estimating causal effects through a flexible outcome model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial causal inference faces two key challenges: unmeasured spatial confounders (like weather or pollution) and treatment interference from nearby areas. Existing methods typically address only one issue while ignoring the other.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Use conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with spatial prior to reconstruct substitute confounder from local treatment vectors, (2) Estimate causal effects via flexible outcome model.

Result: Enables nonparametric identification of direct and spillover effects under weak assumptions, without requiring multiple treatment types or known latent field model. Empirical tests on extended SpaCE benchmark show consistent improvement in effect estimation across environmental health and social science datasets.

Conclusion: By leveraging interference as multi-cause signal, the framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures to advance robust causal inference in structured spatial data.

Abstract: Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1)
unmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that
confound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments
that violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods
typically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply
connected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging
this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that
reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates
causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables
nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak
assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the
latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial
confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial
Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets
in environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a
multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures
to advance robust causal inference in structured data.

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning approach using PPO agent combined with virtual imaging tools to optimize CT protocols, achieving global maximum detectability index with 79.7% fewer steps than exhaustive search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CT protocol optimization relies on exhaustive testing of parameter combinations, which is impractical due to complex interdependencies among acquisition and reconstruction parameters.

Method: Combined virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning using PPO agent to optimize CT parameters including tube voltage, tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size, maximizing detectability index of liver lesions.

Result: The reinforcement learning approach achieved the global maximum detectability index (d') across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality objectives, highlighting the potential of integrating virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

Abstract: Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high
diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the
complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters,
traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of
these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel
methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to
optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were
imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT
reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage,
tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The
optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically
the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images.
Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on
a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the
global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the
exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.
The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality
objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging
tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

*Francisco Pascoa,Ian Lalonde,Alexandre Girard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A zero-shot transfer method using Buckingham's Pi Theorem enables RL policies to generalize to new robots, tasks, and environments without retraining by scaling inputs and outputs through dimensionless space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL policies often fail to generalize to new robots, tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: Based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem, the method adapts pre-trained policies to new system contexts by scaling observations and actions through dimensionless space, requiring no retraining.

Result: The scaled transfer exhibits no performance loss on dynamically similar contexts and consistently outperforms naive transfer on non-similar contexts, significantly expanding the effective context volume.

Conclusion: Dimensional analysis provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and generalization of RL policies.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new robots,
tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, a challenge that
limits their real-world applicability. This paper presents a simple, zero-shot
transfer method based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem to address this limitation.
The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its
inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space,
requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer
baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated
pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the
high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer
exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore,
on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive
transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original
policy remains effective. These findings demonstrate that dimensional analysis
provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and
generalization of RL policies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces structure-aware text embeddings by integrating structural relations directly into LLM encoding, outperforming text-only and post-hoc methods across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM embeddings operate on raw text only, missing rich structural information like hyperlinks or citations that provide crucial context in real-world datasets.

Method: Two in-process methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching, plus Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing techniques to handle noisy structural data.

Result: Structure-aware approaches consistently outperform text-only and post-hoc baselines in zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: Provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually aware embedding models.

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

TL;DR: A framework that uses LLM-generated action recommendations through augmented observation spaces to guide RL exploration in sparse-reward environments, achieving significant performance improvements without algorithm modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL agents struggle in sparse-reward environments where traditional exploration fails, while LLMs possess procedural knowledge that could guide exploration but existing approaches create rigid dependencies.

Method: Provides LLM-generated action recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to learn when to follow or ignore guidance via soft constraints, requiring no modifications to existing RL algorithms.

Result: 71% relative improvement in final success rates over baseline in most challenging environment, with agents reaching performance thresholds up to 9 times faster across three BabyAI environments of increasing complexity.

Conclusion: The approach effectively leverages LLM planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments, with benefits scaling with task difficulty.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in sparse-reward
environments where traditional exploration strategies fail to discover
effective action sequences. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural
knowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL
exploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL
policies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward
functions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action
recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to
learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world
knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft
constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of
increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with
task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative
improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides
substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance
thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL
algorithms. Our results demonstrate an effective method for leveraging LLM
planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments.

*Xinwen Hu,Yunqing Huang,Nianyu Yi,Peimeng Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reusable initialization framework using basis function pretraining to improve neural network training efficiency, generalization, and transferability for function approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in neural function approximation: need for training from scratch for each target function, sensitivity to architecture/hyperparameters, and poor generalization beyond training domains.

Method: Pretrain basis neural networks on polynomial families in a reference domain, then use learned parameters to initialize networks for complex target functions. Includes domain mapping mechanism to transform inputs to reference domain.

Result: Extensive 1D and 2D experiments show substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization, and model transferability.

Conclusion: Initialization-based strategies show promise for scalable and modular neural function approximation.

Abstract: Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the
advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such
models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires
training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to
architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently
generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function
pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to
approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned
parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target
functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further
introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference
domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained
models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings
demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization,
and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based
strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full
code is made publicly available on Gitee.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies deceptive multi-armed bandits where an agent aims to identify the best private arm while appearing to follow Thompson Sampling based on public rewards, under KL divergence detectability constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model scenarios where agents need to optimize private objectives while maintaining plausible deniability about their true intentions, such as in strategic decision-making under observation.

Method: Formalizes detectability using stepwise KL divergence constraints, models public suboptimal arm pulls as a Bernoulli process with decreasing success probability, and proposes a maximin problem to characterize optimal error exponent.

Result: Shows that deceptive pulls of public suboptimal arms can occur at most at Œò(‚àöT) rate under KL constraints, and develops an algorithm that adapts exploration based on public suboptimality gaps.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively balances private reward optimization with detectability constraints, achieving the theoretical Œò(‚àöT) rate for deceptive arm pulls while maintaining plausible Thompson Sampling behavior.

Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit setting in which each arm has a public and a
private reward distribution. An observer expects an agent to follow Thompson
Sampling according to the public rewards, however, the deceptive agent aims to
quickly identify the best private arm without being noticed. The observer can
observe the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards.
The agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We
formalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
constraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the
anticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of
public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability
decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at
a $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin
problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the
optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose
an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts
its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public
suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the
$\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

Motivation: To develop an efficient framework for learning physically consistent solution operators for parametric PDEs that can handle varying inputs (parameters, initial/boundary conditions) while maintaining physical consistency through physics-informed constraints.

Method: Combines DeepONet architecture with CKAN sub-networks and integrates PINN principles to enforce physical consistency. Uses branch-trunk architecture with rational KAN modules and PDE residual loss for training.

Result: On Burgers' equation with ŒΩ=0.01, reduces mean relative L¬≤ error by ~48% compared to PI-DeepONet. Achieves competitive accuracy on Eikonal and diffusion-reaction benchmarks, closely matching high-fidelity solutions.

Conclusion: PO-CKAN provides an effective framework for accurate operator learning of parametric time-dependent PDEs, demonstrating significant improvements over existing physics-informed operator learning methods while maintaining physical consistency.

Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on
Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the
solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages
a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise
Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function
approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are
integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical
consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically
consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction
for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters,
initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark
problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely
matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk
architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and
enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers'
equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by
approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy
on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.

Conclusion: TAPAS datasets fill a critical gap in AI research on LWE attacks and provide foundation for future work in post-quantum cryptography analysis.

Abstract: AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), an important hard math
problem in post-quantum cryptography, rival or outperform "classical" attacks
on LWE under certain parameter settings. Despite the promise of this approach,
a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and

TL;DR: Edu-EmotionNet is a novel framework for emotion recognition in online education that jointly models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability through dynamic cross-modal attention, confidence-based weighting, and temporal consistency mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotion recognition methods use static fusion strategies and assume consistent modality reliability, which doesn't reflect real-world learning environments where modalities can be missing or noisy.

Method: Three key components: Cross-Modality Attention Alignment for dynamic context sharing, Modality Importance Estimator for confidence-based weighting per time step, and Temporal Feedback Loop for temporal consistency using previous predictions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI datasets, shows strong robustness to missing/noisy modalities, and visualizations confirm ability to capture emotional transitions and prioritize reliable signals.

Conclusion: The framework is well-suited for deployment in real-time learning systems due to its robust performance and adaptive modality handling.

Abstract: Understanding learner emotions in online education is critical for improving
engagement and personalized instruction. While prior work in emotion
recognition has explored multimodal fusion and temporal modeling, existing
methods often rely on static fusion strategies and assume that modality inputs
are consistently reliable, which is rarely the case in real-world learning
environments. We introduce Edu-EmotionNet, a novel framework that jointly
models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability for robust affect
recognition. Our model incorporates three key components: a Cross-Modality
Attention Alignment (CMAA) module for dynamic cross-modal context sharing, a
Modality Importance Estimator (MIE) that assigns confidence-based weights to
each modality at every time step, and a Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL) that
leverages previous predictions to enforce temporal consistency. Evaluated on
educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,
curiosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.
Visualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and
adaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in
real-time learning systems

TL;DR: Small transformer models can infer graph parameters from textual representations, and LoRA fine-tuning improves performance across metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether compact, resource-efficient language models can perform structural inference on graph data, which is typically handled by larger models.

Method: Created TinyGraphEstimator dataset with connected graphs and structural metadata, evaluated small open models on parameter prediction, and applied LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Small language models showed non-trivial reasoning capacity for graph inference tasks, with LoRA fine-tuning consistently improving all evaluated metrics.

Conclusion: Compact transformer models can effectively perform structural graph inference through efficient parameter adaptation like LoRA.

Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational
systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph
analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated
emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential
of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely
unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language
models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from textual graph
representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the
TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs
generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed
structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to
predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number.
Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated
metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial
reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted
for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.

TL;DR: A two-stage learning approach for long-tailed classification that uses information theory-based representation learning and informative sampling to address class imbalance bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data often has imbalanced distributions (long-tail) which causes deep classification models to be biased toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Information theory-based representation learning that minimizes intra-class distance for well-separated features, 2) Novel sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances to correct biased decision boundaries.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively mitigates majority-biased tendency in long-tailed classification while preserving valuable dataset information.

Abstract: The imbalance (or long-tail) is the nature of many real-world data
distributions, which often induces the undesirable bias of deep classification
models toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such
a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within
datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning
technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is
theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an
effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel
sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to
rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's
overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via
extensive experiments. Our code is available at

TL;DR: RL-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction in dynamic edge environments using cooperative Q-learning agents for camera and server selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is critical for edge applications like fire rescue, but dynamic edge resource availability causes disruptions that challenge reconstruction reliability.

Method: Two cooperative Q-learning agents (camera selection and server selection) that operate online and learn policies through interactions with edge environment, implemented on distributed testbed with lab devices and FABRIC infrastructure.

Result: The framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: RL-based resource management enables reliable 3D reconstruction in resource-constrained, disruption-prone edge environments by adaptively managing camera and server selection.

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability
introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links,
and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the
reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

*Thai-Hoang Pham,Jiayuan Chen,Seungyeon Lee,Yuanlong Wang,Sayoko Moroi,Xueru Zhang,Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairTTE is the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event prediction in medical imaging, addressing bias concerns in prognosis scenarios that have been overlooked in previous fairness research focused only on diagnosis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness approaches in medical imaging primarily focus on diagnosis tasks like classification and segmentation, while overlooking prognosis scenarios that predict disease progression over time. There's a critical gap in addressing potential biases in time-to-event prediction models used for medical prognosis.

Method: FairTTE integrates cutting-edge TTE prediction and fairness algorithms, using causal analysis techniques to uncover and quantify distinct sources of bias embedded within medical imaging datasets. The framework enables systematic and fine-grained analysis across diverse imaging modalities and TTE outcomes.

Result: Large-scale evaluation reveals pervasive bias across different imaging modalities, with current fairness methods offering limited mitigation. The study demonstrates strong association between underlying bias sources and model disparities, and shows fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts.

Conclusion: There is a pressing need for more robust, equitable prognostic models and holistic approaches that target all forms of bias, as existing solutions have significant limitations in maintaining fairness under real-world conditions and distribution shifts.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

### [170] [On the Alignment Between Supervised and Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08852)
*Achleshwar Luthra,Priyadarsi Mishra,Tomer Galanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the representation alignment between self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) and its supervised surrogate (NSCL), showing their representations remain similar throughout training despite parameter divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether CL and NSCL remain aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their objectives, given that previous theory showed loss-level similarity.

Method: Analyze representation alignment under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, augmentations), prove similarity matrices stay close, provide bounds on alignment metrics (CKA, RSA), and validate empirically.

Result: CL and NSCL representations remain similar with high-probability guarantees, alignment improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and depends on batch size, while parameter-space coupling is unstable.

Conclusion: NSCL serves as a principled bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning, with CL-NSCL alignment strengthening with scale and temperature.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical
success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on
downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss
closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised
Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this
loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain
aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their
objectives?}
  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL
models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and
augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain
similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL
stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability
guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and
representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment
improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch
size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently
unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with
training time.
  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL
alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more
closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled
bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning. Our code and project

### [171] [Time-Aware Feature Selection: Adaptive Temporal Masking for Stable Sparse Autoencoder Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08855)
*T. Ed Li,Junyu Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATM is a novel training method for sparse autoencoders that uses adaptive temporal masking to prevent feature absorption and improve feature interpretability in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAE training methods suffer from feature absorption where features merge to minimize L1 penalty, making it difficult to consistently identify and analyze model behaviors.

Method: ATM dynamically adjusts feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and reconstruction contributions to compute evolving importance scores, then applies probabilistic masking based on statistical thresholding.

Result: ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs while maintaining excellent reconstruction quality on the Gemma-2-2b model.

Conclusion: ATM provides a principled solution for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, establishing a foundation for more reliable model analysis.

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

*Ammar I Marvi,Nancy G Kanwisher,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sparse decomposition approach to analyze visual representations across brain streams and proposes Sparse Component Alignment (SCA) to measure brain-machine representational alignment with higher resolution than conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the inconsistency between distinct functional processes in human visual cortex streams and the surprising effectiveness of single-task DNNs in modeling the entire visual system, suggesting common computational principles.

Method: Applied novel sparse decomposition to identify dominant components in each visual stream, then introduced Sparse Component Alignment (SCA) method to measure representational alignment between brains and DNNs.

Result: Found clear differences in component response profiles across streams (faces, places, bodies in ventral; social interactions, motion in lateral; less interpretable in dorsal). SCA revealed DNNs are more aligned with ventral than dorsal/lateral representations.

Conclusion: SCA provides a more sensitive measure of representational alignment that captures latent neural tuning axes, offering greater resolution than conventional population-level geometry methods.

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational simulations, and multi-fidelity approaches can accelerate parameter space exploration, especially for binary simulation outputs.

Method: Introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI) which uses a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function to circumvent intractability of calculating mutual information in probability space.

Result: BPMI outperforms several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a real-world laser-ignited rocket combustor simulation, achieving higher predictive accuracy for fixed computational budgets.

Conclusion: BPMI demonstrates superior performance in all experiments, making it an effective approach for efficient simulation budget allocation in multi-fidelity GP classification problems.

Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational
simulations, where a multi-fidelity approach can accelerate the exploration of
a parameter space. We study efficient allocation of a simulation budget using a

intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by
employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI
against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world
application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In
all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher

*Mahdi Abavisani,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CNN-based unsupervised multimodal subspace clustering methods using encoder-decoder architecture with self-expressive layers for spatial and affinity fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective unsupervised multimodal subspace clustering methods that can fuse information from multiple modalities and learn meaningful representations for clustering.

Method: Three-stage framework: multimodal encoder (early/late/intermediate fusion), self-expressive layer for affinity matrix, and multimodal decoder for reconstruction. Also proposes affinity fusion where self-expressive layers across modalities are enforced to be identical.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets show the proposed methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art multimodal subspace clustering methods.

Conclusion: The CNN-based multimodal subspace clustering framework with various fusion strategies effectively learns cluster structures and achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We present convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches for
unsupervised multimodal subspace clustering. The proposed framework consists of
three main stages - multimodal encoder, self-expressive layer, and multimodal
decoder. The encoder takes multimodal data as input and fuses them to a latent
space representation. The self-expressive layer is responsible for enforcing
the self-expressiveness property and acquiring an affinity matrix corresponding
to the data points. The decoder reconstructs the original input data. The
network uses the distance between the decoder's reconstruction and the original
input in its training. We investigate early, late and intermediate fusion
techniques and propose three different encoders corresponding to them for
spatial fusion. The self-expressive layers and multimodal decoders are
essentially the same for different spatial fusion-based approaches. In addition
to various spatial fusion-based methods, an affinity fusion-based network is
also proposed in which the self-expressive layer corresponding to different
modalities is enforced to be the same. Extensive experiments on three datasets
show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art
multimodal subspace clustering methods.

### [175] [An Improved Model-Free Decision-Estimation Coefficient with Applications in Adversarial MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08882)
*Haolin Liu,Chen-Yu Wei,Julian Zimmert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Dig-DEC, a model-free decision-estimation coefficient that uses information gain for exploration instead of optimism, enabling adversarial environment handling and improved regret bounds for hybrid MDPs and Bellman-complete MDPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between regret bounds in DMSO and extend optimism-based approaches to adversarial settings, as previous DEC methods had limitations in model class size scaling and were restricted to stochastic environments.

Method: Proposes Dig-DEC which removes optimism and uses pure information gain for exploration. Improves online function estimation procedures with refined estimators and redesigned two-timescale procedures for better concentration and regret bounds.

Result: Dig-DEC is always smaller than optimistic DEC and handles adversarial environments. Achieves first model-free regret bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback. Improves regret bounds from T^{3/4} to T^{2/3} (on-policy), T^{5/6} to T^{7/9} (off-policy), and T^{2/3} to ‚àöT for Bellman-complete MDPs.

Conclusion: Dig-DEC provides a more general and efficient approach than optimistic DEC, enabling adversarial environment handling and achieving state-of-the-art regret bounds that match optimism-based methods in Bellman-complete MDPs.

Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work
(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the
decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper
and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this
gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that
scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their
optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and
it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.
  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives
exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than
optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the
removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without
explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic
transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret
bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition
structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).
  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free
learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in
Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret
bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$
(off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we
redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from
$T^{2/3}$ to $\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves
performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie
et al., 2023) in Bellman-complete MDPs.

TL;DR: ACPO is a phased framework that improves RLVR by balancing exploration and exploitation through difficulty-aware curriculum, trajectory segmentation, and factorized rewards for better credit assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods struggle with balancing exploration and exploitation, leading to inaccurate credit assignment for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse that limits model performance.

Method: ACPO uses a phased framework with difficulty-aware curriculum, trajectory semantic segmentation, attribution-based representation to regulate policy entropy, and factorized reward system for hierarchical step contribution quantification.

Result: Extensive experiments on AIME, MATH, and AMC benchmarks show ACPO significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: ACPO effectively addresses exploration-exploitation balance in RLVR through its phased framework and attribution-based methods, achieving superior performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances complex
reasoning in LLMs, current methods struggle to balance exploration and
exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment
for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model
performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to
Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a
difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory
semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically
regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it
enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies
the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit
assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: Address AoI deterioration caused by packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in SPS for IoV applications.

Method: Establishes AoI calculation model considering vehicle speed, density and RRI, then designs dual-path optimization scheme combining DDPG (guided by state space and reward function) and LLM (using contextual learning for parameter optimization).

Result: LLM significantly reduces AoI after accumulating few exemplars without training, while DDPG achieves more stable performance after training.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-DDPG approach effectively addresses AoI deterioration in IoV SPS systems, with LLM providing quick optimization and DDPG offering stable performance.

Abstract: Addressing the problem of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration caused by
packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), this
letter proposes an optimization approach based on Large Language Models (LLM)
and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). First, an AoI calculation model
influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval
(RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization
scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the
LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations.
Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after
accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training,
whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

TL;DR: A simple and robust approach for spatiotemporal forecasting of small Earth data by characterizing spatiotemporal patterns and using tabular foundation models, achieving superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Earth data with limited short-term monitoring variability are crucial for understanding geoscientific processes, but conventional deep learning models require task-specific training while foundation models exhibit forecasting bias toward global means.

Method: Characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of small Earth data, then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate forecasting across different scenarios.

Result: Superior accuracy compared to graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular foundation model (TabPFN) in majority of instances across three typical scenarios, with stronger robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an effective solution for spatiotemporal forecasting of small Earth data without task-specific training requirements, overcoming biases in existing foundation models.

Abstract: Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term
monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically
exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data
is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale.
However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting
requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do
not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward
the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and
robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting.
The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of
small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate
forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three
typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior
accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular
foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger
robustness.

TL;DR: AB-PINNs introduce adaptive domain decomposition for physics-informed neural networks, where subdomains dynamically adjust to solution features and new subdomains are added in high-loss regions during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in training PINNs for multiscale problems and prevent convergence to local minima, while reducing the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static domain decomposition methods.

Method: Dynamic domain decomposition where existing subdomains adapt to solution features and new subdomains are introduced on-the-fly in regions of high residual loss during training, inspired by classical mesh refinement techniques.

Result: Comprehensive numerical results demonstrate AB-PINNs effectively solve various complex multiscale partial differential equations.

Conclusion: AB-PINNs provide a flexible domain decomposition approach well-suited for multiscale problems, enabling different subdomains to capture different scales of the solution and improving training convergence.

Abstract: We introduce adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs), a
novel approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs in which existing
subdomains dynamically adapt to the intrinsic features of the unknown solution.
Drawing inspiration from classical mesh refinement techniques, we also modify
the domain decomposition on-the-fly throughout training by introducing new
subdomains in regions of high residual loss, thereby providing additional
expressive power where the solution of the differential equation is challenging
to represent. Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for
multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different
scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new
subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima
and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static
domain decomposition approaches. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical
results which demonstrate the effectiveness of AB-PINNs at solving a variety of
complex multiscale partial differential equations.

*Moyu Zhang,Yun Chen,Yujun Jin,Jinxin Hu,Yu Zhang,Xiaoyi Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MATT is a model-agnostic test-time paradigm that uses confidence scores of feature combinations to generate multiple inference paths, mitigating low-confidence feature effects and improving CTR prediction robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous CTR research focused on training phase optimization but neglected inference phase opportunities. Infrequent feature combinations degrade prediction performance, leading to unreliable outputs.

Method: Proposes hierarchical probabilistic hashing to estimate feature combination frequencies as confidence scores, then uses these scores as sampling probabilities to generate multiple instance-specific inference paths through iterative sampling, aggregating predictions for robust outputs.

Result: Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate MATT's compatibility and effectiveness across existing CTR models.

Conclusion: MATT successfully unlocks the predictive potential of trained CTR models by optimizing inference phase performance through confidence-guided multiple path generation and aggregation.

Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR
model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training
objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive
performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training
phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference
phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade
prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To
unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a
Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores
of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths,
thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final
prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations,
we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the
occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve
as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as
sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths
through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores
from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline
experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and
effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework that adaptively adjusts KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for better uncertainty calibration in Evidence Deep Learning, addressing limitations of static hyperparameters in dynamic data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EDL methods use static hyperparameters for uncertainty calibration, which limits adaptability to dynamic data distributions and results in poor calibration and generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks.

Method: MPC employs bi-level optimization: inner loop updates model parameters with dynamically configured loss function; outer loop uses policy network to optimize KL divergence coefficient and class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality.

Result: Extensive experiments show MPC significantly enhances reliability and calibration of model predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

Conclusion: The learnable Dirichlet prior in MPC enables flexible adaptation to class distributions and training dynamics, overcoming limitations of fixed priors in traditional EDL methods and providing better uncertainty modeling for high-risk applications.

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static
hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in
dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and
generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework
that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for
optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction
accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

TL;DR: VARNN is a novel neural network architecture that uses error memory from recent prediction residuals to recalibrate predictions, improving robustness in non-stationary time series with regime shifts and heteroscedastic noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time series exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts, and temporally varying noise that degrade standard regression models' robustness.

Method: VARNN augments a feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state updated from residuals over short context steps, using this as a signal of variability and drift to condition final predictions.

Result: VARNN achieves superior performance across diverse domains (appliance energy, healthcare, environmental monitoring), attaining lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static, dynamic, and recurrent baselines.

Conclusion: VARNN offers robust predictions under drift and volatility environments, showing potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

Abstract: Real-world time series data exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts,
and temporally varying noise (heteroscedastic) that degrade the robustness of
standard regression models. We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural
Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series
regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction
residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a
feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from
residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and
then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse
dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring,
experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and
attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static,
dynamic, and recurrent baselines. Our findings show that the VARNN model offers
robust predictions under a drift and volatility environment, highlighting its
potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LAGA is a multi-agent framework that addresses graph quality issues in Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) through automated detection, planning, action, and evaluation agents, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks (GNNs) on TAGs are highly sensitive to input quality, suffering significant degradation from sparsity, noise, and imbalance. Existing approaches focus on model architectures while neglecting systematic optimization of TAG data itself.

Method: LAGA integrates four collaborative agents: detection, planning, action, and evaluation in an automated closed loop. The action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective design to capture complementary information across modalities for holistic graph quality enhancement.

Result: Experiments across nine scenarios show LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and backbones.

Conclusion: Data-centric quality optimization is key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning, validating the importance of treating graph quality control as a first-class problem.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that
combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide
range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical
study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant
degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and
imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing
approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting
systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in
practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph
Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a
first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative
agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed
loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective
design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform
holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that
LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as
key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.

TL;DR: HiBBO is a Bayesian Optimization framework that uses HiPPO-enhanced VAEs to reduce functional distribution mismatch in high-dimensional spaces, outperforming existing VAE-BO methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard VAE-based BO methods suffer from functional distribution mismatch between latent and original spaces due to reconstruction-only objectives, limiting optimization performance in high dimensions.

Method: Proposes HiBBO framework that incorporates space consistency into VAE latent space construction using HiPPO (long-term sequence modeling) to align functional distributions between latent and original spaces.

Result: Experiments on high-dimensional benchmarks show HiBBO achieves better convergence speed and solution quality compared to existing VAE-BO methods.

Conclusion: HiBBO successfully bridges high-dimensional sequence representation learning with efficient Bayesian Optimization, enabling applications in neural architecture search and materials science.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive
blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces
due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional
latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings
the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original
space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first
analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution
mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space
consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method
for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution
mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on
highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing
VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the
gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient
Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture
search materials science and beyond.

*Suraj Kumar Sahoo,Narayanan C Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learned Optimizers can internalize regularization effects without explicit application, outperforming unregularized counterparts in generalization and test accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether regularizers can be learned by LOs rather than explicitly applied, challenging conventional optimization approaches.

Method: Train LOs with and without access to explicit regularizers (SAM, GAM, GSAM) and compare performance on standard benchmarks including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR with MLP, MLP-Relu, and CNN architectures.

Result: Regularized LOs consistently outperform unregularized ones in test accuracy and generalization, and can transfer regularization effects to new tasks by seeking minima similar to those targeted by explicit regularizers.

Conclusion: LOs can inherently learn regularization properties, questioning the necessity of explicit regularization in optimization tasks.

Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due
to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization.
Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization
techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware
Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to
enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental
question: \textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that
LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional
regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective
function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
(including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and
CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers.
Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in
terms of test accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, we show that LOs retain
and transfer these regularization effects to new optimization tasks by
inherently seeking minima similar to those targeted by these regularizers. Our
results suggest that LOs can inherently learn regularization properties,
\textit{challenging the conventional necessity of explicit optimizee loss
regularization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLER (reinforcement learning with ensembled rewards) addresses system bias in RLIR by aggregating diverse models and adapting reward interpolation, achieving performance close to RLVR in unlabeled settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLIR enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings but suffers from performance and stability issues due to system bias where models overestimate high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased reward estimation and unstable training.

Method: Proposed RLER which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward interpolation and rollout selection to mitigate system bias characterized by three metrics: œÅ_noise, œÅ_selfbias, and œÅ_symbias.

Result: RLER improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable scaling on unlabeled samples.

Conclusion: RLER effectively addresses the system bias in RLIR, making it highly applicable for stable reinforcement learning scaling in unlabeled settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedL2T is a personalized federated learning framework for seizure prediction that uses two-teacher knowledge distillation to handle inter-patient variability and data heterogeneity across clients, achieving superior performance with privacy preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep learning models for seizure prediction requires large EEG datasets, but acquiring labeled EEG data is challenging due to annotation costs and privacy concerns. Existing FL methods struggle with inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes FedL2T with two-teacher knowledge distillation: each client learns from both a global model and a dynamically assigned peer model. Uses adaptive multi-level distillation aligning prediction outputs and feature representations, plus proximal regularization for training stability.

Result: Extensive experiments on two EEG datasets show FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods, especially under low-label conditions. Achieves rapid and stable convergence, reducing communication rounds and overhead.

Conclusion: FedL2T demonstrates strong potential as a reliable and personalized solution for seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios, effectively handling client heterogeneity while preserving data privacy.

Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large
amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient
labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints.
Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by
sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent
inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure
prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous
client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized
federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge
distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client.
Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated
model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched
knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an
adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs
and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition,
a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model
updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG
datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL
methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits
rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the
number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results
underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for
seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T) is a framework that uses (intent, constraint) pairs to guide Monte Carlo Tree Search, improving LLM planning by focusing on semantically meaningful paths while satisfying symbolic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with multi-step planning alignment to user intent and symbolic constraints in complex domains. Existing methods like CoT and ToT expand search space but often produce infeasible actions or hallucinated steps.

Method: Proposes Const-o-T framework using (intent, constraint) pairs to structure reasoning steps, integrated with MCTS to prune infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions.

Result: Outperforms baselines across Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning domains, achieving higher accuracy and stronger structural alignment.

Conclusion: Const-o-T provides a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

Abstract: While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language
models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that
those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints,
especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such
as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented
methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or
hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured
prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically
meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint)
pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity.
Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs
post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search
toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a
structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune
infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions,
improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate
across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning
that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger
structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers
a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more
efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HW-NAS methods are impractical for real-world deployment due to high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex energy behavior.

Method: PlatformX integrates four key components: energy-driven search space, transferable kernel-level energy predictor, Pareto-based multi-objective search algorithm, and automated high-resolution runtime energy profiling system.

Result: PlatformX significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy fidelity, identifying models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ per inference, outperforming MobileNet-V2 in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: PlatformX provides a fully automated and transferable HW-NAS framework that enables practical deployment of efficient DNNs across diverse edge devices while maintaining high accuracy and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful
tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge
devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world
deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor
scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific
energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and
transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX
integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands
conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,
enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable
kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with
minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search
algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and
(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device
power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We
evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it
significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy
fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ
per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code

TL;DR: A unified framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian variational learning achieves higher compression rates than existing methods while maintaining comparable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on resource-constrained devices, but existing methods using pruning or quantization individually result in suboptimal compression rates.

Method: Uses Bayesian variational learning with spike-and-slab prior for sparsity and Gaussian Mixture Models for quantized weights, enabling simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization.

Result: Achieves higher compression rates than existing methods on ResNet, BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models with comparable performance drops.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework provides an effective approach for neural network compression through simultaneous pruning and quantization.

Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on
resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or
low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression
rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified
framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian
variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior
baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a
spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we
provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse
and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet,
BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher
compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance
drops.

*Changsheng Wang,Yihua Zhang,Dennis Wei,Jinghan Jia,Pin-Yu Chen,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM unlearning remains robust even with noisy forget data, as algorithms rely on deep semantic cues rather than surface-level patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ethical concerns about LLMs memorizing sensitive data and producing harmful content, especially when forget data is low-quality or synthetically rewritten in real-world scenarios.

Method: Systematically benchmark state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods (RMU and NPO) on noisy forget sets with various perturbations while preserving core semantic signals.

Result: Unlearning shows surprising robustness to data perturbations as long as key semantic components are preserved, with saliency analysis revealing consistent influence of semantic drivers despite surface variations.

Conclusion: LLM unlearning algorithms are guided primarily by deep semantic cues rather than shallow lexical patterns, making them reliable even with imperfect forget data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but
raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing
biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM
unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data
from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean,
well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be
low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the
reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning
under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets.
By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and
NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly
robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To
explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key
semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential
despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning
algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow
lexical patterns.

*Rui Bu,Haofeng Zhong,Wenzheng Chen,Yangyan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VGA (Value-State Gated Attention) is proposed to address extreme-token phenomena like attention sinks and value-state drains in Transformers by using a learnable gate computed from value vectors to modulate attention output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models suffer from attention sinks and value-state drains that degrade performance, quantization fidelity, and interpretability due to a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where models learn inefficient 'no-op' behavior.

Method: VGA introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate computed directly from value vectors (V) to modulate attention output, breaking the cycle by gating value-state with a function of itself rather than input embeddings.

Result: VGA significantly mitigates attention sinks and stabilizes value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

Conclusion: Gating value-state with a function of itself is more effective than prior methods for decoupling value and attention score updates, creating a direct regulatory pathway to suppress problematic token contributions.

Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to
extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These
issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and
interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where
the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on
tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated
Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for
performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA
introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value
vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the
underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of
itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than
prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory
pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its
emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA
significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes
value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization
fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

TL;DR: Slim Scheduler is a hybrid scheduling framework that combines PPO reinforcement learning with greedy schedulers to dynamically coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models, achieving significant reductions in latency and energy consumption while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most neural network scheduling research focuses on static, end-to-end models of fixed width, overlooking dynamic approaches that adapt to heterogeneous hardware and fluctuating runtime conditions.

Method: A hybrid framework integrating PPO reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic greedy schedulers. Local greedy schedulers batch compatible requests and manage instance scaling, while PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio, and batch configuration.

Result: Achieved 96.45% reduction in mean latency and 97.31% reduction in energy usage when dropping to slimmest model (70.3% accuracy). Can also reduce average latency plus energy consumption with increased accuracy at cost of higher standard deviations.

Conclusion: The hierarchical design reduces search space complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency and throughput for dynamic neural network scheduling.

Abstract: Most neural network scheduling research focuses on optimizing static,
end-to-end models of fixed width, overlooking dynamic approaches that adapt to
heterogeneous hardware and fluctuating runtime conditions. We present Slim
Scheduler, a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic, greedy
schedulers to coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models. Each
server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and
manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the
PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio,
and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space
complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency
and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline,
Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A
96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage
dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then
accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with
an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said
latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.

TL;DR: MagicDock is a framework for de novo ligand design that addresses limitations of existing methods through gradient inversion and differentiable surface modeling, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing de novo ligand design methods suffer from Pseudo De Novo approaches, limited docking modeling, and inflexible ligand types, which restrict their practical applicability in biomedical applications.

Method: Uses a gradient inversion framework with binding prediction to guide ligand generation, differentiable surface modeling with learnable 3D point-cloud representations, and customized designs for different ligand types integrated into a unified framework.

Result: Achieves average improvements of 27.1% and 11.7% over state-of-the-art baselines for protein and molecule ligand design respectively across 9 scenarios.

Conclusion: MagicDock provides a comprehensive solution for de novo ligand design with theoretical guarantees and demonstrates superior performance compared to specialized baselines.

Abstract: De novo ligand design is a fundamental task that seeks to generate protein or
molecule candidates that can effectively dock with protein receptors and
achieve strong binding affinity entirely from scratch. It holds paramount
significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most
existing studies are constrained by the \textbf{Pseudo De Novo},
\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To
address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework
grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1)
We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general
docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone
model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient
flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of
ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking
process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely
capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve
docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We
introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into
a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring
broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for
each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios
demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\% and 11.7\%
over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design,
respectively.

Method: Estimate environmental impacts of training notable AI systems over the last decade, focusing on the life cycle of graphics cards and considering reduction strategies like location shifting.

Result: Two critical trends: 1) Graphics card production impacts have steadily increased, 2) Energy consumption and environmental impacts have increased exponentially despite optimization strategies, showing rebound effects.

Conclusion: Increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure sustainability in ML; mitigating environmental impact requires reducing AI activities and questioning the scale/frequency of resource-intensive training, while considering hardware impacts over entire life cycle.

Abstract: Recent Machine Learning (ML) approaches have shown increased performance on
benchmarks but at the cost of escalating computational demands. Hardware,
algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy
consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable
ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with
training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language
Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals
two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have
increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and
environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased
exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location
shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization
strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing
rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over
the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact
shifting. Our study demonstrates that increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure
sustainability in ML. Mitigating the environmental impact of AI also requires
reducing AI activities and questioning the scale and frequency of
resource-intensive training.

### [197] [The Attacker Moves Second: Stronger Adaptive Attacks Bypass Defenses Against Llm Jailbreaks and Prompt Injections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09023)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current evaluations of language model defenses are flawed. Adaptive attackers using optimized methods can bypass most existing defenses with high success rates, even those originally reporting near-zero attack success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that current evaluation methods for language model defenses are inadequate and that defenses must be tested against stronger, adaptive attackers.

Method: Systematically tuned and scaled general optimization techniques including gradient descent, reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration to attack 12 recent defenses.

Result: Successfully bypassed 12 recent defenses with attack success rates above 90% for most defenses, despite original reports of near-zero attack success rates.

Conclusion: Future defense work must consider stronger adaptive attacks to make reliable claims of robustness, as current evaluation methods are insufficient.

Abstract: How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current
defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an
attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious
actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of
harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods
that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation
process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who
explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while
spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically
tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent,
reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass
12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success
rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally
reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work
must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make
reliable and convincing claims of robustness.

### [198] [Convergence of optimizers implies eigenvalues filtering at equilibrium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09034)
*Jerome Bolte,Quoc-Tung Le,Edouard Pauwels*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Different optimizers act as eigenvalue filters that determine which minima are found during neural network training, with gradient descent avoiding sharp minima and SAM favoring wider basins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why different optimizers converge to different types of minima in deep neural network training, particularly focusing on their eigenvalue filtering properties.

Method: Theoretical analysis using generalized Hadamard-Perron stable manifold theorem applied to general semialgebraic C¬≤ functions, plus numerical experiments on feed-forward neural networks.

Result: Standard gradient descent inherently avoids sharpest minima, while SAM algorithms actively favor wider basins. Two novel algorithms with enhanced eigenvalue filtering are proposed.

Conclusion: Optimizers can be understood as eigenvalue filters determined by their hyperparameters, providing insights into their convergence behavior and enabling the design of algorithms that promote wider minima.

Abstract: Ample empirical evidence in deep neural network training suggests that a
variety of optimizers tend to find nearly global optima. In this article, we
adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is
assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption.
From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability
phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue
filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard
gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively
favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel
algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting
wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron
stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions,
without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz
bound assumptions. We support our conclusions with numerical experiments on
feed-forward neural networks.

*Junchao Fan,Xiaolin Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IGCARL is a robust autonomous driving approach that uses strategic targeted adversaries to induce safety-critical events and trains driving agents with constrained optimization to improve robustness against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robust DRL methods for autonomous driving suffer from myopic adversarial attacks, inability to cause truly safety-critical events, and learning instability due to lack of robust constraints.

Method: Proposes IGCARL with two components: (1) strategic targeted adversary that performs coordinated multi-step attacks using general-sum objectives to induce safety-critical events, and (2) robust driving agent trained with constrained optimization to ensure stable learning.

Result: IGCARL improves success rate by at least 27.9% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to adversarial attacks and enhanced safety/reliability.

Conclusion: IGCARL effectively addresses key limitations of existing robust DRL methods for autonomous driving by combining strategic adversarial training with constrained optimization, significantly improving robustness against sophisticated attacks.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to
adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.
Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from
three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial
attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)
they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but
instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can
introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack
of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent
General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel
robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted
adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is
designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to
execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it
explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum
objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to
develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To
ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift
caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.
Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least
27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to
adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based
autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transportation is a major greenhouse gas emitter, requiring transition to EVs, but uneven charging infrastructure distribution and utilization challenges grid stability and investment planning.

Method: TW-GCN spatio-temporal forecasting framework combining Graph Convolutional Networks with temporal architectures, using real-world traffic flows, weather conditions, and proprietary EV infrastructure data from a major US company.

Result: Mid-horizon (3-hour) forecasts achieve best balance between responsiveness and stability, with 1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows predictive accuracy disparities across East, Middle, and West Tennessee based on station density, population, and local demand variability.

Conclusion: TW-GCN framework advances integration of data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

Abstract: Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,
highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such
as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular
utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid
stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a
spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional
Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in
Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather
conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV
infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and
temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons,
clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour)
forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with
1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows
disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee,
reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape
model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of
data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both
sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

TL;DR: Integration of segmentation techniques with heterogeneous ensembles improves anomaly detection in industrial production, boosting AUC-ROC from 0.8599 to 0.9760.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance anomaly detection in industrial production by reducing temporal uncertainty and improving detection of transitions between normal and anomalous conditions.

Method: Used segmentation (Change Point Detection with ChangeFinder) as pre-processing step before applying heterogeneous ensemble algorithms (Random Forest and XGBoost).

Result: Significant improvement in AUC-ROC metric from 0.8599 (PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (Random Forest and XGBoost with segmentation).

Conclusion: Segmentation reduces temporal ambiguity and facilitates supervised learning, providing significant advantage for anomaly detection in industrial contexts.

Abstract: Concerning machine learning, segmentation models can identify state changes
within time series, facilitating the detection of transitions between normal
and anomalous conditions. Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection
(CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully
applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing
temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we
explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a
heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial
production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a
pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided
a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from
0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random
Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of
segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process
of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit
of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points,
combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further
optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BioCodec is a representation learning framework that uses neural codec-inspired discrete tokenization to process noisy biosignals like EEG and EMG, showing strong performance across multiple downstream tasks in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG and other biosignals are high-dimensional and noisy, requiring extensive preprocessing. Current foundation models face challenges in biosignal applications, so an alternative representation learning approach is needed.

Method: BioCodec framework inspired by neural codecs, pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours to capture low-level signal characteristics as discrete tokens. Uses codebook embeddings and analyzes spatial coherence from EEG connectivity.

Result: Effective across clinical diagnostics, sleep physiology, speech decoding, and motor imagery tasks, especially in low-resource settings. Also works with EMG signals. Performs competitively with state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: BioCodec provides a versatile biosignal tokenization solution that addresses challenges in foundation model applications for noisy physiological data, with competitive performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer
accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity
for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive
entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy
time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and
handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently,
there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning
techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and
interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such
methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning
framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics
in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec
shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical
diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery,
particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative
analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook
embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of
our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.
Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal
tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The
source code and model checkpoints are shared.

TL;DR: AdaPM is an adaptive training strategy that uses partial momentum with bias correction to reduce memory usage by over 90% while maintaining performance in large language model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Momentum optimization is widely used in LLM training for acceleration but presents significant memory challenges due to storage requirements.

Method: Proposes AdaPM with non-uniform momentum design where full momentum is not needed for most blocks, enhanced by bias correction technique to mitigate performance loss from partial momentum.

Result: Reduces memory by over 90% in momentum while maintaining efficiency and performance across models from 60M to 1.5B parameters, including pretraining, fine-tuning, and RLHF. Combined with other techniques, achieves up to 95% memory reduction in optimizer states and saves over 30% GPU hours for GPT-2 1.5B.

Conclusion: AdaPM provides an effective memory-efficient optimization approach that significantly reduces memory usage while preserving training performance across various LLM training scenarios.

Abstract: In the training of large language models, momentum is widely used and often
demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration. However, storing momentum
typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an
adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a
memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum
design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the
performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate
the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the
partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that
our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both
efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from
60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further
reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the
memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$
GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.

Result: Achieves better accuracy than existing adversarial training methods on datasets like CIFAR-10 while maintaining strong robustness against attacks.

Conclusion: MemLoss provides an effective approach to improve adversarial training by reusing adversarial examples, achieving better balance between natural accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach called MemLoss to improve the
adversarial training of machine learning models. MemLoss leverages previously
generated adversarial examples, referred to as 'Memory Adversarial Examples,'
to enhance model robustness and accuracy without compromising performance on
clean data. By using these examples across training epochs, MemLoss provides a

*Zhi Yang,Changwu Huang,Ke Tang,Xin Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the underexplored issue of fairness in privacy protection across groups in differentially private machine learning (DPML), proposing a novel membership inference game for efficient worst-case privacy risk auditing and an enhanced DP-SGD algorithm with adaptive group-specific gradient clipping to reduce privacy risk disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assess group privacy risks based on average-case privacy risks, which may underestimate group privacy risks and disparities. Current worst-case privacy risk assessment methods are time-consuming and impractical.

Method: Introduced a membership inference game for efficient auditing of approximate worst-case privacy risks, and enhanced DP-SGD with adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy inspired by differential privacy auditing canaries.

Result: Experimental results show the method provides more stringent measurement of group privacy risks and reliable assessment of disparity. The enhanced algorithm effectively reduces disparity in group privacy risks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances fairness of privacy protection in DPML by providing better group privacy risk assessment and reducing privacy risk disparities through adaptive group-specific mechanisms.

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware
machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of
privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have
proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the
average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate
the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity
across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the
worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their
practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case
privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a
reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to
promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD
algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired
by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive
experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in
group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in
DPML.

*Orin Levy,Liad Erez,Alon Cohen,Yishay Mansour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Regret minimization algorithms for contextual multi-armed bandits with adversarial delayed feedback, achieving optimal bounds for finite policy classes and general bounds for function approximation settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of delayed feedback in contextual bandits where loss observations arrive with adversarial delays, which is common in real-world applications like online advertising and recommendation systems.

Method: Two approaches: (1) For finite policy classes, direct access method; (2) For general function approximation, using online least-square regression oracle with FIFO order and Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating forecaster.

Result: Achieved expected regret bounds: O(‚àö(KT log|Œ†|) + ‚àö(D log|Œ†|)) for finite policy classes, and O(‚àö(KT R_T(O)) + ‚àö(d_max D Œ≤)) for general function approximation, with Œ≤ ‚â§ log|F| for finite function classes.

Conclusion: The algorithms provide near-optimal regret bounds for contextual bandits with adversarial delays, with a ‚àöd_max factor gap from the lower bound for general function approximation settings.

Abstract: We present regret minimization algorithms for the contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problem over $K$ actions in the presence of delayed feedback, a
scenario where loss observations arrive with delays chosen by an adversary. As
a preliminary result, assuming direct access to a finite policy class $\Pi$ we
establish an optimal expected regret bound of $ O (\sqrt{KT \log |\Pi|} +
\sqrt{D \log |\Pi|)} $ where $D$ is the sum of delays. For our main
contribution, we study the general function approximation setting over a
(possibly infinite) contextual loss function class $ \mathcal{F} $ with access
to an online least-square regression oracle $\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathcal{F}$.
In this setting, we achieve an expected regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{KT\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})} + \sqrt{ d_{\max} D \beta})$ assuming
FIFO order, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximal delay, $\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})$
is an upper bound on the oracle's regret and $\beta$ is a stability parameter
associated with the oracle. We complement this general result by presenting a
novel stability analysis of a Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating
forecaster as an oracle implementation for least-square regression over a
finite function class $\mathcal{F}$ and show that its stability parameter
$\beta$ is bounded by $\log |\mathcal{F}|$, resulting in an expected regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{d_{\max} D \log
|\mathcal{F}|})$ which is a $\sqrt{d_{\max}}$ factor away from the lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ that we
also present.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for density estimation from pairwise comparisons by relating the target density to a tempered winner density, learning the winner's score via score-matching, and then 'de-tempering' to estimate the target density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by expert knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback, where direct density estimation from pairwise comparisons is needed.

Method: The method relates unobserved target density to tempered winner density, learns winner's score via score-matching, and estimates target by 'de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score. Uses diffusion models trained on tempered samples generated via score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics.

Result: The approach can learn complex multivariate belief densities of simulated experts from only hundreds to thousands of pairwise comparisons.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables effective density estimation from pairwise comparison data by leveraging score-matching and tempering/de-tempering techniques.

Abstract: We study density estimation from pairwise comparisons, motivated by expert
knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback. We relate the
unobserved target density to a tempered winner density (marginal density of
preferred choices), learning the winner's score via score-matching. This allows
estimating the target by `de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score.
We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are
collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical
formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry
model. Using a diffusion model trained on tempered samples generated via
score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics, we can learn complex multivariate
belief densities of simulated experts, from only hundreds to thousands of
pairwise comparisons.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Logits Replay + MoClip: A two-stage framework for efficient LLM domain adaptation that compresses supervision via dynamic Top-K token subsets and stabilizes optimization with gradient-momentum control, reducing training costs by 40% while maintaining generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off in LLM post-training where domain improvements come at the expense of general capabilities, and overcome limitations of existing methods that impose significant computational, data access, or adaptability costs.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage 0 records dynamic Top-K token subsets covering probability threshold (including gold label); Stage 1 replays compact subsets for exact renormalized losses. MoClip optimizer caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies arctan2-based rescaling for stability.

Result: Improves domain performance on Communication Technology and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), with over 40% reduction in training cost.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, architecture-agnostic path for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training:
improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general
capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via
regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each
imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent
work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits
without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation.
However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.
  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses
supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level.
In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability
threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact
subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation
and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an
optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based
rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on
Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on
general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over
40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path
for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.

pre-constructed knowledge bases that suffer from coverage gaps and temporal
obsolescence, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic information environments.
We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs
and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our
approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion
mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined
boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling
synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures
through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression
approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational
complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round
RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our
method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant
gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.

*Tianyi Chen,Mingcheng Zhu,Zhiyao Luo,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic benchmark comparing EHR representation methods, finding that event stream models consistently perform best and that feature selection strategies must be adapted to the clinical context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electronic Health Records enable deep learning for clinical predictions, but optimal patient data representation methods remain unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices.

Method: Systematic benchmark comparing EHR representation methods (multivariate time-series, event streams, textual event streams) across two clinical settings (MIMIC-IV for ICU tasks, EHRSHOT for longitudinal care). Evaluated various modeling families including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs, Retain, CLMBR, count-based models, and 8-20B LLMs.

Result: Event stream models consistently delivered the strongest performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in few-shot settings, while simpler count-based models can be competitive with sufficient data. Feature selection strategies must be adapted to clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU predictions, but retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks.

Conclusion: The unified and reproducible pipeline provides practical guidance for selecting EHR representations based on clinical context and data regime, with event stream models emerging as the most effective approach.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical
predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains
unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first
systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including
multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs.
This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct
clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping)
and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year
pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling
families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR
and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and
analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our
experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest
performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in
few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given
sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be
adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU
predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our
results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical
guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and
data regime.

*Le-Trung Nguyen,Enzo Tartaglione,Van-Tam Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WASI applies subspace-based training to transformers, reducing memory usage by 62x and FLOPs by 2x while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address energy consumption and data privacy concerns in AI by enabling on-device learning, overcoming the memory bottleneck of large transformer models.

Method: Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration (WASI) restricts training to a fixed subspace where essential model information resides, mitigating backpropagation memory issues.

Result: WASI reduces memory usage by up to 62x, computational cost (FLOPs) by up to 2x, achieves 1.5x faster training and inference on Raspberry Pi 5, while maintaining comparable accuracy to vanilla training.

Conclusion: Subspace-based training enables efficient on-device transformer training, making large models practical for edge devices while preserving privacy and reducing energy consumption.

Abstract: As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy
have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on
edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy.
However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle
for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact
convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to
transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information
lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration
(WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and
boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to
this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable
to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and
computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI
achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla
training.

*Benedikt Franke,Florian Heinrich,Markus Lange,Arne Raul*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes Git Re-Basin model merging and proposes a hierarchical merging scheme that outperforms standard methods, finding it induces robustness but causes larger performance drops than originally reported.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate Git Re-Basin model merging approach and improve upon the standard MergeMany algorithm by developing a more effective hierarchical merging scheme.

Method: Proposed a hierarchical model merging scheme that significantly outperforms the standard MergeMany algorithm used in Git Re-Basin.

Result: The hierarchical merging induces adversarial and perturbation robustness into merged models, with stronger effects as more models participate. However, it causes much larger performance drops than originally reported by Re-Basin authors.

Conclusion: While hierarchical Re-Basin merging enhances robustness, it comes at the cost of greater performance degradation compared to original claims, requiring careful consideration of this trade-off.

Abstract: This paper takes a closer look at Git Re-Basin, an interesting new approach
to merge trained models. We propose a hierarchical model merging scheme that
significantly outperforms the standard MergeMany algorithm. With our new
algorithm, we find that Re-Basin induces adversarial and perturbation
robustness into the merged models, with the effect becoming stronger the more
models participate in the hierarchical merging scheme. However, in our
experiments Re-Basin induces a much bigger performance drop than reported by
the original authors.

*Ling Zhan,Junjie Huang,Xiaoyao Yu,Wenyu Chen,Tao Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes GCM framework for functional brain network structure learning with global constraints, achieving significant accuracy improvements and computational efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FBN modeling relies on local pairwise interactions with limited high-order dependency capture, and existing hypergraph approaches have computational burden and heuristic limitations.

Method: GCM framework extracts high-order FBN structures under 4 global constraints (signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, data labels) for 4 modeling resolution levels (sample/subject/group/project).

Result: Achieves up to 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy and 96.3% reduction in computational time across 5 datasets and 2 task settings, outperforming 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Provides a novel perspective on FBN structure learning with interpretable results and foundation for interdisciplinary applications in cognitive neuroscience.

Abstract: Functional brain network (FBN) modeling often relies on local pairwise
interactions, whose limitation in capturing high-order dependencies is
theoretically analyzed in this paper. Meanwhile, the computational burden and
heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end
learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this,
we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and
implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN
structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint
(signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data
labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels
(sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results
demonstrate that GCM achieves up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy
and a 96.3% reduction in computational time across 5 datasets and 2 task
settings, compared to 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments validate the contributions of individual components and highlight
the interpretability of GCM. This work offers a novel perspective on FBN
structure learning and provides a foundation for interdisciplinary applications
in cognitive neuroscience. Code is publicly available on

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RepDL is an open-source library that ensures deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training/inference by addressing floating-point computation inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve non-determinism and non-reproducibility issues in deep learning caused by random number generation and floating-point computation inconsistencies.

Method: Enforces correct rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation through a deterministic library.

Result: RepDL provides bitwise-reproducible deep learning across diverse computing environments.

Conclusion: RepDL successfully addresses floating-point computation inconsistencies that remain unresolved by traditional deterministic configurations.

Abstract: Non-determinism and non-reproducibility present significant challenges in
deep learning, leading to inconsistent results across runs and platforms. These
issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point
computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic
configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To
address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures
deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference
across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct
rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation. The source code is

### [216] [On the Implicit Adversariality of Catastrophic Forgetting in Deep Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09181)
*Ze Peng,Jian Zhang,Jintao Guo,Lei Qi,Yang Gao,Yinghuan Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reveals that catastrophic forgetting in continual learning occurs because new-task training acts as an adversarial attack on old-task knowledge, with gradients aligning with sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape due to training's low-rank bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying cause of catastrophic forgetting in deep networks and explain why new-task training rapidly increases old-task loss, which has not been fully understood previously.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze how training's low-rank bias causes adversarial alignment between new-task gradients and old-task loss sharp directions. They propose backGP to address alignment caused by backward propagation, which existing gradient projection methods cannot handle.

Result: The proposed backGP method reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves accuracy by 12.7% on average compared to gradient projection methods.

Conclusion: Catastrophic forgetting is fundamentally caused by adversarial alignment between new-task gradients and old-task loss sharp directions due to training's low-rank bias, and backGP effectively addresses this issue by targeting backward propagation alignment.

Abstract: Continual learning seeks the human-like ability to accumulate new skills in
machine intelligence. Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose
underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this
paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task
training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge.
Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with
the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the
old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive
because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by
chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's
low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the
two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.
Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of
forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward
propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We
propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves
accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.

### [217] [Multimodal Prompt Optimization: Why Not Leverage Multiple Modalities for MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09201)
*Yumin Choi,Dongki Kim,Jinheon Baek,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces multimodal prompt optimization to enhance MLLMs beyond text-only approaches, proposing MPO for joint optimization of textual and non-textual prompts using alignment-preserving updates and Bayesian-based selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt optimization methods are limited to text, which restricts the full potential of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that can handle images, videos, and other modalities.

Method: Proposed Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO) - a unified framework that performs joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving updates and uses Bayesian-based selection strategy leveraging prior evaluations.

Result: MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods across diverse modalities including images, videos, and molecules, demonstrating the effectiveness of multimodal prompt optimization.

Conclusion: Multimodal prompt optimization is crucial for realizing the full potential of MLLMs, and MPO provides an effective solution that extends prompt optimization beyond text to various modalities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

*Zhenglin Wan,Jingxuan Wu,Xingrui Yu,Chubin Zhang,Mingcong Lei,Bo An,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a student-teacher framework where a simple MLP student policy explores online via RL with rewards from a teacher Flow Matching model, overcoming FM's limitations in online interaction while leveraging its distribution modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching policies have strong behavioral cloning capabilities but poor generalization in unseen scenarios due to lack of environmental interaction and exploration. Online optimization of FM policies is challenging due to gradient instability and high inference costs.

Method: Uses a student-teacher approach: a simple MLP student policy explores environment and is updated online via RL with a reward model derived from a teacher FM model. The teacher FM model provides rewards and regularizes student behavior to stabilize learning.

Result: The approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data. Avoids gradient instability of FM policies while leveraging FM's expressiveness.

Conclusion: The student-teacher framework effectively combines the expressiveness of Flow Matching with efficient online exploration, overcoming FM's limitations in online interaction while maintaining strong performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex
distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for
cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning
expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of
environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in
unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity
of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies
via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in
gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we
propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the
environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This
reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information
of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized
to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due
to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM
policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the
expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our
approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and
robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.

TL;DR: A novel method for computing prime implicant explanations in chemical reaction prediction models to improve transparency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models for chemical reaction prediction lack transparency and interpretability, making it difficult to understand their decision-making process.

Method: Introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations tailored to chemical reaction prediction and propose an algorithm for computing such explanations in small-scale tasks.

Result: Preliminary experiments show that prime implicant explanations conservatively capture ground truth explanations, containing redundant bonds and atoms but consistently capturing essential molecular attributes for reaction feasibility prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed prime implicant explanation method provides interpretable insights into reaction prediction models while maintaining essential molecular attributes for accurate prediction.

Abstract: Machine learning models that predict the feasibility of chemical reactions
have become central to automated synthesis planning. Despite their predictive
success, these models often lack transparency and interpretability. We
introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations--also known as
minimally sufficient reasons--tailored to this domain, and propose an algorithm
for computing such explanations in small-scale reaction prediction tasks.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our notion of prime implicant
explanations conservatively captures the ground truth explanations. That is,
such explanations often contain redundant bonds and atoms but consistently
capture the molecular attributes that are essential for predicting reaction
feasibility.

*Jiangwei Chen,Kieu Thao Nguyen Pham,Rachael Hwee Ling Sim,Arun Verma,Zhaoxuan Wu,Chuan-Sheng Foo,Bryan Kian Hsiang Low*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A time-aware data sharing framework that rewards early participants with higher incentives to address sequential joining in collaborative machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks assume simultaneous participation, but real-world scenarios involve parties joining at different times due to various constraints, creating unfairness for early contributors.

Method: Proposed time-aware incentives and developed methods for determining reward values that satisfy fairness and individual rationality, with model reward generation techniques.

Result: Empirical validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrated the framework's ability to properly incentivize early participation while maintaining fairness.

Conclusion: The time-aware framework successfully addresses sequential participation in collaborative data sharing by rewarding early contributors for their higher risk and role in encouraging others to join.

Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties
aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better
model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they
are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and
individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the
collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios.
Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming
legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at
different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party
who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other
wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for
sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data
sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new
methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further
illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and
empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

TL;DR: This paper examines using synthetic outliers to mitigate model drift in financial ML models for developing economies in Central Asia and the Caucasus, showing improved stability against macroeconomic shocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial ML models in developing economies like Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan are highly vulnerable to model drift due to frequent macroeconomic shocks, but drift mitigation methods for these regions remain understudied.

Method: The study investigates synthetic outliers as a drift mitigation approach and introduces a two-level evaluation framework measuring performance degradation and shock severity on macroeconomic tabular datasets.

Result: Experiments show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers generally improves model stability compared to baseline models, though optimal amounts vary by dataset and model type.

Conclusion: Synthetic outliers represent a promising approach for enhancing financial ML model stability in developing economies facing frequent macroeconomic shocks, with dataset-specific optimization required for best results.

Abstract: Machine Learning models in finance are highly susceptible to model drift,
where predictive performance declines as data distributions shift. This issue
is especially acute in developing economies such as those in Central Asia and
the Caucasus - including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan -
where frequent and unpredictable macroeconomics shocks destabilize financial
data. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine
drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We
investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to
improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness,
we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance
degradation and the severity of shocks. Our experiments on macroeconomic
tabular datasets show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers
generally improves stability compared to baseline models, though the optimal
amount varies by dataset and model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning, particularly characterizing the limits of non-interactive approaches and developing optimal interactive algorithms with improved sample complexity.

Method: For non-interactive setting: proved statistical lower bound identifying all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as fundamental complexity measure. For interactive setting: introduced framework combining reward-free RL with interactive MAIL, instantiated with MAIL-WARM algorithm.

Result: Proved BC is rate-optimal for non-interactive MAIL. MAIL-WARM improves sample complexity from O(Œµ‚Åª‚Å∏) to O(Œµ‚Åª¬≤), matching the lower bound. Numerical results show MAIL-WARM succeeds where BC fails in grid world environments.

Conclusion: The paper provides complete theoretical characterization of MAIL, establishes BC as optimal for non-interactive settings, and presents MAIL-WARM as a near-optimal interactive algorithm with significantly improved sample complexity.

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by
characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first
interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the
non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the
all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity
measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the
interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free
reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an
algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity
from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$
matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally,
we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in
environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are emerging from platforms like GitHub and social media, spanning various applications and content types. There's a need to systematically analyze these datasets and develop methods to improve prompt engineering.

Method: Compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets from various channels, selected key representative datasets for systematic analysis, and proposed a prompt optimization approach using syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures to guide LLMs in rewriting prompts toward a centroid representation.

Result: The analysis revealed commonalities and differences in prompt construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora. The proposed optimization method improved the meaningfulness of model outputs by guiding LLMs to rewrite prompts toward the identified centroid representation.

Conclusion: The work provides comprehensive prompt datasets and a novel optimization approach that leverages syntactic structures to enhance prompt effectiveness, contributing to improved LLM utilization and prompt engineering practices.

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

TL;DR: Full Gauss-Newton preconditioning achieves 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to strong baselines, with layerwise GN preconditioner nearly matching full GN performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine how much performance is lost by computationally-efficient approximations in LLM pretraining and establish a practical upper bound on iteration complexity.

Method: Applied full Gauss-Newton preconditioning to transformer models up to 150M parameters and compared with layerwise GN preconditioner that ignores cross-layer information.

Result: Full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing optimizers (SOAP, Muon), achieving 5.4x reduction in training iterations. Layerwise GN preconditioner nearly matches full GN performance.

Conclusion: GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning, layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information for most gains, and significant performance gap exists between current approximate methods and idealized layerwise oracle.

Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on
computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure.
This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is
forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a
practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton
(GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our
experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing
optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to
strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise
layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly
matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results
suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning,
implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2)
the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most
of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between
current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

TL;DR: A machine learning method that replaces algebraic loops in Modelica models with neural network surrogates trained using residual errors, achieving 60% faster simulation while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate equation-based Modelica model simulations by eliminating computationally expensive algebraic loops through neural network surrogates.

Method: Uses feedforward neural networks trained with residual (error) of algebraic loops directly in loss function, eliminating need for supervised datasets and resolving ambiguous solution issues.

Result: Applied to IEEE 14-Bus system, achieved 60% reduction in simulation time compared to conventional methods while maintaining same accuracy through error control.

Conclusion: Residual-informed machine learning approach successfully replaces algebraic loops with neural network surrogates, significantly speeding up simulations without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents a residual-informed machine learning approach for
replacing algebraic loops in equation-based Modelica models with neural network
surrogates. A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error)
of the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a
supervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous
solutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather
than averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus
system, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to
conventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through
error control mechanisms.

*Rahel Rickenbach,Jelena Trisovic,Alexandre Didier,Jerome Sieber,Melanie N. Zeilinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper uses dynamical systems framework to analyze softmax, norm, and linear attention mechanisms by examining their eigenvalue spectra, revealing how eigenvalues influence memory and long-range dependency modeling in sequence models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand fundamental differences in information processing between softmax attention and linear alternatives like state space models (SSMs), and to address the quadratic complexity limitation of softmax attention.

Method: Leverage dynamical systems framework to represent attention mechanisms as dynamical systems, conduct extensive empirical analysis of eigenvalue spectra across diverse sequence models and benchmarks, and investigate how architectural modifications impact both eigenvalues and performance.

Result: Eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency modeling, with spectral signatures aligning with task requirements. Architectural modifications in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance.

Conclusion: Eigenvalue analysis serves as a principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and improving sequence model capabilities, strengthening its position as an analytical tool for model design and optimization.

Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence
models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear
alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives
improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing
remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed
dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as
dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing
their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential
aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical
analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that
eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency
modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements.
Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications
in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This
correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a
principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the
capabilities of sequence models.

*Jerome Sieber,Antonio Orvieto,Melanie N. Zeilinger,Carmen Amo Alonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework that analyzes deep sequence models by casting their output operations as linear combinations from autonomous linear dynamical systems, revealing common mathematical themes across Transformers, SSMs, and RNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare and understand diverse sequence model architectures by developing a unified mathematical framework that captures their common output computation patterns.

Method: Develops a framework that treats linear combination coefficients as outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by impulse inputs, connecting Transformers, SSMs, RNNs, and linear attention models.

Result: The framework reveals common mathematical structures across architectures, explains empirical successes of recent designs, and identifies design principles linking architectural choices to model properties.

Conclusion: Provides systematic principles for designing new sequence models by connecting insights from literature, explaining tradeoffs between expressivity and efficiency, and establishing stability conditions for training.

Abstract: Deep sequence models, ranging from Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs)
to more recent approaches such as gated linear RNNs, fundamentally compute
outputs as linear combinations of past value vectors. To draw insights and
systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that
makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination
coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by
impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from
approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a
common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures
softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new
model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design
principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby
identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation,
geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for
numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several
insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains
empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for
systematically designing new sequence model architectures.

*Tuan Nguyen,Long Tran-Thanh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A black-box framework for LLM safety alignment that uses game theory to balance safety and helpfulness without requiring model retraining or internal access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment methods are costly, inflexible, and require model internals, making them impractical for third-party stakeholders without model access.

Method: Formulates safety-helpfulness trade-off as a two-player zero-sum game, using linear programming at inference time to compute equilibrium strategies between LLM agents.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of black-box safety alignment that maintains optimal balance between safety and helpfulness.

Conclusion: Provides scalable and accessible safety enforcement for stakeholders, especially smaller organizations and resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is
a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily
operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning
from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring
retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward
inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume
access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third
party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we
propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does
not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof
of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but
uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate
this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures
the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize
this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to
compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for
stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in
resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM
ecosystems.

### [230] [Bandits with Single-Peaked Preferences and Limited Resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09425)
*Gur Keinan,Rotem Torkan,Omer Ben-Porat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online stochastic matching with budget constraints where users have single-peaked preferences over arms. Efficient algorithms developed with regret bounds of OÃÉ(UKT^{2/3}) for unknown structure and OÃÉ(U‚àö(TK)) for known structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online matching with budget constraints is NP-hard without structural assumptions, making online learning computationally infeasible. Single-peaked preferences provide a tractable structure from social choice theory.

Method: 1) For unknown structure: PQ tree-based order approximation method to learn single-peaked preferences. 2) For known structure: UCB-like algorithm leveraging the known preference structure. Both methods build on an efficient offline budgeted matching algorithm.

Result: Achieved regret bounds of OÃÉ(UKT^{2/3}) when learning the single-peaked structure, and OÃÉ(U‚àö(TK)) when the structure is known, both being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: Single-peaked preferences enable efficient online learning for budgeted matching problems, overcoming computational barriers through structured preference assumptions.

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm
sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative
reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural
assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning
computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on
\emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social
choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common
order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted
matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a
regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based
order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop
an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(U\sqrt{TK})$.

*Till Aczel,Lucas Theis,Wattenhofer Roger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BBQ is a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model that improves human evaluation of generative models by modeling rater quality, providing faster convergence and more robust rankings compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard metrics for evaluating generative models often fail to reflect human preferences, and human evaluations are costly and noisy due to participant variability in expertise and attention.

Method: BBQ uses a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that explicitly models rater quality, downweighting unreliable participants, and employs an Expectation-Maximization algorithm with guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence.

Result: Empirical results show BBQ achieves faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust, interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with noisy or crowdsourced raters.

Conclusion: The BBQ framework enables more reliable and cost-effective human evaluation of generative models by addressing rater variability and providing convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

*Vu Duc Anh Nguyen,Ziyue Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes XGeoAI, a novel framework for live, explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting using a two-stage autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model trained on Dutch railway data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Railway network efficiency is undermined by cascading train delays, and existing approaches lack frameworks for multi-step autoregressive forecasting with live interpretable explanations needed for decision support.

Method: A two-stage autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model that represents the railway system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events, enriched with granular features like platform and station congestion. Evaluated using sequential k-step-ahead forecasting protocol.

Result: While the GATv2 model is challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events - crucial for reliable decision support.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides viable live deployment for train delay forecasting with better delay classification precision, making it suitable as a decision support tool despite some error metric limitations.

Abstract: The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern
economies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays.
Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for
real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap
remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive
forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,
interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses
this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,
explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a
two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a
real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model
represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events
(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including
platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the
model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting
protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can
compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is
challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it
achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial
advantage for a reliable decision support tool.

*Mikhail Terekhov,Alexander Panfilov,Daniil Dzenhaliou,Caglar Gulcehre,Maksym Andriushchenko,Ameya Prabhu,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive attacks can bypass AI control protocols that rely on LLM monitors, making current security measures ineffective against informed attackers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI control protocols depend on LLM monitors as a central defense, but these can be exploited by attackers who know the protocol and monitor details.

Method: Researchers instantiated adaptive attacks where attackers embed publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in model outputs to evade monitors.

Result: Frontier models consistently evaded diverse monitors and completed malicious tasks on AI control benchmarks, with the Defer-to-Resample protocol actually amplifying attacks.

Conclusion: Adaptive attacks on monitor models represent a major blind spot in current control protocols and should be included in future AI control evaluations.

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM
agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a
security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context
to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,
most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can
become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted
model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the
untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for
this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector
by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in
the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade
diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control
benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on
a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,
as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as
a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent
a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard
component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes machine learning models for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) diagnosis, achieving up to 99% accuracy with Random Forest and Logistic Regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: About 10% of global population suffers from CKD, requiring effective risk evaluation and monitoring. Machine learning can provide quick and precise detection capabilities to help practitioners.

Method: Used UCL machine learning repository CKD dataset with missing values filled using 'mean-mode' and 'Random sampling method'. Applied 8 ML techniques: Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost.

Result: Random Forest and Logistic Regression achieved 99% accuracy, followed by AdaBoost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and SVM. KNN performed worst with 73% accuracy.

Conclusion: Machine learning models, particularly Random Forest and Logistic Regression, can effectively predict CKD with high accuracy, supporting healthcare diagnosis systems.

Abstract: Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population
is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney
function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney
damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are
crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning
models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an
enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector
nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction
capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive
computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is
attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing
values; those are filled in using "mean-mode" and "Random sampling method"
strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques
(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision
Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance
evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the
techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among
them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%
accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and
SVM, whereas the KNN classifier model stands last with an accuracy of 73%.

*Ankush Pratap Singh,Houwei Cao,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CHUCKLE is a perception-driven curriculum learning framework for emotion recognition that uses human annotator agreement to define sample difficulty, improving model accuracy and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing curriculum learning approaches for emotion recognition neglect human perception difficulty, which is crucial for subjective tasks like emotion recognition.

Method: Leverages annotator agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty, assuming clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for ML models.

Result: Increases relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over non-curriculum baselines, while reducing gradient updates.

Conclusion: CHUCKLE enhances both training efficiency and model robustness by incorporating human perception difficulty into curriculum learning.

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) structures training from simple to complex samples,
facilitating progressive learning. However, existing CL approaches for emotion
recognition often rely on heuristic, data-driven, or model-based definitions of
sample difficulty, neglecting the difficulty for human perception, a critical
factor in subjective tasks like emotion recognition. We propose CHUCKLE
(Crowdsourced Human Understanding Curriculum for Knowledge Led Emotion
Recognition), a perception-driven CL framework that leverages annotator
agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty,
under the assumption that clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for
machine learning models. Empirical results suggest that CHUCKLE increases the
relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over
non-curriculum baselines, while reducing the number of gradient updates,
thereby enhancing both training efficiency and model robustness.

TL;DR: HINT is an adaptive hinting framework that improves RL training for LLMs by providing heuristic hints instead of direct answers, addressing reward sparsity and training instability issues in complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for LLMs fail when task difficulty exceeds model capacity, causing reward sparsity and inefficient training. Prior approaches using off-policy data often misguide policy updates due to low training affinity.

Method: Proposed HINT framework that supplies heuristic hints to guide models toward discovering solutions autonomously, preserving reasoning capabilities while improving exploration efficiency.

Result: HINT consistently outperforms existing methods on mathematical reasoning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results across various model scales with more stable learning and greater data efficiency.

Conclusion: The HINT framework effectively addresses training affinity issues in RL for LLMs, demonstrating superior performance and stability compared to existing approaches while maintaining model autonomy.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

*Sangyun Lee,Brandon Amos,Giulia Fanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaNEL is a Bayesian algorithm that post-trains generative models using only failed attempts, minimizing expensive reward evaluations while improving performance in sparse-reward scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models struggle when reward signals are near-zero and reward evaluations are expensive, creating a different learning challenge than standard reward-based post-training.

Method: BaNEL casts learning from failures as an in-loop generative modeling problem, using this model to identify and avoid previously seen failure patterns while minimizing reward evaluations.

Result: BaNEL improves model performance without observing successful samples, outperforming novelty-bonus approaches by several orders of magnitude in success rate while using fewer reward evaluations.

Conclusion: Learning from failures through Bayesian modeling enables effective post-training in sparse-reward environments where traditional methods fail.

Abstract: Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and
informative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation. They
work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to
pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about
how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the
hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base
generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward
oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning
challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose
BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the
model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward
evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of
learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop
generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new
data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from
them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a
single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing
novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,
while using fewer reward evaluations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an RFFI framework using adversarial training and style transfer to address cross-receiver variability, achieving up to 10% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployment of RF fingerprint identification is hindered by receiver-induced variability, causing models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns and degrade performance when receivers change.

Method: Integrates adversarial training and style transfer to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features, enforcing domain-invariant representation learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets show the approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with up to 10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully isolates genuine hardware signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver changes in RF fingerprint identification systems.

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for
wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections
introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter
identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in
extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by
receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise
transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and
receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel
noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the
RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is
particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,
as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance
degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to
cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer
to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing
domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware
signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver
changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a
10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates temporal graph learning models' ability to capture fundamental graph attributes, revealing that while models perform well on benchmarks, they have important limitations in capturing key structural and temporal properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent concerns about the reliability of temporal graph learning benchmarks and the surprising competitiveness of simple heuristics raise questions about what properties models actually use for predictions.

Method: Systematically evaluated seven temporal graph learning models on their ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to link structure, including structural characteristics (density), temporal patterns (recency), and edge formation mechanisms (homophily), using both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: Mixed performance - models capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others, exposing important limitations in current temporal graph learning approaches.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical insights for applying temporal graph learning models and motivate more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph
representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong
performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised
concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with
commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple
heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the
underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their
predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their
ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure
of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density,
temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as
homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well
models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models
capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose
important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical
insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate
more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes weight initialization effects across ReLU MLPs and GPT-2 transformers, identifying optimal initialization ranges and demonstrating Kaiming initialization's superiority over Xavier for ReLU networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how weight initialization governs signal propagation and gradient flow at training start, and to connect classic initialization principles with modern transformer behavior.

Method: Conducted logarithmic sweep of initial standard deviations, compared Kaiming vs Xavier initialization for ReLU networks, and tracked layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining in a 12-layer GPT-2-style model.

Result: Found stability band with standard deviations 1e-2 to 1e-1, Kaiming initialization converges faster and more stably than Xavier for ReLU, and observed depth-dependent equilibration where shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper layers change gradually.

Conclusion: The results provide simple, practical recipes for robust training and connect classic initialization principles with modern transformer behavior.

Abstract: Weight initialization governs signal propagation and gradient flow at the
start of training. This paper offers a theory-grounded and empirically
validated study across two regimes: compact ReLU multilayer perceptrons and
GPT-2-style transformers. First, a logarithmic sweep of the initial standard
deviation maps vanishing and exploding regimes and identifies a broad stability
band with standard deviations between 1e-2 and 1e-1. Second, a controlled
comparison shows that Kaiming (fan-in) initialization converges faster and more
stably than Xavier under ReLU, consistent with variance-preserving theory.
Third, in a from-scratch 12-layer GPT-2-style model, this paper tracks
layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining and observe depth-dependent
equilibration into narrow bands: shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper
layers change more gradually. Together, these results connect classic
initialization principles with modern transformer behavior and yield simple,
practical recipes for robust training.

*Disharee Bhowmick,Ranjith Ramanathan,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaTS is an unsupervised framework that compresses time series into compact token sequences by detecting change points and summarizing segments, achieving up to 30x compression while preserving temporal structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard time series models treat all time steps equally, leading to inefficiencies and poor robustness in long or noisy sequences. Existing approaches don't leverage latent temporal structure like regime transitions and repeated motifs.

Method: Detects change points across multiple temporal resolutions using BIC-based statistical divergence criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions (mean) or generative models (GMMs). Operates as model-agnostic preprocessor.

Result: Achieves 85-90% of full-model performance with dramatic computational cost reductions. Enables up to 30x sequence compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. Improves robustness under noise and outperforms uniform/clustering-based compression baselines.

Conclusion: STaTS provides a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware time series modeling that can be integrated with existing unsupervised encoders without retraining.

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

### [242] [Cross-attention Secretly Performs Orthogonal Alignment in Recommendation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09435)
*Hyunin Lee,Yong Zhang,Hoang Vu Nguyen,Xiaoyi Liu,Namyong Park,Christopher Jung,Rong Jin,Yang Wang,Zhigang Wang,Somayeh Sojoudi,Xue Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cross-attention in CDSR can function as Orthogonal Alignment, discovering novel information not present in query inputs, which naturally emerges and improves model performance and scaling efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the underlying mechanisms of cross-attention in cross-domain sequential recommendation, moving beyond the conventional residual alignment interpretation.

Method: Analysis of cross-attention mechanisms through over 300 experiments, examining when query inputs and cross-attention outputs become orthogonal, without explicit orthogonality constraints.

Result: Orthogonal Alignment naturally emerges and improves model performance, with cross-attention modules outperforming parameter-matched baselines and achieving superior accuracy-per-model parameter.

Conclusion: Orthogonal Alignment and residual alignment can co-exist in recommendation models, offering new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in multi-modal research.

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to align heterogeneous
user behavior sequences collected from different domains. While cross-attention
is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret
cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by
removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query
input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond
the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which
cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query
input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can
co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output
of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300
experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any
explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal
Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that
baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform
parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter.
We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in
multi-modal research.

### [243] [On Uniformly Scaling Flows: A Density-Aligned Approach to Deep One-Class Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09452)
*Faried Abu Zaid,Tim Katzke,Emmanuel M√ºller,Daniel Neider*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Uniformly scaling flows (USFs) connect deep one-class classification and density estimation approaches in anomaly detection, showing that USF training reduces to a Deep SVDD objective with inherent regularization against collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between two major anomaly detection paradigms: deep one-class classification (like Deep SVDD) and density estimation (like normalizing flows), showing their theoretical connection through USFs.

Method: Prove that training uniformly scaling flows (USFs) via maximum-likelihood is equivalent to Deep SVDD objective with unique regularization, and demonstrate USFs as drop-in replacements for non-USFs in anomaly detection architectures.

Result: USFs achieve tighter alignment between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than Deep SVDD or non-USFs, yield consistent performance gains, and substantially improve training stability across multiple benchmarks for both image-level and pixel-level detection.

Conclusion: USFs unify two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical performance, and should be used as drop-in replacements for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied
paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns
compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized
by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this
work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a
constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.
Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a
Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents
representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit
both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of
one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment
between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or
non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with
VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as
a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.
Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and
substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model
backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify
two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding
and practical performance.

*Saeid Mashhadi,Amirhossein Saghezchi,Vesal Ghassemzadeh Kashani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An interpretable ML framework predicts startup outcomes (funding, patenting, exit) using firm-quarter data from 2010-2023, achieving high AUROC scores of 0.921, 0.817, and 0.872 respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a transparent and reproducible machine learning approach for forecasting startup success metrics including funding acquisition, patent growth, and exit events (IPO/acquisition).

Method: Constructed firm-quarter panel from Crunchbase and USPTO data, evaluated three prediction horizons (12, 24, 36 months), used development window (2010-2019) for preprocessing to avoid data leakage, addressed class imbalance with inverse-prevalence weights and SMOTE-NC, compared logistic regression with tree ensembles (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost).

Result: Achieved high predictive performance with AUROC values: 0.921 for patent predictions, 0.817 for funding predictions, and 0.872 for exit predictions, demonstrating strong forecasting capability across different startup outcomes.

Conclusion: The interpretable ML framework provides transparent and reproducible rankings for innovation finance, successfully predicting key startup outcomes with high accuracy across multiple time horizons.

Abstract: This study develops an interpretable machine learning framework to forecast
startup outcomes, including funding, patenting, and exit. A firm-quarter panel
for 2010-2023 is constructed from Crunchbase and matched to U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) data. Three horizons are evaluated: next funding
within 12 months, patent-stock growth within 24 months, and exit through an
initial public offering (IPO) or acquisition within 36 months. Preprocessing is
fit on a development window (2010-2019) and applied without change to later
cohorts to avoid leakage. Class imbalance is addressed using inverse-prevalence
weights and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for Nominal and
Continuous features (SMOTE-NC). Logistic regression and tree ensembles,
including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are compared using
the area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) and the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Patent, funding, and exit
predictions achieve AUROC values of 0.921, 0.817, and 0.872, providing
transparent and reproducible rankings for innovation finance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for analyzing latent manifolds of autoencoders as implicit submanifolds, developing robust discrete Riemannian calculus tools for geometric computations including geodesic paths and exponential maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study latent manifolds of autoencoders from a geometric perspective and enable robust computation of geometric operators despite inaccuracies in implicit representations that often occur in practice.

Method: Learn an approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising objective, then develop discrete Riemannian calculus tools for approximating classical geometric operators on these implicit submanifolds.

Result: The approach successfully computes geodesic paths connecting given end points and enables shooting geodesics via Riemannian exponential maps on latent manifolds across various autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust geometric analysis tool for latent manifolds that is independent of the underlying autoencoder and supports different Riemannian geometries, enabling practical computation of fundamental geometric operations.

Abstract: Latent manifolds of autoencoders provide low-dimensional representations of
data, which can be studied from a geometric perspective. We propose to describe
these latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds of some ambient latent space.
Based on this, we develop tools for a discrete Riemannian calculus
approximating classical geometric operators. These tools are robust against
inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical
examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an
approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising
objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and
supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds.
The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths
connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian
exponential maps on latent manifolds. We evaluate our approach on various
autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: CRPS-LAM is an effective approach for probabilistic regional weather forecasting that combines computational efficiency with maintained forecast quality.

Abstract: Machine learning for weather prediction increasingly relies on ensemble
methods to provide probabilistic forecasts. Diffusion-based models have shown
strong performance in Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) but remain computationally
expensive at sampling time. Building on the success of global weather
forecasting models trained based on Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS),
we introduce CRPS-LAM, a probabilistic LAM forecasting model trained with a

into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass,
achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model.
We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the
low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details,
the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional
weather forecasting

TL;DR: The paper introduces MB-AIL, a model-based adversarial imitation learning algorithm that achieves horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees for online interaction with limited expert demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the poorly understood benefits of online interaction and impact of stochasticity in adversarial imitation learning, where agents learn from offline expert demonstrations without reward access.

Method: Proposed MB-AIL (model-based adversarial imitation learning) algorithm with general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free interactions.

Result: Achieved horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees that scale with variance of returns, tighten in deterministic systems, and match minimax-optimal sample complexity for online interaction.

Conclusion: MB-AIL attains optimal sample complexity with limited expert data and matches lower bounds, with experiments showing practical implementation outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns
from offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online
without access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of
online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We
address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and
establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under
general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free
interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result
that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and
therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with
second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed
hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample
complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited
expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in
terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy
variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the
sample efficiency of existing methods.

TL;DR: Geo-STARS is a geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework that uses geographic embeddings to improve generalization of stream water temperature prediction across different watersheds and spatial scales, addressing data heterogeneity and limited observation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing physics-based and data-driven models fail to generalize across varying spatial regions and scales due to data heterogeneity in environmental ecosystems, and this is worsened by limited observation samples for training.

Method: Introduces geo-aware embedding that leverages geographic information to capture shared patterns across regions and scales, integrated into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network to learn complex spatial-temporal patterns guided by geographic and hydrological context.

Result: Geo-STARS demonstrates superior generalization performance across regions and scales in predicting stream water temperature, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on real-world datasets spanning 37 years across multiple watersheds along the eastern US coast.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for scalable, data-efficient environmental monitoring and decision-making by effectively addressing generalization challenges in environmental ecosystem modeling.

Abstract: Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable
management of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models
often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the
inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This
generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples
available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a
geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water
temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major
innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which
leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and
patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware
embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design
enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by
geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.
We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which
is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37
years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States,
Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both
regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental
monitoring and decision-making.

increase in throughput (by 13%) without noticeable degradation in the target
metric.

*Nathan Quiblier,Roy Friedman,Matthew Ricci*

TL;DR: MODE is a graphical modeling framework that uses neural gating to decompose complex biological dynamics into sparse, interpretable components, enabling unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and accurate forecasting across noisy transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional flow-based modeling techniques struggle with complex, overlapping behavioral regimes in life sciences where transitions between regimes appear noisy and irregular, requiring a method that can handle discontinuous dynamics.

Method: Proposed MODE (Mixture Of Dynamical Experts) framework with neural gating mechanism that allows agents to jump between different governing laws, decomposing complex dynamics into sparse components for regime discovery and forecasting.

Result: Successfully benchmarked on synthetic data for unsupervised classification, demonstrated accurate forecasting on cell biology processes, and deployed on human single-cell RNA sequencing data to distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics and predict cell fate commitment.

Conclusion: MODE effectively addresses the challenge of modeling complex, overlapping behavioral regimes with noisy transitions in biological systems, providing both interpretable regime discovery and accurate long-term forecasting capabilities.

Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures
of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from
cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental
fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,
posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which
assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE
(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural
gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable
components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and
accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because
agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is
especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our
method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.
First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task
using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample
settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks
which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we
deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it
can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also
predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding
challenge in computational biology.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the fundamental sensing limit of pinching-antenna systems using Bayesian Cram√©r-Rao bound, revealing performance advantages over conventional arrays and proposing two scheduling protocols with different complexity-performance tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a practical and comprehensive lower bound for evaluating sensing performance in pinching-antenna systems, overcoming limitations of conventional CRB which depends on exact parameter values and requires unbiased estimators.

Method: Used Bayesian Cram√©r-Rao bound analysis for single and multi-target scenarios in TDMA systems, proposed pinch switching and pinch multiplexing protocols, formulated optimization problems for power minimization and min-max BCRB, and solved using KKT conditions with element-wise algorithms.

Result: PASS with large-scale reconfigurability significantly outperforms conventional fixed-position arrays; pinch switching provides more robust performance than pinch multiplexing but with higher computational complexity; discovered mismatch between sensing centroid and distribution centroid requiring dynamic PA repositioning.

Conclusion: Pinching-antenna systems offer substantial sensing performance improvements over conventional arrays, with dynamic antenna repositioning being essential and pinch switching providing the best robustness-complexity tradeoff for practical implementations.

Abstract: The fundamental sensing limit of pinching-antenna systems (PASS) is studied
from a Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB) perspective. Compared to conventional
CRB, BCRB is independent of the exact values of sensing parameters and is not
restricted by the unbiasedness of the estimator, thus offering a practical and
comprehensive lower bound for evaluating sensing performance. A system where
multiple targets transmit uplink pilots to a single-waveguide PASS under a
time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme is analyzed. For the single-target
scenario, our analysis reveals a unique mismatch between the sensing centroid
(i.e., the optimal PA position) and the distribution centroid (i.e., the center
of the target's prior distribution), underscoring the necessity of dynamic PA
repositioning. For the multi-target scenario, two target scheduling protocols
are proposed: 1) pinch switching (PS), which performs separate pinching
beamforming for each time slot, and 2) pinch multiplexing (PM), which applies a
single beamforming configuration across all slots. Based on these protocols,
both the total power minimization problem under a BCRB threshold and the
min-max BCRB problem under a total power constraint are formulated. By
leveraging Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, these problems are equivalently
converted into a search over PA positions and solved using an element-wise
algorithm. Numerical results show that i)~PASS, endowed with large-scale
reconfigurability, can significantly enhance the sensing performance compared
with conventional fixed-position arrays, and ii)~PS provides more robust
performances than PM at the cost of higher computational complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to capture intra- and cross-layer interactions in complex multi-layer networks requires topological algebraic descriptors that can localize homologies at different scales for learning tasks.

Method: Introduces Cell MultiComplexes (CMCs) as novel topological spaces, develops cross-Laplacian operators as algebraic descriptors, uses eigenvectors for signal representation, and creates topological signal processing tools including filtering and topology learning strategies.

Result: Cross-Laplacian based signal representation achieves better sparsity/accuracy trade-off compared to monocomplex representations, and the method successfully infers second-order cross-cells between layers in brain networks to encode inter-module connectivity patterns.

Conclusion: CMC spaces and cross-Laplacian operators provide effective tools for analyzing multi-layer networks, enabling better signal representation and topology learning for complex interconnected systems like brain networks.

Abstract: One of the key challenges in many research fields is uncovering how different
interconnected systems interact within complex networks, typically represented
as multi-layer networks. Capturing the intra- and cross-layer interactions
among different domains for analysis and processing calls for topological
algebraic descriptors capable of localizing the homologies of different
domains, at different scales, according to the learning task. Our first
contribution in this paper is to introduce the Cell MultiComplexes (CMCs),
which are novel topological spaces that enable the representation of
higher-order interactions among interconnected cell complexes. We introduce
cross-Laplacian operators as powerful algebraic descriptors of CMC spaces able
to capture different topological invariants, whether global or local, at
different resolutions. Using the eigenvectors of these operators as bases for
the signal representation, we develop topological signal processing tools for
signals defined over CMCs. Then, we focus on the signal spectral representation
and on the filtering of noisy flows observed over the cross-edges between
different layers of CMCs. We show that a local signal representation based on
cross-Laplacians yields a better sparsity/accuracy trade-off compared to
monocomplex representations, which provide overcomplete representation of local
signals. Finally, we illustrate a topology learning strategy designed to infer
second-order cross-cells between layers, with applications to brain networks
for encoding inter-module connectivity patterns.

Conclusion: The framework effectively learns underlying product graphs from 2D signals with improved performance over traditional approaches.

Abstract: Graph learning aims to infer a network structure directly from observed data,
enabling the analysis of complex dependencies in irregular domains. Traditional
methods focus on scalar signals at each node, ignoring dependencies along
additional dimensions such as time, configurations of the observation device,
or populations. In this work, we propose a graph signal processing framework
for learning graphs from two-dimensional signals, modeled as matrix graph
signals generated by joint filtering along both dimensions. This formulation
leverages the concept of graph stationarity across the two dimensions and
leverages product graph representations to capture structured dependencies.
Based on this model, we design an optimization problem that can be solved
efficiently and provably recovers the optimal underlying
Kronecker/Cartesian/strong product graphs. Experiments on synthetic data
demonstrate that our approach achieves higher estimation accuracy and reduced
computational cost compared to existing methods.

*Siddarth Marwaha,Pawel Kryszkiewicz,Eduard A. Jorswieck*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper proposes an energy-efficient power allocation scheme for M-MIMO OFDM systems with nonlinear power amplifiers, deriving closed-form SNDR expressions and developing a low-complexity algorithm that achieves over 100% EE improvement compared to fixed back-off baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing M-MIMO resource allocation schemes overlook PA transmission power optimization and nonlinear distortion effects, particularly neglecting subcarrier intermodulations in OFDM systems with wide-band transmission.

Method: Modeled wide-band transmission using soft-limiter PA model, derived closed-form SNDR expression under Rayleigh fading and MRT precoding, defined EE function considering two PA architectures, and proposed low-complexity root-finding algorithm for transmit power optimization.

Result: Simulation results show significant EE gains with over 100% improvement over fixed PA back-off baseline under both low and high path loss conditions.

Conclusion: The optimal operating point depends on antenna count, PA model, and propagation conditions, demonstrating the importance of accounting for nonlinear PA effects in M-MIMO OFDM system design.

Abstract: Although multiple works have proposed energy-efficient resource allocation
schemes for Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (M-MIMO) system, most
approaches overlook the potential of optimizing Power Amplifier (PA)
transmission power while accounting for non-linear distortion effects.
Furthermore, most M-MIMO studies assume narrow-band transmission, neglecting
subcarrier intermodulations at the non-linear PA for an Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system. Therefore, this work investigates the
energy-efficient power allocation for a single-user equipment (UE) M-MIMO
downlink (DL) system employing OFDM with nonlinear PAs. Unlike prior works, we
model wide-band transmission using a soft-limiter PA model and derive a
closed-form expression for the signal-to-distortion-and-noise ratio (SNDR)
under Rayleigh fading and Maximal Ratio Transmission (MRT) precoding. Next, the
Energy Efficiency (EE) function is defined considering two PA architectures and
a distorted OFDM signal. We then propose a low complexity root-finding
algorithm to maximize EE by transmit power adjustment. Simulation results
demonstrate significant EE gains over a fixed PA back-off baseline, with over
$100\%$ improvement under both low and high path loss. Our findings reveal how
the optimal operating point depends on the antenna count, the PA model, and the
propagation conditions.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A resource allocation framework for massive MIMO networks that jointly optimizes transmit power and active antennas while accounting for nonlinear power amplifier effects, achieving significant energy efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining high energy efficiency in wireless networks is crucial, especially with massive MIMO technology adoption, and existing approaches often neglect nonlinear power amplifier effects which limit performance.

Method: Uses an alternating optimization approach for joint power and antenna allocation in downlink MU-MIMO-OFDM with ZF precoding, explicitly modeling nonlinear power amplifiers and avoiding explicit transmit power constraints.

Result: Achieves median EE gains of 40% for ideal PAs and 20% for Class B PAs over distortion-neglecting baselines in a 5km cell serving 60 users scenario.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates significant energy efficiency improvements by properly accounting for nonlinear power amplifier effects, confirming their high impact on wireless network performance.

Abstract: Maintaining high energy efficiency (EE) in wireless networks is crucial,
particularly with the adoption of massive MIMO technology. This work introduces
a resource allocation framework that jointly optimizes transmit power assigned
to each user and the number of active antennas, while explicitly accounting for
a nonlinear Power Amplifier (PA). We consider a downlink MU-MIMO-OFDM
transmission with zero forcing (ZF) precoding, Rayleigh fading channels, and
soft-limiter PAs, with both ideal and realistic PA architectures. In contrast
to existing formulations, our optimization framework avoids imposing an
explicit transmit power constraint, since the nonlinear distortion inherently
limits the feasible operating region. To solve the resulting non-convex
problem, an alternating optimization approach is adopted that, by exploiting
properties of the EE function, guarantees convergence to a stationary point.
Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent performance gains over
distortion-neglecting and power-only optimized baselines. In a scenario of a 5
km radius cell serving 60 randomly distributed users, the median EE gains over
the distortion-neglecting allocation reach 40% for ideal PAs and 20% for Class
B PAs, confirming high impact of the proposed solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the practical feasibility of OLT in real-world field deployments and extend its capability beyond basic power monitoring to comprehensive 4D analysis for identifying various quality of transmission degradation sources.

Method: Used commercial transponder under standard DWDM transmission, implemented 4D visualization across distance, time, frequency, and polarization dimensions, and improved power efficiency through signal averaging across all available dimensions.

Result: Successfully observed multiple loss anomalies in field-deployed links even at launch power lower than system-optimal level, demonstrating practical viability of OLT in real network scenarios.

Conclusion: OLT is a viable technology for comprehensive network monitoring from commissioning to operation, capable of identifying multiple degradation causes through 4D visualization while operating efficiently at practical power levels.

Abstract: Optical link tomography (OLT) is a rapidly evolving field that allows the
multi-span, end-to-end visualization of optical power along fiber links in
multiple dimensions from network endpoints, solely by processing signals
received at coherent receivers. This paper has two objectives: (1) to report
the first field trial of OLT, using a commercial transponder under standard
DWDM transmission, and (2) to extend its capability to visualize across 4D
(distance, time, frequency, and polarization), allowing for locating and
measuring multiple QoT degradation causes, including time-varying power
anomalies, spectral anomalies, and excessive polarization dependent loss. We
also address a critical aspect of OLT, i.e., its need for high fiber launch
power, by improving power profile signal-to-noise ratio through averaging
across all available dimensions. Consequently, multiple loss anomalies in a
field-deployed link are observed even at launch power lower than the
system-optimal level. The applications and use cases of OLT from network
commissioning to provisioning and operation for current and near-term network
scenarios are also discussed.

*Ataher Sams,Simone Di Bari,Besma Smida,Natasha Devroye,Daniela Tuninetti,Giorgio Taricco*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper analyzes ISAC fundamental limits when BS has statistical CSI instead of full CSI, using Bayesian Cram√©r-Rao Bound framework to derive BCRB-rate trade-offs for multi-target AoA estimation while communicating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous ISAC literature assumed full CSI at BS, but realistic scenarios involve only statistical CSI. The paper addresses this gap by studying ISAC performance under statistical channel knowledge.

Method: Uses Bayesian Cram√©r-Rao Bound framework for sensing limits under MMSE criteria. Introduces transmission strategies sharing power across sensing and communication beams over coherence time, with beam allocation based on principal eigenvectors of target-specific sensing matrices.

Result: Beam allocation using principal eigenvectors minimizes individual AoA errors, while balanced strategies optimize joint estimation at cost of individual accuracy. Leveraging updated BCRB-based sensing for communication receiver (with lower uncertainty) significantly improves communication rates.

Conclusion: The study provides fundamental limits and practical strategies for ISAC under statistical CSI, demonstrating that proper beam allocation and leveraging channel uncertainty differences can optimize both sensing and communication performance.

Abstract: This paper explores the fundamental limits of Integrated Sensing and
Communication (ISAC) in a more realistic setting compared to previous
literature when the Base Staion (BS) has only statistical CSI of the
communication user rather than full CSI. We analyze a monostatic setting where
the BS performs multi-target Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation while
simultaneously communicating with one of the targets. We assume that the BS has
statistical CSI about all AoAs, with less uncertainty in the AoA of the
communication receiver. The communication receiver is assumed to have perfect
CSI. Utilizing a Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound (BCRB) framework to characterize
the fundamental limits of sensing under minimum mean square error (MMSE)
criteria, we derive achievable BCRB-rate trade-off regions. Our approach
introduces a number of transmission strategies that share power across sensing
and communication beams over a coherence time. Our analysis reveals that beam
allocation strategies leveraging the principal eigenvectors of the
target-specific sensing matrices minimize individual AoA estimation errors,
while strategies balancing sensing and communication directions optimize joint
estimation performance at the cost of individual accuracy. We demonstrate that
leveraging updated BCRB-based sensing information for the communication
receiver, due to its lower channel uncertainty, enables significantly improved
communication rates.

TL;DR: Proposes a two-dimensional ice-filling algorithm for joint design of precoders and combiners in densifying MIMO systems to maximize mutual information for improved channel estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strong correlations among densifying antennas provide CSI prior knowledge that can be exploited to boost channel estimation performance through careful design of observation matrices.

Method: Jointly designs combiners and precoders by maximizing mutual information between received pilots and channels using a 2DIF algorithm that decouples channel covariance eigenspace into transmitter and receiver sub-eigenspaces.

Result: Simulation results show superior channel estimation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art schemes, with extension to hybrid combining systems via TS-2DIF algorithm.

Conclusion: The proposed 2DIF and TS-2DIF methods effectively exploit channel correlations to generate near-optimal observation matrices for improved densifying MIMO channel estimation.

Abstract: In recent years, densifying multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has
attracted much attention from the communication community. Thanks to the
subwavelength antenna spacing, the strong correlations among densifying
antennas provide sufficient prior knowledge about channel state information
(CSI). This inspires the careful design of observation matrices (e.g., transmit
precoders and receive combiners), that exploits the CSI prior knowledge, to
boost channel estimation performance. Aligned with this vision, this work
proposes to jointly design the combiners and precoders by maximizing the mutual
information between the received pilots and densifying MIMO channels. A
two-dimensional ice-filling (2DIF) algorithm is proposed to efficiently
accomplish this objective. The algorithm is motivated by the fact that the
eigenspace of MIMO channel covariance can be decoupled into two
sub-eigenspaces, which are associated with the correlations of transmitter
antennas and receiver antennas, respectively. By properly setting the precoder
and the combiner as the eigenvectors from these two sub-eigenspaces, the 2DIF
promises to generate near-optimal observation matrices. Moreover, we further
extend the 2DIF method to the popular hybrid combining systems, where a
two-stage 2DIF (TS-2DIF) algorithm is developed to handle the analog combining
circuits realized by phase shifters. Simulation results demonstrate that,
compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed 2DIF and TS-2DIF methods
can achieve superior channel estimation accuracy.

extended to the case where side information is available to the guesser.
Furthermore, a connection between soft guessing allowing errors and

Motivation: Conventional iterative detectors like AMP and IGA suffer from high computational complexity that scales with BS antenna count, creating bottlenecks in XL-MIMO systems.

Method: Introduces cross matrix splitting of natural parameters in posterior distribution, enabling iterative detection based on matched filter. Extends to nonlinear detection (NCS-IGA) by embedding discrete constellation constraints for symbol-wise processing.

Result: CS-IGA matches or surpasses BER performance of Bayes optimal AMP and IGA for both linear and nonlinear detection, with fewer iterations and substantially lower computational cost.

Conclusion: CS-IGA is established as a practical and powerful solution for high-throughput signal detection in next-generation XL-MIMO systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the cross splitting based information geometry
approach (CS-IGA), a novel and low complexity iterative detector for uplink
signal recovery in extralarge-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems. Conventional
iterative detectors, such as the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm
and the traditional information geometry algorithm (IGA), suffer from a per
iteration complexity that scales with the number of base station (BS) antennas,
creating a computational bottleneck. To overcome this, CS-IGA introduces a
novel cross matrix splitting of the natural parameter in the a posteriori
distribution. This factorization allows the iterative detection based on the
matched filter, which reduces per iteration computational complexity.
Furthermore, we extend this framework to nonlinear detection and propose
nonlinear CSIGA (NCS-IGA) by seamlessly embedding discrete constellation
constraints, enabling symbol-wise processing without external interference
cancellation loops. Comprehensive simulations under realistic channel
conditions demonstrate that CS-IGA matches or surpasses the bit error rate
(BER) performance of Bayes optimal AMP and IGA for both linear and nonlinear
detection, while achieving this with fewer iterations and a substantially lower
computational cost. These results establish CS-IGA as a practical and powerful
solution for high-throughput signal detection in next generation XL-MIMO
systems.

Conclusion: The study successfully extends previous work by characterizing subfield codes over finite rings, discovering new distance-optimal code families, and demonstrating applications in constructing strongly regular graphs.

the parameters of $\mathcal{C}_D^{(2)}$ for various $D$, and identify several
infinite families of codes that are distance-optimal. Besides, we provide
sufficient conditions under which these codes are minimal and self-orthogonal.
Two families of strongly regular graphs are obtained as an application of the

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes a hybrid approach combining model-dependent and model-free methods for estimating delay-Doppler domain input-output relations in Zak-OTFS modulation, addressing limitations of pure model-free estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pure model-free approach only estimates effective channel in limited DD region, with performance degradation depending on DD pulse shape localization. Need to improve estimation beyond model-free region.

Method: Hybrid approach: uses model-free estimation for limited region + novel model-dependent scheme for coarse estimation outside that region, combining both for improved overall I/O relation estimation. Works for both exclusive and embedded pilot frames.

Result: Simulations with Vehicular-A, TDL-A and TDL-C channel models show superior performance compared to pure model-free approach, especially with fractional delay-Dopplers.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid estimation scheme effectively addresses the limitations of pure model-free approach by combining it with model-dependent estimation, achieving better overall performance in Zak-OTFS modulation.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the delay-Doppler (DD)
domain input-output (I/O) relation in Zak-OTFS modulation, which is needed for
signal detection. Two approaches, namely, model-dependent and model-free
approaches, can be employed for this purpose. The model-dependent approach
requires explicit estimation of the physical channel parameters (path delays,
Dopplers, and gains) to obtain the I/O relation. Such an explicit estimation is
not required in the model-free approach, where the I/O relation can be
estimated by reading off the samples in the fundamental DD period of the
received pilot frame. Model-free approach has the advantage of acquiring
fractional DD channels with simplicity. However, the read-off in the model-free
approach provides an estimate of the effective channel only over a limited
region in the DD plane but it does not provide an estimate for the region
outside, and this can affect the estimation performance depending on the pulse
shaping characteristics of the DD pulse shaping filter used. A poorly localized
DD pulse shape leads to an increased degradation in performance. Motivated by
this, in this paper, we propose a novel, yet simple, I/O relation estimation
scheme that alleviates the above issue in the model-free approach. We achieve
this by obtaining a coarse estimate of the effective channel outside the
model-free estimation region using a novel model-dependent scheme and using
this estimate along with the model-free estimate to obtain an improved estimate
of the overall I/O relation. We devise the proposed estimation scheme for both
exclusive and embedded pilot frames. Our simulation results using Vehicular-A,
TDL-A and TDL-C channel models with fractional DDs show that the proposed
hybrid estimation approach achieves superior performance compared to the pure
model-free approach.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes a novel PUF coding scheme using Polar codes with low-complexity automorphism ensemble decoding that achieves 1.75x fewer codeword bits than BCH codes while maintaining the same block error rate of 10^-6.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical unclonable functions require extremely low failure rates (10^-6) despite high raw input bit error rates (up to 22%), calling for efficient ultra-low rate code designs.

Method: Uses Polar codes with serial automorphism ensemble decoding that reuses a single successive cancellation decoder across multiple attempts. Implements cascaded and recursive interleavers to scale decoding candidates without large multiplexers, and uses aggressive 3-bit quantization.

Result: Achieves same block error rate of 10^-6 as BCH baseline while requiring 1.75x fewer codeword bits for K=312 payload bits, reducing helper data storage and chip area.

Conclusion: The proposed Polar code with low-complexity AED provides an efficient solution for PUF applications, significantly reducing storage requirements and chip area while maintaining reliability.

Abstract: Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) involve challenging practical
applications of error-correcting codes (ECCs), requiring extremely low failure
rates on the order of $10^{-6}$ and below despite raw input bit error rates as
high as 22%. These requirements call for an efficient ultra-low rate code
design. In this work, we propose a novel coding scheme tailored for PUFs based
on Polar codes and a low-complexity version of automorphism ensemble decoding
(AED). Notably, our serial AED scheme reuses a single successive cancellation
(SC) decoder across multiple decoding attempts. By introducing cascaded and
recursive interleavers, we efficiently scale the number of AED candidates
without requiring expensive large multiplexers. An aggressive quantization
strategy of only 3 bits per message further reduces the area requirements of
the underlying SC decoder. The resulting coding scheme achieves the same block
error rate of $10^{-6}$ as our baseline based on Bose-Ray-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem
(BCH) codes while requiring 1.75x fewer codeword bits to encode the same K =
312 payload bits. This reduction translates directly into 1.75x less helper
data storage and, consequently, a smaller overall chip area.

Conclusion: The findings raise questions about the practicality and cost of large-scale RIS adoption despite the demonstrated coverage improvements.

Abstract: This work introduces a fully-automated RIS deployment strategy validated
through a digital twin, powered by Sionna ray tracing, of a UK city. On a scene
calibrated with measured data, the method jointly optimizes RIS placement,
orientation, configuration, and BS beamforming across 4G, 5G, and hypothetical
6G frequencies. Candidate RIS sites are identified via scattering-based rays,
while user clustering reduces deployment overhead. Results show that meaningful
coverage enhancement requires dense, large-aperture RIS deployments, raising
questions about the practicality and cost of large-scale RIS adoption.

### [271] [Precoder Design in Multi-User FDD Systems with VQ-VAE and GNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09495)
*Srikar Allaparapu,Michael Baur,Benedikt B√∂ck,Michael Joham,Wolfgang Utschick*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes using a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) with graph neural networks (GNNs) for robust precoding in FDD systems, enabling end-to-end training and reducing the exponential scaling issue of previous GMM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in FDD systems where the number of GMM components scales exponentially with feedback bits, and to enable joint training of system components for better performance.

Method: Uses a VQ-VAE combined with GNNs to create an end-to-end model that jointly trains the neural network with pilot optimization, replacing the problematic GMM component scaling.

Result: The proposed framework achieves considerable performance gains in sum rate for multi-user wireless systems, outperforming conventional methods with sub-DFT pilot matrices and iterative precoder algorithms.

Conclusion: The VQ-VAE-based approach enables deployment of systems with fewer pilots or feedback bits while maintaining superior performance compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Robust precoding is efficiently feasible in frequency division duplex (FDD)
systems by incorporating the learnt statistics of the propagation environment
through a generative model. We build on previous work that successfully
designed site-specific precoders based on a combination of Gaussian mixture
models (GMMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). In this paper, by utilizing a
vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we circumvent one of the key
drawbacks of GMMs, i.e., the number of GMM components scales exponentially to
the feedback bits. In addition, the deep learning architecture of the VQ-VAE
allows us to jointly train the GNN together with VQ-VAE along with pilot
optimization forming an end-to-end (E2E) model, resulting in considerable
performance gains in sum rate for multi-user wireless systems. Simulations
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed frameworks over the conventional
methods involving the sub-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) pilot matrix and
iterative precoder algorithms enabling the deployment of systems characterized
by fewer pilots or feedback bits.

### [272] [Interlaced dynamic XCT reconstruction with spatio-temporal implicit neural representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08641)
*Mathias Boulanger,Ericmoore Jossou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Spatio-temporal implicit neural representations combined with ADMM optimization and INCODE conditioning framework for dynamic X-ray CT reconstruction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating robustness to noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address dynamic X-ray computed tomography reconstruction under interlaced acquisition schemes, aiming for efficient convergence and robust performance across various undersampling conditions and noise levels.

Method: Combines ADMM-based optimization with INCODE conditioning framework, uses spatio-temporal implicit neural representations, incorporates weighted least squares data fidelity for noise handling, and models detector non-idealities with ring artifact correction.

Result: Outperforms Time-Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (TIMBIR) across all acquisition scenarios, shows good robustness to moderate noise, and successfully demonstrates 4D volumetric reconstruction through joint optimization of batched axial slices.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides strong performance, modularity for practical applications, and enables massive parallelization for large-scale datasets through its joint optimization framework.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of spatio-temporalImplicit Neural
Representations (INRs) for dynamic X-ray computed tomography (XCT)
reconstruction under interlaced acquisition schemes. The proposed approach
combines ADMM-based optimization with INCODE, a conditioning framework
incorporating prior knowledge, to enable efficient convergence. We evaluate our
method under diverse acquisition scenarios, varying the severity of global
undersampling, spatial complexity (quantified via spatial information), and
noise levels. Across all settings, our model achieves strong performance and
outperforms Time-Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (TIMBIR), a
state-of-the-art model-based iterative method. In particular, we show that the
inductive bias of the INR provides good robustness to moderate noise levels,
and that introducing explicit noise modeling through a weighted least squares
data fidelity term significantly improves performance in more challenging
regimes. The final part of this work explores extensions toward a practical
reconstruction framework. We demonstrate the modularity of our approach by
explicitly modeling detector non-idealities, incorporating ring artifact
correction directly within the reconstruction process. Additionally, we present
a proof-of-concept 4D volumetric reconstruction by jointly optimizing over
batched axial slices, an approach which opens up the possibilities for massive
parallelization, a critical feature for processing large-scale datasets.

*Zhen Yang,Yansong Ma,Lei Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes Evidential U-KAN with PEUA mechanism and SAEL strategy for trustworthy medical image segmentation, achieving superior accuracy and reliability by leveraging uncertainty maps and preserving critical semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EDL-based methods neglect using uncertainty maps to refine ambiguous boundary segmentation and suppress evidence of incorrect classes indiscriminately, impairing uncertainty assessment in ambiguous areas.

Method: Introduces PEUA mechanism to progressively refine attention using uncertainty maps with low-rank learning, and SAEL strategy with semantic-smooth evidence generator and fidelity-enhancing regularization to retain critical semantics.

Result: Extensive experiments on 4 datasets demonstrate superior accuracy and reliability over competing methods.

Conclusion: Evidential U-KAN provides a novel solution for trustworthy medical image segmentation by effectively leveraging uncertainty guidance and preserving semantic information.

Abstract: Trustworthy medical image segmentation aims at deliver accurate and reliable
results for clinical decision-making. Most existing methods adopt the evidence
deep learning (EDL) paradigm due to its computational efficiency and
theoretical robustness. However, the EDL-based methods often neglect leveraging
uncertainty maps rich in attention cues to refine ambiguous boundary
segmentation. To address this, we propose a progressive evidence uncertainty
guided attention (PEUA) mechanism to guide the model to focus on the feature
representation learning of hard regions. Unlike conventional approaches, PEUA
progressively refines attention using uncertainty maps while employing low-rank
learning to denoise attention weights, enhancing feature learning for
challenging regions. Concurrently, standard EDL methods suppress evidence of
incorrect class indiscriminately via Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization,
impairing the uncertainty assessment in ambiguous areas and consequently
distorts the corresponding attention guidance. We thus introduce a
semantic-preserving evidence learning (SAEL) strategy, integrating a
semantic-smooth evidence generator and a fidelity-enhancing regularization term
to retain critical semantics. Finally, by embedding PEUA and SAEL with the
state-of-the-art U-KAN, we proposes Evidential U-KAN, a novel solution for
trustworthy medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets
demonstrate superior accuracy and reliability over the competing methods. The

### [274] [FS-RWKV: Leveraging Frequency Spatial-Aware RWKV for 3T-to-7T MRI Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08951)
*Yingtie Lei,Zimeng Li,Chi-Man Pun,Yupeng Liu,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FS-RWKV is a novel framework for synthesizing 7T-quality MRI images from 3T acquisitions using RWKV architecture with frequency-spatial modules to enhance global context and preserve anatomical details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI provides superior image quality but has limited availability due to high costs and technical demands. There's a need for computational methods to generate 7T-quality images from more accessible 3T scanners, overcoming limitations of existing CNN and Transformer approaches.

Method: Proposed FS-RWKV framework with two key modules: FSO-Shift (Frequency-Spatial Omnidirectional Shift) using wavelet decomposition and spatial shifting for global context, and SFEB (Structural Fidelity Enhancement Block) for frequency-aware feature fusion to preserve anatomical structures.

Result: FS-RWKV consistently outperformed CNN-, Transformer-, GAN-, and RWKV-based baselines on UNC and BNU datasets across T1w and T2w modalities, achieving superior anatomical fidelity and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The FS-RWKV framework effectively addresses the challenge of synthesizing high-quality 7T MRI images from 3T acquisitions, providing a computationally efficient solution with excellent anatomical preservation and global contrast recovery.

Abstract: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers enhanced spatial resolution and tissue
contrast that enables the detection of subtle pathological changes in
neurological disorders. However, the limited availability of 7T scanners
restricts widespread clinical adoption due to substantial infrastructure costs
and technical demands. Computational approaches for synthesizing 7T-quality
images from accessible 3T acquisitions present a viable solution to this
accessibility challenge. Existing CNN approaches suffer from limited spatial
coverage, while Transformer models demand excessive computational overhead.
RWKV architectures offer an efficient alternative for global feature modeling
in medical image synthesis, combining linear computational complexity with
strong long-range dependency capture. Building on this foundation, we propose
Frequency Spatial-RWKV (FS-RWKV), an RWKV-based framework for 3T-to-7T MRI
translation. To better address the challenges of anatomical detail preservation
and global tissue contrast recovery, FS-RWKV incorporates two key modules: (1)
Frequency-Spatial Omnidirectional Shift (FSO-Shift), which performs discrete
wavelet decomposition followed by omnidirectional spatial shifting on the
low-frequency branch to enhance global contextual representation while
preserving high-frequency anatomical details; and (2) Structural Fidelity
Enhancement Block (SFEB), a module that adaptively reinforces anatomical
structure through frequency-aware feature fusion. Comprehensive experiments on
UNC and BNU datasets demonstrate that FS-RWKV consistently outperforms existing
CNN-, Transformer-, GAN-, and RWKV-based baselines across both T1w and T2w
modalities, achieving superior anatomical fidelity and perceptual quality.

### [275] [SAM2-3dMed: Empowering SAM2 for 3D Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08967)
*Yeqing Yang,Le Xu,Lixia Tian*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SAM2-3dMed adapts the Segment Anything Model 2 for 3D medical imaging by addressing domain gaps through bidirectional slice dependency modeling and boundary enhancement, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of SAM2 to 3D medical images faces domain gaps: bidirectional anatomical continuity vs unidirectional temporal flow in videos, and the need for precise boundary delineation crucial for medical analysis.

Method: Proposes SAM2-3dMed with two innovations: 1) Slice Relative Position Prediction (SRPP) module for bidirectional inter-slice dependencies via self-supervised position prediction, 2) Boundary Detection (BD) module for enhanced segmentation accuracy at critical boundaries.

Result: Extensive experiments on three MSD datasets (Lung, Spleen, Pancreas) show SAM2-3dMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation overlap and boundary precision.

Conclusion: The approach advances 3D medical image segmentation and provides a general paradigm for adapting video-centric foundation models to spatial volumetric data.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of 3D medical images is critical for clinical
applications like disease assessment and treatment planning. While the Segment
Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has shown remarkable success in video object
segmentation by leveraging temporal cues, its direct application to 3D medical
images faces two fundamental domain gaps: 1) the bidirectional anatomical
continuity between slices contrasts sharply with the unidirectional temporal
flow in videos, and 2) precise boundary delineation, crucial for morphological
analysis, is often underexplored in video tasks. To bridge these gaps, we
propose SAM2-3dMed, an adaptation of SAM2 for 3D medical imaging. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: 1) a Slice Relative Position Prediction (SRPP)
module explicitly models bidirectional inter-slice dependencies by guiding SAM2
to predict the relative positions of different slices in a self-supervised
manner; 2) a Boundary Detection (BD) module enhances segmentation accuracy
along critical organ and tissue boundaries. Extensive experiments on three
diverse medical datasets (the Lung, Spleen, and Pancreas in the Medical
Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset) demonstrate that SAM2-3dMed significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in
segmentation overlap and boundary precision. Our approach not only advances 3D
medical image segmentation performance but also offers a general paradigm for
adapting video-centric foundation models to spatial volumetric data.

*Alemu Sisay Nigru,Michele Svanera,Austin Dibble,Connor Dalby,Mattia Savardi,Sergio Benini*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: LODi is a framework that adapts adult brain MRI segmentation models to infant scans using transfer learning and domain adaptation, achieving superior performance through hierarchical feature refinement and multi-level consistency constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infant brain MRI segmentation is challenging due to evolving anatomy, motion artifacts, and limited labeled data. Leveraging abundant adult brain MRI data can help overcome these challenges.

Method: Pre-train segmentation model on adult brain MRI data, then adapt to infant scans (0-2 years) using weakly supervised learning with FreeSurfer silver-standard labels, incorporating hierarchical feature refinement and multi-level consistency constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments show superiority over traditional supervised learning and domain-specific models, with improved accuracy and reduced scanner/site biases.

Conclusion: Leveraging adult brain priors provides a foundation for age-flexible neuroimaging analysis, enabling more reliable and generalizable brain MRI segmentation across the lifespan.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of infant brain MRI is critical for studying early
neurodevelopment and diagnosing neurological disorders. Yet, it remains a
fundamental challenge due to continuously evolving anatomy of the subjects,
motion artifacts, and the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. In this work,
we present LODi, a novel framework that utilizes prior knowledge from an adult
brain MRI segmentation model to enhance the segmentation performance of infant
scans. Given the abundance of publicly available adult brain MRI data, we
pre-train a segmentation model on a large adult dataset as a starting point.
Through transfer learning and domain adaptation strategies, we progressively
adapt the model to the 0-2 year-old population, enabling it to account for the
anatomical and imaging variability typical of infant scans. The adaptation of
the adult model is carried out using weakly supervised learning on infant brain
scans, leveraging silver-standard ground truth labels obtained with FreeSurfer.
By introducing a novel training strategy that integrates hierarchical feature
refinement and multi-level consistency constraints, our method enables fast,
accurate, age-adaptive segmentation, while mitigating scanner and site-specific
biases. Extensive experiments on both internal and external datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional supervised
learning and domain-specific models. Our findings highlight the advantage of
leveraging adult brain priors as a foundation for age-flexible neuroimaging
analysis, paving the way for more reliable and generalizable brain MRI
segmentation across the lifespan.

*Romario Zarik,Nahum Kiryati,Michael Green,Liran Domachevsky,Arnaldo Mayer*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes training segmentation models directly on PET MIPs instead of 3D volumes, achieving comparable performance with 55.8-75.8% faster training, 71.7-76% lower energy consumption, and two orders of magnitude fewer TFLOPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PET/CT tumor detection workflow using rotational MIPs is time-consuming, and MIPs are underutilized in automated segmentation despite their clinical utility. 3D volumetric segmentation is computationally intensive.

Method: Train segmentation models directly on MIPs rather than 3D volumes, with a novel occlusion correction method to restore MIP annotations occluded by high-intensity structures. Evaluated on autoPET 2022 dataset.

Result: MIP-based approach achieves segmentation performance comparable to 3D (‚â§1% Dice difference, 26.7% better Hausdorff Distance) with 55.8-75.8% faster training, 71.7-76% lower energy per epoch, and two orders of magnitude fewer TFLOPs. For classification, 16 MIPs outperform 3D with 10x faster training and 93.35% lower energy consumption.

Conclusion: Training directly on MIPs provides substantial computational efficiency gains while maintaining performance, making it highly scalable for clinical use. 48 MIP views offer the optimal balance between performance and efficiency.

Abstract: PET/CT imaging is the gold standard for tumor detection, offering high
accuracy in identifying local and metastatic lesions. Radiologists often begin
assessment with rotational Multi-Angle Maximum Intensity Projections (MIPs)
from PET, confirming findings with volumetric slices. This workflow is
time-consuming, especially in metastatic cases. Despite their clinical utility,
MIPs are underutilized in automated tumor segmentation, where 3D volumetric
data remains the norm. We propose an alternative approach that trains
segmentation models directly on MIPs, bypassing the need to segment 3D volumes
and then project. This better aligns the model with its target domain and
yields substantial gains in computational efficiency and training time. We also
introduce a novel occlusion correction method that restores MIP annotations
occluded by high-intensity structures, improving segmentation. Using the
autoPET 2022 Grand Challenge dataset, we evaluate our method against standard
3D pipelines in terms of performance and training/computation efficiency for
segmentation and classification, and analyze how MIP count affects
segmentation. Our MIP-based approach achieves segmentation performance on par
with 3D (<=1% Dice difference, 26.7% better Hausdorff Distance), while reducing
training time (convergence time) by 55.8-75.8%, energy per epoch by 71.7-76%,
and TFLOPs by two orders of magnitude, highlighting its scalability for
clinical use. For classification, using 16 MIPs only as input, we surpass 3D
performance while reducing training time by over 10x and energy consumption per
epoch by 93.35%. Our analysis of the impact of MIP count on segmentation
identified 48 views as optimal, offering the best trade-off between performance
and efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support clinical and research applications by enabling MRI inpainting through generative modeling that can handle both tumor synthesis and healthy tissue restoration.

Method: Latent diffusion model conditioned on both tissue segmentations and continuous tumor concentrations to generate 3D spatially coherent and anatomically consistent images.

Result: Achieved PSNR of 18.5 for healthy inpainting and 17.4 for tumor inpainting, demonstrating high-fidelity image generation for both tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed generative model successfully performs both tumor synthesis and healthy tissue restoration in brain MRIs, providing a versatile solution for MRI inpainting applications.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inpainting supports numerous clinical and
research applications. We introduce the first generative model that conditions
on voxel-level, continuous tumor concentrations to synthesize high-fidelity
brain tumor MRIs. For the BraTS 2025 Inpainting Challenge, we adapt this
architecture to the complementary task of healthy tissue restoration by setting
the tumor concentrations to zero. Our latent diffusion model conditioned on
both tissue segmentations and the tumor concentrations generates 3D spatially
coherent and anatomically consistent images for both tumor synthesis and
healthy tissue inpainting. For healthy inpainting, we achieve a PSNR of 18.5,
and for tumor inpainting, we achieve 17.4. Our code is available at:
