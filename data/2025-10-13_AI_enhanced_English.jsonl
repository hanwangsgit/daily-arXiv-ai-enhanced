While multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and\nsystematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as\nexisting benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or\nspatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive\nand fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied\ncapabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across\n14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory\nunderstanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation\nresults of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across\nall domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose\nBEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision\nmodels to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning\ncapabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse\nembodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative\nimprovement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that\nimproving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated\nenvironments.

We evaluate our\nmethod on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.\nFirst, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task\nusing synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample\nsettings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks\nwhich simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we\ndeploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it\ncan not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also\npredict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding\nchallenge in computational biology.", "AI": {"tldr": "MODE is a graphical modeling framework that uses neural gating to decompose complex biological dynamics into sparse, interpretable components, enabling unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and accurate forecasting across noisy transitions.", "motivation": "Traditional flow-based modeling techniques struggle with complex, overlapping behavioral regimes in life sciences where transitions between regimes appear noisy and irregular, requiring a method that can handle discontinuous dynamics.", "method": "Proposed MODE (Mixture Of Dynamical Experts) framework with neural gating mechanism that allows agents to jump between different governing laws, decomposing complex dynamics into sparse components for regime discovery and forecasting.", "result": "Successfully benchmarked on synthetic data for unsupervised classification, demonstrated accurate forecasting on cell biology processes, and deployed on human single-cell RNA sequencing data to distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics and predict cell fate commitment.", "conclusion": "MODE effectively addresses the challenge of modeling complex, overlapping behavioral regimes with noisy transitions in biological systems, providing both interpretable regime discovery and accurate long-term forecasting capabilities."}}
