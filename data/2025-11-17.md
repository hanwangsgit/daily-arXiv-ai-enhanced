### [1] [A Mathematical Framework for AI Singularity: Conditions, Bounds, and Control of Recursive Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10668)
*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops an analytical framework to determine when AI capability growth could escalate without bound (runaway growth) versus when it can be bounded, providing testable conditions and practical safety controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replace speculation about AI runaway growth with precise, testable conditions that can determine when capability escalation could become unbounded in finite time versus when it can be ruled out.

Method: Develops an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement linking capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Uses physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory to define a service envelope. Creates an endogenous growth model coupling capital to compute, data, and energy with decision rules based on observable metrics.

Result: Derives falsifiable tests based on acceleration rates relative to current improvement levels. Provides directly implementable safety controls including power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies demonstrate when the envelope binds and when it doesn't.

Conclusion: The framework replaces speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity, though limitations exist regarding capability metrics and regularity diagnostics.

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

Abstract: CAR-Scenes is a frame-level dataset for autonomous driving that enables training and evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs) for interpretable, scene-level understanding. We annotate 5,192 images drawn from Argoverse 1, Cityscapes, KITTI, and nuScenes using a 28-key category/sub-category knowledge base covering environment, road geometry, background-vehicle behavior, ego-vehicle behavior, vulnerable road users, sensor states, and a discrete severity scale (1-10), totaling 350+ leaf attributes. Labels are produced by a GPT-4o-assisted vision-language pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification; we release the exact prompts, post-processing rules, and per-field baseline model performance. CAR-Scenes also provides attribute co-occurrence graphs and JSONL records that support semantic retrieval, dataset triage, and risk-aware scenario mining across sources. To calibrate task difficulty, we include reproducible, non-benchmark baselines, notably a LoRA-tuned Qwen2-VL-2B with deterministic decoding, evaluated via scalar accuracy, micro-averaged F1 for list attributes, and severity MAE/RMSE on a fixed validation split. We publicly release the annotation and analysis scripts, including graph construction and evaluation scripts, to enable explainable, data-centric workflows for future intelligent vehicles.

Conclusion: Represents a meaningful step towards large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models like Stable Diffusion by making attribution practical and efficient.

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

Method: Used Delphi process to achieve consensus on workflow descriptors, developed ColoWorkflow tool, applied it to multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgeries, and evaluated applicability and inter-rater reliability.

Result: Achieved consensus for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps. Tool demonstrated broad applicability with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies occurred at phase transitions and step boundaries.

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive colorectal surgery, enabling standardized training, benchmarking, and supporting AI-driven workflow recognition.

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

To do so, we propose a ray-tracing algorithm that computes 3D line integrals with arbitrary projection geometries. One of the components of our algorithm is a neural network that computes the contribution of the basis functions efficiently. In our experiments, we consider well-posed cases where the data are sufficient for accurate reconstruction without the need for regularization. We achieve higher reconstruction quality than traditional voxel-based methods.

### [6] [Frequency-Aware Vision-Language Multimodality Generalization Network for Remote Sensing Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10774)
*Junjie Zhang,Feng Zhao,Hanqiang Liu,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FVMGN is a frequency-aware vision-language network for remote sensing image classification that addresses multimodal generalization by using frequency domain processing, diffusion-based augmentation, and unified semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing faces challenges with multimodal data heterogeneity and lack of domain-specific linguistic knowledge in vision-language models, requiring improved cross-scene generalization.

Method: Uses diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation, multimodal wavelet disentanglement for frequency domain features, spatial-frequency-aware image encoder, and multiscale spatial-frequency feature alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show FVMGN achieves excellent multimodality generalization ability compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed FVMGN framework effectively addresses remote sensing multimodal generalization through frequency-aware processing and unified semantic alignment.

Abstract: The booming remote sensing (RS) technology is giving rise to a novel multimodality generalization task, which requires the model to overcome data heterogeneity while possessing powerful cross-scene generalization ability. Moreover, most vision-language models (VLMs) usually describe surface materials in RS images using universal texts, lacking proprietary linguistic prior knowledge specific to different RS vision modalities. In this work, we formalize RS multimodality generalization (RSMG) as a learning paradigm, and propose a frequency-aware vision-language multimodality generalization network (FVMGN) for RS image classification. Specifically, a diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation (DTAug) strategy is designed to reconstruct multimodal land-cover distributions, enriching input information for FVMGN. Following that, to overcome multimodal heterogeneity, a multimodal wavelet disentanglement (MWDis) module is developed to learn cross-domain invariant features by resampling low and high frequency components in the frequency domain. Considering the characteristics of RS vision modalities, shared and proprietary class texts is designed as linguistic inputs for the transformer-based text encoder to extract diverse text features. For multimodal vision inputs, a spatial-frequency-aware image encoder (SFIE) is constructed to realize local-global feature reconstruction and representation. Finally, a multiscale spatial-frequency feature alignment (MSFFA) module is suggested to construct a unified semantic space, ensuring refined multiscale alignment of different text and vision features in spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experiments show that FVMGN has the excellent multimodality generalization ability compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: GFT is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for point cloud data that uses dynamic graph features and cross-attention to reduce trainable parameters while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To further reduce trainable parameters in point cloud fine-tuning beyond existing PEFT methods, as general approaches are suboptimal for point cloud data.

Method: Learns dynamic graphs from initial transformer tokenized inputs using lightweight graph convolution, then passes graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules.

Result: Extensive experiments on object classification and segmentation show GFT rivals existing methods while reducing trainable parameters.

Conclusion: GFT provides an effective point-cloud-specific PEFT approach that significantly reduces parameter count while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) significantly reduces computational and memory costs by updating only a small subset of the model's parameters, enabling faster adaptation to new tasks with minimal loss in performance. Previous studies have introduced PEFTs tailored for point cloud data, as general approaches are suboptimal. To further reduce the number of trainable parameters, we propose a point-cloud-specific PEFT, termed Graph Features Tuning (GFT), which learns a dynamic graph from initial tokenized inputs of the transformer using a lightweight graph convolution network and passes these graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules. Extensive experiments on object classification and segmentation tasks show that GFT operates in the same domain, rivalling existing methods, while reducing the trainable parameters.

Result: Achieved higher pruning rates while preserving model accuracy better than existing LRP-based pruning methods, particularly effective in scenarios with limited data.

Conclusion: The proposed LRP-based pruning method successfully addresses the accuracy degradation issues of existing approaches, making it more practical for real-world applications with limited computing resources and data.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for efficient cross-modal fusion due to challenges in unbalanced category distribution, complex facial action unit modeling, and modal heterogeneity in multimodal emotion recognition.

Method: Uses Multimodal Cross-Attention Network with triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving emotional cues.

Conclusion: MCN-CL effectively addresses modal heterogeneity and category imbalance in multimodal emotion recognition through cross-attention and contrastive learning.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition plays a key role in many domains, including mental health monitoring, educational interaction, and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often face three major challenges: unbalanced category distribution, the complexity of dynamic facial action unit time modeling, and the difficulty of feature fusion due to modal heterogeneity. With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition. It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance. Experiment results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with Weighted F1 scores improving by 3.42% and 5.73%, respectively.

Conclusion: YOLO-Drone is a high-performance model with enhanced accuracy and speed for drone-based object detection.

Abstract: Object detection using images or videos captured by drones is a promising technology with significant potential across various industries. However, a major challenge is that drone images are typically taken from high altitudes, making object identification difficult. This paper proposes an effective solution to address this issue. The base model used in the experiments is YOLOv11, the latest object detection model, with a specific implementation based on YOLOv11n. The experimental data were sourced from the widely used and reliable VisDrone dataset, a standard benchmark in drone-based object detection. This paper introduces an enhancement to the Head network of the YOLOv11 algorithm, called the GhostHead Network. The model incorporating this improvement is named YOLO-Drone. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-Drone achieves significant improvements in key detection accuracy metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and mAP (0.5), compared to the original YOLOv11. Specifically, the proposed model recorded a 0.4% increase in Precision, a 0.6% increase in Recall, a 0.5% increase in F1-Score, and a 0.5% increase in mAP (0.5). Additionally, the Inference Speed metric, which measures image processing speed, also showed a notable improvement.

*Zihan Gu,Ruoyu Chen,Junchi Zhang,Yue Hu,Hua Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhaseWin is a phase-window search algorithm for efficient object-level foundation model attribution, achieving near-linear complexity while maintaining high faithfulness comparable to greedy methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing submodular subset selection methods for attribution achieve high faithfulness but suffer from efficiency limitations that hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

Method: PhaseWin replaces quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search approach, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to approximate greedy behavior with dramatically fewer model evaluations.

Result: PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2.

Conclusion: PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models, enabling practical deployment with near-linear complexity.

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

### [14] [Out-of-Distribution Detection with Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10923)
*Zhixia He,Chen Zhao,Minglai Shao,Xintao Wu,Xujiang Zhao,Dong Li,Qin Tian,Linlin Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision to enhance OOD detection by using LLM-initialized prompts that capture inter-class features and transfer semantic knowledge to visual modality via graph-based architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current negative prompts in vision-language models for OOD detection often include broad non-ID features, leading to suboptimal results due to overlapping or misleading information capture.

Method: Uses LLM-initialized class-specific positive/negative prompts optimized to focus on intra-class features and category boundaries, with graph-based architecture to aggregate semantic supervision and propagate to visual branch for energy-based OOD detection.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances OOD detection performance by better capturing inter-class features and transferring semantic knowledge between modalities.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Lightweight YOLO models effectively balance performance and efficiency, demonstrating adaptability across controlled and real-world conditions, making them strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

*Liuchi Xu,Hao Zheng,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD) is a novel knowledge distillation framework that effectively transfers knowledge from Vision Transformers to ResNets by integrating complementary features and using sub-logit decoupled distillation with orthogonality constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional knowledge distillation methods struggle with heterogeneous architectures (e.g., ViT to ResNet) due to differences in spatial feature representations. Existing heterogeneous KD approaches have high computational costs, complex designs, or over-rely on logit alignment, limiting their ability to leverage complementary features.

Method: HCD processes student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's penultimate layer features, and maps them via Complementary Feature Mapper to produce shared logits. It then uses Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation to partition shared logits into n sub-logits fused with teacher's logits, with Orthogonality Loss to ensure diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Fine-grained datasets (e.g., CUB200), and ImageNet-1K demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods.

Conclusion: HCD provides an effective solution for heterogeneous knowledge distillation by preserving student-specific strengths while leveraging teacher knowledge, enhancing robustness and generalization in student models.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

TL;DR: FedBCS addresses feature heterogeneity in federated medical image segmentation by aligning domain-invariant contextual prototypes across multiple layers, using frequency-domain style recalibration and dual-level prototype alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature heterogeneity from diverse medical scanners/protocols in federated learning causes incomplete contextual representation learning (focusing only on final-layer features) and layerwise style bias accumulation that reduces model robustness.

Method: Proposes FedBCS with frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration for prototype construction to decouple content-style representations, and context-aware dual-level prototype alignment that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from both encoder and decoder layers.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate remarkable performance improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: FedBCS effectively bridges feature representation gaps in federated medical image segmentation through robust domain-invariant contextual prototype alignment.

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with 3D-related tasks due to the modality gap between their 2D training and 3D requirements, limiting their effectiveness in robotics and embodied agent applications.

Method: A 3D Sandbox reconstruction and perception pipeline with four stages: generating multi-view priors with abstract control, proxy elevation, multi-view voting and clustering, and 3D-aware reasoning using abstract bounding boxes.

Result: Achieved 8.3% improvement on SAT Real benchmark and consistent gains across multiple benchmarks and VLM backbones in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: Equipping VLMs with 3D abstraction substantially enhances their 3D reasoning ability without additional training, opening new possibilities for general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with 3D-related tasks such as spatial cognition and physical understanding, which are crucial for real-world applications like robotics and embodied agents. We attribute this to a modality gap between the 3D tasks and the 2D training of VLM, which led to inefficient retrieval of 3D information from 2D input. To bridge this gap, we introduce SandboxVLM, a simple yet effective framework that leverages abstract bounding boxes to encode geometric structure and physical kinematics for VLM. Specifically, we design a 3D Sandbox reconstruction and perception pipeline comprising four stages: generating multi-view priors with abstract control, proxy elevation, multi-view voting and clustering, and 3D-aware reasoning. Evaluated in zero-shot settings across multiple benchmarks and VLM backbones, our approach consistently improves spatial intelligence, achieving an 8.3\% gain on SAT Real compared with baseline methods for instance. These results demonstrate that equipping VLMs with a 3D abstraction substantially enhances their 3D reasoning ability without additional training, suggesting new possibilities for general-purpose embodied intelligence.

TL;DR: DEFT-LLM is a multimodal LLM for micro expression recognition that addresses motion-semantic misalignment through multi-expert disentanglement and a motion-driven instruction dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MER methods struggle with entangled static/dynamic cues and semantic gaps between text labels and actual facial muscle movements, limiting accurate interpretation of subtle emotions.

Method: Proposes DEFT-LLM with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics, using Uni-MER dataset with optical flow and AU constraints for motion-text alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple MER benchmarks and demonstrates superior interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

Conclusion: The approach effectively injects physical priors for micro expressions while leveraging LLM reasoning, enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues through motion-semantic alignment.

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing methods in capturing global dependencies in video content and accommodating multimodal user customization, while noting that temporal proximity doesn't always correspond to semantic proximity.

Method: Uses video graph generator to convert frames into structured graphs (forward, backward, undirected), intra-graph relational reasoning with dual-threshold graph convolution, and language-guided cross-modal embedding. Models summary generation as mixture of Bernoulli distribution solved with EM algorithm.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks, reduces inference time by 87.8% and model parameters by 91.7%.

Conclusion: LGRLN effectively addresses video summarization challenges by leveraging graph representation learning and language guidance, achieving superior performance with high efficiency.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video content on social media, video summarization has become a crucial task in multimedia processing. However, existing methods face challenges in capturing global dependencies in video content and accommodating multimodal user customization. Moreover, temporal proximity between video frames does not always correspond to semantic proximity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Language-guided Graph Representation Learning Network (LGRLN) for video summarization. Specifically, we introduce a video graph generator that converts video frames into a structured graph to preserve temporal order and contextual dependencies. By constructing forward, backward and undirected graphs, the video graph generator effectively preserves the sequentiality and contextual relationships of video content. We designed an intra-graph relational reasoning module with a dual-threshold graph convolution mechanism, which distinguishes semantically relevant frames from irrelevant ones between nodes. Additionally, our proposed language-guided cross-modal embedding module generates video summaries with specific textual descriptions. We model the summary generation output as a mixture of Bernoulli distribution and solve it with the EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, we proposed LGRLN reduces inference time and model parameters by 87.8% and 91.7%, respectively. Our codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/LGRLN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenge of many-to-one labeling in DFER where videos with multiple frames get single emotion labels, and to overcome limitations of Multiple Instance Learning approaches that struggle with visual diversity and temporal complexity.

Method: Uses vision-language pre-trained models for semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions, visual prompts to align text with visual features, and multi-grained temporal network to capture both short-term dynamics and long-range emotional flow.

Result: The framework achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision, demonstrating enhanced performance in dynamic facial expression recognition.

Conclusion: TG-DFER effectively addresses DFER challenges by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling, providing a robust solution for weakly supervised dynamic facial expression analysis.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) aims to identify emotional states by modeling the temporal changes in facial movements across video sequences. A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time. Extensive results demonstrate that TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERMoE is a sparse Mixture-of-Experts transformer that uses eigenbasis-based routing to stabilize expert utilization and improve specialization without explicit load balancing losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MoE architectures face challenges with misaligned router logits causing unstable routing and expert underutilization, while load balancing solutions often weaken expert specialization and hurt performance.

Method: Reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an 'Eigenbasis Score' based on cosine similarity between input features and expert's basis.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks, produces flatter expert load distributions naturally, and improves brain age prediction accuracy by over 7% with anatomically interpretable expert specializations.

Conclusion: ERMoE introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

*Haoran Chen,Houze Xu,Micah Goldblum,Daoguo Dong,Zuxuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMC is a two-stage framework for CLIP-based class-incremental learning that decouples vision encoder adaptation from textual prompt optimization, with DMC-OT adding optimal-transport calibration to handle distributional drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending vision-language models like CLIP to continual learning is challenging due to classifier bias from task-specific prompts and distributional drift when vision encoders are updated over time.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) adapt vision encoder with frozen text prompts, 2) optimize textual soft prompts with frozen vision encoder. DMC-OT adds optimal-transport guided calibration for memory statistics alignment and task-specific prompting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101, with DMC-OT improving accuracy by average 1.80% over DMC.

Conclusion: Decoupling vision and text adaptation preserves cross-modal alignment in continual learning, and optimal-transport calibration effectively handles distributional drift in evolving encoders.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAS addresses temporal instability in Video LLMs by smoothing the temporal kernel through multi-phase aggregation, improving robustness to frame timing shifts without changing positional encoding structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency where small frame timing shifts can flip attention and suppress relevant frames, traced to multimodal RoPE's inverse Fourier time kernel causing frame-scale ripples.

Method: Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS) applies small opposed phase offsets across attention heads and aggregates their outputs, smoothing the temporal kernel while preserving per-head spectrum magnitude.

Result: Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead under matched token budgets.

Conclusion: PAS provides a plug-and-play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs, achieving Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts.

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

TL;DR: A training-free binary verification workflow that converts open-ended vision queries into multiple-choice questions and then True/False verifications, improving zero-shot performance across various vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance zero-shot vision capabilities of off-the-shelf VLMs without requiring task-specific training, by leveraging inference-time design improvements.

Method: Two-step workflow: (1) quantization - convert open-ended queries to multiple-choice questions with explicit candidates; (2) binarization - ask True/False questions per candidate and resolve deterministically.

Result: Significant improvements across referring expression grounding, spatial reasoning tasks, and BLINK-Jigsaw. Quantization provides large gains, and binarization offers consistent additional boost.

Conclusion: The workflow provides a practical, drop-in solution for stronger zero-shot vision with current VLMs, emphasizing inference-time design over training.

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces HPAC, a practical autoregressive framework for learned lossless image compression that achieves state-of-the-art performance through hierarchical parallelism, progressive adaptation, and efficient optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models are theoretically optimal for lossless image compression but are often considered impractical due to high computational costs. This work aims to make pure autoregression practical and competitive.

Method: HPAC uses hierarchical factorized structure with content-aware convolutional gating, Cache-then-Select Inference for acceleration, Adaptive Focus Coding for high bit-depth images, and Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning for instance-level adaptation.

Result: The method achieves new state-of-the-art compression performance across diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) with small parameter count and competitive coding speeds.

Conclusion: A carefully designed autoregressive framework can offer significant compression gains over existing methods while being practical and efficient, re-establishing pure autoregression as a top-performing solution.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, the theoretical performance benchmark for learned lossless image compression, are often dismissed as impractical due to prohibitive computational cost. This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression. Notably, our approach sets a new benchmark in learned lossless compression, showing a carefully designed AR framework can offer significant gains over existing methods with a small parameter count and competitive coding speeds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLUE is a generative model framework that achieves diverse and stable image generation using fixed-format prompts without additional data, particularly effective for specialized domains like medicine with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image synthesis methods face limitations in specialized fields like medicine where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available, requiring a solution that can generate diverse images while maintaining stability without additional data.

Method: Based on Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE uses a Style Encoder to process images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are fed into a new second attention layer of U-Net. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, it achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions independent of prompts.

Result: On otitis media dataset, CLUE reduced FID from 46.81 to 9.30 and improved recall from 49.60% to 70.29%. Synthetic-only training at 1000% scale achieved F1 score of 83.21% vs 73.83%. Combined synthetic+real data achieved 94.76% F1 score, higher than real-only data. External dataset testing showed similar improvements.

Conclusion: CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications, demonstrating superior performance in medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

Conclusion: PROMISE effectively bridges the representational gap between complete and incomplete multimodal data through its innovative prompt-attention hierarchical contrastive learning approach.

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

*Zongyang Qiu,Bingyuan Wang,Xingbei Chen,Yingqing He,Zeyu Wang*

TL;DR: EmoVid is the first multimodal emotion-annotated video dataset for creative media, enabling emotion-conditioned video generation that significantly improves both quantitative metrics and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation systems focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions, and there's a lack of dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, especially for stylized and non-realistic contexts.

Method: Created EmoVid dataset with emotion labels, visual attributes, and text captions; developed emotion-conditioned video generation by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model; conducted systematic analysis of spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions.

Result: Significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks; uncovered spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms.

Conclusion: EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing, providing valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos and practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

TL;DR: MeCaMIL is a causality-aware multiple instance learning framework that addresses fairness and interpretability limitations in whole slide image analysis by modeling demographic confounders through structured causal graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods lack causal interpretability and fail to integrate patient demographics, leading to fairness concerns and algorithmic bias that hinder clinical translation in computational pathology.

Method: Uses structured causal graphs with do-calculus and collider structures to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations, treating demographics as confounders rather than auxiliary features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks (CAMELYON16, TCGA-Lung, TCGA-Multi) with 65% relative reduction in demographic disparity variance and improved fairness for underserved populations. Also generalizes to survival prediction with improved C-index.

Conclusion: MeCaMIL establishes a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology, with causal graph structure being essential for both performance and fairness.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for whole slide image (WSI) analysis in computational pathology, achieving strong diagnostic performance through patch-level feature aggregation. However, existing MIL methods face critical limitations: (1) they rely on attention mechanisms that lack causal interpretability, and (2) they fail to integrate patient demographics (age, gender, race), leading to fairness concerns across diverse populations. These shortcomings hinder clinical translation, where algorithmic bias can exacerbate health disparities. We introduce \textbf{MeCaMIL}, a causality-aware MIL framework that explicitly models demographic confounders through structured causal graphs. Unlike prior approaches treating demographics as auxiliary features, MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference -- leveraging do-calculus and collider structures -- to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations. Extensive evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970, five cancer types). Critically, MeCaMIL achieves superior fairness -- demographic disparity variance drops by over 65% relative reduction on average across attributes, with notable improvements for underserved populations. The framework generalizes to survival prediction (mean C-index: 0.653, +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types). Ablation studies confirm causal graph structure is essential -- alternative designs yield 0.048 lower accuracy and 4.2x times worse fairness. These results establish MeCaMIL as a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: DnR is an agent framework that uses a question-conditioned utilization metric to quantify and improve LVLMs' reliance on visual evidence, reducing hallucinations without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce ungrounded responses by relying too much on linguistic priors instead of visual evidence, highlighting the need for quantitative measures of visual information utilization.

Method: Proposes Draft and Refine (DnR) framework with question-conditioned utilization metric that constructs relevance maps and uses relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Refines responses using external visual experts whose outputs are rendered as visual cues.

Result: Experiments show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination across VQA and captioning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.

Abstract: While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal reasoning abilities, they often produce ungrounded or hallucinated responses because they rely too heavily on linguistic priors instead of visual evidence. This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs suffer from visual processing bottlenecks where they lose grounding in visual evidence and lack contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation, inspired by human cognitive memory theory.

Method: Proposes VisMem framework with dynamic latent vision memories: short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation, seamlessly invoked during inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show VisMem delivers 11.8% average performance boost relative to vanilla models and outperforms all counterparts across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation.

Conclusion: VisMem establishes a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement in VLMs, maintaining both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP-Guard is a new method that improves safety in text-to-image generation by adaptively estimating prompt harmfulness and selectively guiding only unsafe image regions, outperforming existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based T2I models enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack adaptivity (adjusting guidance based on prompt) and selectivity (targeting only unsafe regions).

Method: SP-Guard estimates prompt harmfulness and applies a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas of the image, addressing both adaptivity and selectivity limitations.

Result: Experiments show SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration.

Conclusion: Beyond improving safety, the findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures like U-Net variants suffer from information loss that limits recovery of fine high-frequency details in inverse problems.

Method: Exploits perfect reconstruction property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing redundant features. Serves as plug-and-play decoder block for U-Net variants without rigid framelet constraints.

Result: Markedly improves thin-crack segmentation (cracks <4px) on CrackVision12K, achieves moderate PSNR gain in smartphone image denoising on SIDD. Maintains comparable computational cost while enriching representational diversity.

Conclusion: SUPER validates plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within unified reconstruction-aware framework, robust across low- and high-frequency regimes.

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on single-agent vision tasks and high-quality images, failing to evaluate MLLMs in complex egocentric collaborative scenarios under real-world degraded perception conditions, despite multi-drone systems offering enhanced coverage and robustness.

Method: Constructed benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control across four task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision.

Result: Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments confirm sim-to-real transfer feasibility.

Conclusion: AirCopBench addresses the critical gap in multi-agent collaborative perception evaluation and reveals substantial room for improvement in MLLMs' collaborative reasoning capabilities under challenging real-world conditions.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

TL;DR: EmbryoDiff is a two-stage diffusion-based framework for fine-grained embryo developmental stage classification that uses multi-focal feature fusion and hybrid semantic-boundary conditioning to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for embryo stage identification fail to utilize developmental distribution priors and rely on single-focal information, leading to incomplete representations and susceptibility to cell occlusion ambiguities.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Train frame-level encoder for multi-focal feature extraction, 2) Use Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy to create 3D-aware representations, then apply Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block in diffusion-based denoising process.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on two benchmark datasets using only a single denoising step.

Conclusion: The proposed EmbryoDiff framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by leveraging multi-focal information and diffusion-based sequence denoising for robust embryo stage classification.

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: AI models can predict patients' health insurance type (a socioeconomic proxy) from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy, revealing that medical images contain hidden social signatures of inequality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI models can detect invisible traces of social inequality in medical imaging data, challenging the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data.

Method: Used state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) trained on chest X-rays from MIMIC-CXR-JPG and CheXpert datasets, with patch-based occlusion analysis to localize the signal.

Result: Models achieved AUC around 0.67-0.68 in predicting health insurance type, with signal persisting after controlling for age, race, and sex. The signal is diffuse across upper and mid-thoracic regions rather than localized.

Conclusion: Medical AI fairness requires interrogating and disentangling social fingerprints embedded in clinical data, not just balancing datasets or adjusting thresholds.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) to improve efficiency of controllable generative models by using coarse-grained block-level cache and fine-grained prompt-level cache to reduce computational overhead while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controllable generative models face computational efficiency challenges due to handling both control conditions and content generation requirements, resulting in low generation efficiency.

Method: Uses two-level cache strategy: (1) coarse-grained block-level cache based on feature reuse to bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks, (2) fine-grained prompt-level cache that reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends to adjacent module computations.

Result: On COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, reduces computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T) while keeping semantic fidelity loss within 1.5%. Validated effectiveness on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: HGC approach successfully balances generation efficiency and visual quality by seamlessly integrating different granularity caches into computational links of controllable generation process.

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome key challenges in polyp segmentation: missed small polyps, ambiguous boundaries, and noise from uneven lighting in colonoscopy images.

Method: Proposes coupling gates for noise filtering and feature selection, with three modules: CGMFE for local feature extraction and noise suppression, WCAD decoder for detail restoration, and DFA for progressive feature aggregation.

Result: Outperforms recent networks with mDice scores 2.20% higher on ETIS-LaribPolypDB and 0.68% higher on CVC-ColonDB datasets compared to second-best network.

Conclusion: The proposed MPCGNet with coupling gates and specialized modules effectively addresses polyp segmentation challenges and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation methods of polyps is crucial for assisting doctors in colorectal polyp screening and cancer diagnosis. Despite the progress made by existing methods, polyp segmentation faces several challenges: (1) small-sized polyps are prone to being missed during identification, (2) the boundaries between polyps and the surrounding environment are often ambiguous, (3) noise in colonoscopy images, caused by uneven lighting and other factors, affects segmentation results. To address these challenges, this paper introduces coupling gates as components in specific modules to filter noise and perform feature importance selection. Three modules are proposed: the coupling gates multiscale feature extraction (CGMFE) module, which effectively extracts local features and suppresses noise; the windows cross attention (WCAD) decoder module, which restores details after capturing the precise location of polyps; and the decoder feature aggregation (DFA) module, which progressively aggregates features, further extracts them, and performs feature importance selection to reduce the loss of small-sized polyps. Experimental results demonstrate that MPCGNet outperforms recent networks, with mDice scores 2.20% and 0.68% higher than the second-best network on the ETIS-LaribPolypDB and CVC-ColonDB datasets, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored ability of multimodal LLMs to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type in medical AI.

Method: Reformulated four public medical datasets into unified VQA format using MAT schema, evaluated two multimodal LLMs on Related, Unrelated, and zero-overlap splits.

Result: Models achieved 83.2% classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU on Related splits, but performance dropped significantly in Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions. Cross-task transfer improved segmentation by 7% cIoU.

Conclusion: Multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization, and CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

Conclusion: SemanticNN provides an effective solution for compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy in resource-constrained IoT environments.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.

Method: H²ARN embeds text and 3D data in Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, uses hierarchical ordering loss with entailment cones, instance-level contrastive loss, and contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation with Lorentzian distance weighting.

Result: The method achieves improved text-3D retrieval performance and introduces T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark with 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6x larger than original, covering cultural artefacts and indoor scenes.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic embedding effectively preserves hierarchical structures while contribution-aware aggregation mitigates redundancy, providing a robust solution for text-3D retrieval challenges.

Abstract: With the daily influx of 3D data on the internet, text-3D retrieval has gained increasing attention. However, current methods face two major challenges: Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD). HRC compresses abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies in Euclidean embeddings, while RISD averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues and diminishing the model's ability to distinguish hard negatives. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H$^{2}$ARN) for text-3D retrieval. H$^{2}$ARN embeds both text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, where exponential volume growth inherently preserves hierarchical distances. A hierarchical ordering loss constructs a shrinking entailment cone around each text vector, ensuring that the matched 3D instance falls within the cone, while an instance-level contrastive loss jointly enforces separation from non-matching samples. To tackle RISD, we propose a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that leverages Lorentzian distance to assess the relevance of each local feature and applies contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry, enhancing discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy without additional supervision. We also release the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark, which contains 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6 times the original size, covering both fine-grained cultural artefacts and complex indoor scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PINGS-X is a novel framework for 4D flow MRI super-resolution using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations, achieving faster training and superior accuracy compared to physics-informed neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of cardiovascular conditions, but current methods like PINNs have prohibitively slow training times that must be repeated for each patient.

Method: Extends 3D Gaussian splatting with normalized splatting with convergence guarantees, axes-aligned Gaussians for high-dimensional data, and Gaussian merging for efficiency and preventing degenerate solutions.

Result: Experimental results on CFD and real 4D flow MRI datasets show PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy.

Conclusion: PINGS-X provides an efficient and accurate framework for 4D flow MRI super-resolution, overcoming limitations of previous PINN-based approaches.

Abstract: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy.

*Chuheng Chen,Xiaofei Zhou,Geyuan Zhang,Yong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NP-LoRA is a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that prevents structural interference by enforcing subspace separation through null space projection, improving fusion quality without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA fusion methods suffer from weight-based merging where one LoRA dominates the other, causing interference and degraded fidelity due to non-orthogonal overlapping representations in low-rank subspaces.

Method: Extract principal style directions via SVD, project subject LoRA into orthogonal null space, and use soft projection mechanism for smooth control over subject fidelity vs style consistency trade-off.

Result: NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines across DINO and CLIP-based metrics, with better human and LLM preference scores, working broadly across backbones and LoRA pairs.

Conclusion: The proposed NP-LoRA framework effectively prevents structural interference in LoRA fusion through subspace separation, enabling high-quality controllable generation without retraining.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fusion has emerged as a key technique for reusing and composing learned subject and style representations for controllable generation without costly retraining. However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions. Specifically, we first extract principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and then project the subject LoRA into its orthogonal null space. Furthermore, we introduce a soft projection mechanism that enables smooth control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style consistency. Experiments show NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines (e.g., DINO and CLIP-based metrics, with human and LLM preference scores), and applies broadly across backbones and LoRA pairs without retraining.

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-reference generative image composition model with feature calibration to improve detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative image composition methods struggle with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment.

Method: Extends generative composition to multi-reference version and calibrates global/local features of foreground references to make them compatible with background information.

Result: Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom show generative models greatly benefit from calibrated reference features.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-reference approach with feature calibration effectively addresses detail preservation and pose/view adjustment in image composition.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

*Dor Shmilovich,Tony Wu,Aviad Dahan,Yuval Domb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteAttention accelerates video diffusion transformers by exploiting temporal coherence in attention sparsity patterns across denoising steps, eliminating redundant computations without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers for video generation suffer from quadratic attention complexity causing prohibitive latency, while existing acceleration methods face trade-offs between dynamic pattern overhead and static pattern suboptimality.

Method: LiteAttention identifies temporal coherence in attention sparsity patterns and uses evolutionary computation skips by marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward across denoising steps.

Result: Substantial speedups achieved on production video diffusion models with no degradation in quality, implemented as optimized kernel on top of FlashAttention.

Conclusion: LiteAttention combines adaptivity of dynamic methods with efficiency of static ones by exploiting temporal coherence, providing significant acceleration for video diffusion transformers.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

*Jiechao Gao,Chang Liu,Yuangang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S2D-Align is a novel SFT paradigm for radiology report generation that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment using auxiliary signals of varying granularities through a shallow-to-deep strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SFT paradigms fail to establish anatomically-grounded alignment in radiology report generation due to the templated nature of reports, leading to sub-optimal generation quality.

Method: S2D-Align implements a shallow-to-deep strategy: starts with coarse radiograph-report pairing, introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and uses key phrases to ground generation in anatomical details. Uses a memory-based adapter for feature sharing between alignment stages.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray benchmarks. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach.

Conclusion: S2D-Align presents a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks by establishing anatomically-grounded alignment through progressive enrichment with auxiliary signals.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

TL;DR: Comparison of diffusion models and autoregressive transformers for 3D shape generation and completion, showing diffusion models excel with continuous latents while autoregressive models match performance in discrete latent spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's no consensus on which generative models work best for 3D data tasks, and conditional information like partial 3D data hasn't been thoroughly evaluated compared to text/image conditioning.

Method: Adapted Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers for generative shape modeling and completion tasks, with thorough quantitative evaluation including baseline discriminative model and extensive ablation study.

Result: Diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms discriminative and autoregressive approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from single noisy depth images. Autoregressive models match or exceed diffusion performance when using the same discrete latent space.

Conclusion: Both diffusion and autoregressive models are effective for 3D shape tasks, with performance dependent on the latent space representation - continuous latents favor diffusion models while discrete latents enable competitive autoregressive performance.

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

Motivation: Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data for realistic liquid behaviors under dynamic scenarios, which is crucial for autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks.

Method: Created Phys-Liquid dataset with simulation images and 3D meshes across multiple scenarios, and proposed a four-stage pipeline involving segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The dataset and validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks for robotic applications.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical weather prediction models are computationally demanding and perform poorly at nowcasting timescales (0-4 hours), while AI-based weather prediction alternatives using video understanding architectures remain underexplored.

Method: Proposed SaTformer - a video transformer with full space-time attention that reformulates precipitation regression as a classification problem and uses class-weighted loss to handle imbalanced datasets.

Result: The model achieved first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge.

Conclusion: Video transformers with space-time attention are effective for extreme precipitation forecasting, and reformulating regression as classification with weighted loss helps address dataset imbalances.

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT-based Agatston scoring is the gold standard for CAC detection but is costly for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays lack reliable ground truth labels, limiting deep learning development.

Method: Generate synthetic DRRs from 667 CT scans, evaluate model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing strategies, and curriculum learning with lightweight CNNs trained from scratch.

Result: Best configuration achieves mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies, with lightweight CNNs outperforming large pretrained networks.

Conclusion: DRRs establish a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection and provide groundwork for future transfer learning to real CXRs.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, with CT-based Agatston scoring widely regarded as the clinical gold standard. However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. These results establish DRRs as a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection, while laying the foundation for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.

Conclusion: PRISMA hyperspectral data combined with few-shot learning provides effective solution for detecting bark beetle infestations in forests.

Abstract: Bark beetle infestations represent a serious challenge for maintaining the health of coniferous forests. This paper proposes a few-shot learning approach leveraging contrastive learning to detect bark beetle infestations using satellite PRISMA hyperspectral data. The methodology is based on a contrastive learning framework to pre-train a one-dimensional CNN encoder, enabling the extraction of robust feature representations from hyperspectral data. These extracted features are subsequently utilized as input to support vector regression estimators, one for each class, trained on few labeled samples to estimate the proportions of healthy, attacked by bark beetle, and dead trees for each pixel. Experiments on the area of study in the Dolomites show that our method outperforms the use of original PRISMA spectral bands and of Sentinel-2 data. The results indicate that PRISMA hyperspectral data combined with few-shot learning offers significant advantages for forest health monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending reinforcement fine-tuning from text to video language models is challenging, and existing approaches don't properly model the distinct processes of perception and reasoning in video understanding.

Method: Two-stage framework: SFT stage creates VideoP2R-CoT-162K dataset with process-aware chain-of-thought; RL stage uses novel PA-GRPO algorithm with separate rewards for perception and reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 6 out of 7 video reasoning and understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: Process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO are effective, and perception output provides sufficient information for downstream reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI-generated media (GANs, diffusion models) has made it difficult to distinguish real from synthetic content, leading to misuse for misinformation, privacy violations, and fraud. Current detection methods struggle with generalization across different models and data types.

Method: The study conducts a comprehensive review of 24 recent works on AI-generated media detection, examining each study individually to identify contributions and weaknesses, then summarizing common limitations and key challenges.

Result: The review found that current detection approaches using CNNs and ViTs often fail to generalize across unseen data, struggle with content from different models, and are ineffective for multimodal data and highly modified content.

Conclusion: Multimodal deep learning models are suggested as a promising research direction to provide more robust and generalized detection capabilities, offering future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

Conclusion: LVGM successfully bridges LLM capabilities with vector glyph generation, enabling scalable and flexible Chinese character synthesis through stroke sequence prediction.

Abstract: Vectorized glyphs are widely used in poster design, network animation, art display, and various other fields due to their scalability and flexibility. In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation.

*Yu Zhao,Ying Zhang,Xuhui Sui,Baohang Zhou,Li Shen,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HinD framework with KEPO elicits explicit multi-step reasoning in MLLMs for KBVQA by using hindsight distillation and knowledge preference optimization, achieving superior performance without external APIs or knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KBVQA methods lack explicit multi-step reasoning trajectories from MLLMs, relying on implicit knowledge via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval, which limits reasoning transparency and effectiveness.

Method: 1) Hindsight distillation: Use frozen 7B MLLM to generate reasoning between questions and answers, creating Hindsight-Zero data. 2) Self-distill into CoT Generator and Knowledge Generator. 3) KEPO optimization: Prefer under-confident but helpful knowledge over over-confident unhelpful knowledge.

Result: Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA show HinD achieves superior performance using only 7B-size MLLM without commercial APIs or external knowledge.

Conclusion: HinD framework successfully elicits and harnesses internal knowledge reasoning in MLLMs through hindsight distillation and knowledge preference optimization, providing explicit multi-step reasoning for KBVQA.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

*Zhanpeng Wang,Shuting Cao,Yuhang Lu,Yuhan Li,Na Lei,Zhongxuan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OT-ALD is a novel image-to-image translation framework that uses optimal transport theory to address efficiency and quality issues in DDIB-based methods by aligning latent distributions between source and target domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the low translation efficiency and trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions in DDIB-based image-to-image translation methods.

Method: Compute an optimal transport map from source to target domain latent distributions, then use the mapped distribution as starting point for reverse diffusion in target domain.

Result: Improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces FID score by 2.6 on average across four translation tasks on three high-resolution datasets compared to top-performing baselines.

Conclusion: OT-ALD effectively balances faster translation with improved quality by eliminating latent distribution mismatches through optimal transport theory.

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

### [59] [Reverberation: Learning the Latencies Before Forecasting Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11164)
*Conghao Wong,Ziqian Zou,Beihao Xia,Xinge You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a reverberation-based trajectory prediction model that explicitly learns and predicts agent latencies in responding to trajectory-changing events, enabling controllable and interpretable forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current trajectory prediction methods lack explicit modeling of agent latencies - the temporal delays in how agents respond to events. This oversight can undermine causal continuity and lead to implausible trajectories.

Method: Introduces a reverberation transform inspired by acoustics, using two explicit learnable reverberation kernels to simulate and predict different latency preferences of each agent and their stochasticity.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy on multiple datasets (pedestrians and vehicles) while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios.

Conclusion: The reverberation transform provides a general latency modeling approach that enables controllable trajectory prediction and offers interpretable insights into agent behavior.

Abstract: Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.

*Alex George,Lyudmila Mihaylova,Sean Anderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiTypeFCDD is a lightweight convolutional framework for explainable multi-type anomaly detection that uses image-level labels to generate multi-channel heatmaps, with each channel corresponding to a specific anomaly type, achieving competitive results with significantly reduced computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explainable anomaly detection methods lack the ability to differentiate anomaly types (e.g., 'Crack' vs. 'Scratch') and require separate models for each object category, which is costly to train and maintain. Existing VLMs are computationally intensive and unsuitable for real-time or embedded systems.

Method: Proposed MultiTypeFCDD uses a simple convolutional framework with image-level labels to learn multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to detect a specific anomaly type. It functions as a single unified framework for multiple object categories.

Result: Evaluation on Real-IAD dataset shows competitive performance with state-of-the-art complex models while significantly reducing parametric load and inference times.

Conclusion: MultiTypeFCDD provides a practical and viable solution for real-world applications with constrained computational resources, offering explainable multi-type anomaly detection without the need for separate models per object category.

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

TL;DR: CATS-V2V is the first real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception in complex adverse traffic scenarios, featuring 100 clips with LiDAR, camera, and GNSS/IMU data across diverse weather and lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets focus on ordinary traffic scenarios, limiting cooperative perception benefits. Complex adverse scenarios are under-represented despite their importance for robust autonomous driving.

Method: Collected using two time-synchronized vehicles across 10 weather/lighting conditions and 10 locations. Provides LiDAR point clouds, multi-view camera images, and RTK-fixed GNSS/IMU data with 3D bounding box annotations and static scene data for 4D BEV representation.

Result: Created a 100-clip dataset with 60K LiDAR frames, 1.26M camera images, and 750K GNSS/IMU records. Implemented target-based temporal alignment for precise cross-modal object alignment.

Conclusion: CATS-V2V is the largest, most comprehensive dataset for V2V cooperative perception in adverse conditions, expected to significantly benefit autonomous driving research and development.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

*Ayush Pandey,Jai Bardhan,Ishita Jain,Ramya S Hebbalaguppe,Rohan Raju Dhanakshirur,Lovekesh Vig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignVQA is a debate-based multi-agent framework that improves confidence calibration in Visual Question Answering systems by having specialized VLMs generate answers and engage in critique and refinement processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern VQA systems using vision-language models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes applications but often produce overconfident responses with unreliable confidence estimates, which is problematic for autonomous decision-making under uncertainty.

Method: A multi-agent framework where specialized VLMs with distinct prompting strategies generate candidate answers, followed by two-stage interaction where generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate proposals. Also introduces a differentiable calibration-aware loss function (aligncal) to fine-tune agents by minimizing calibration error upper bounds.

Result: Empirical results across multiple VQA benchmarks show substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies, with more calibrated specialized agents producing better aligned confidences.

Conclusion: The debate-based multi-agent approach combined with calibration-aware fine-tuning effectively improves confidence calibration in VQA systems, making confidence estimates more accurately reflect true predictive performance.

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

*Zhixin Xu,Hengyu Zhou,Yuan Liu,Wenhan Xue,Hao Pan,Wenping Wang,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A temporal alignment strategy for 4D Gaussian Splatting that handles unsynchronized multi-view videos through coarse-to-fine time shift estimation and compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-view videos often suffer from temporal misalignment due to camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, which degrades reconstruction quality in 4DGS methods that assume synchronized inputs.

Method: Coarse-to-fine alignment module that first estimates frame-level time offsets and then refines them to sub-frame accuracy, designed as a plug-and-play component for existing 4DGS frameworks.

Result: The method effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: The proposed temporal alignment strategy improves the robustness of 4DGS for handling asynchronous multi-view video data in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

TL;DR: Viper-F1 is an efficient multimodal language model that replaces attention with state-space dynamics for linear-time inference while improving fine-grained visual grounding through token-grid correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational cost of Transformer-based MLLMs and their poor performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks in resource-constrained scenarios like robotics and smart devices.

Method: Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model using Liquid State-Space Dynamics instead of attention, with Token-Grid Correlation Module for computing lightweight text-image correlations and modulating state-space via FiLM conditioning.

Result: Achieves accurate fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency across multiple benchmarks, maintaining linear-time inference while selectively emphasizing relevant visual regions.

Conclusion: Viper-F1 demonstrates that efficient state-space models can replace attention mechanisms in MLLMs while enhancing visual grounding capabilities for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

The proposed approach leverages analysis fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution. A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context. Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data.

Motivation: To develop an effective short-term rainfall prediction system for weather forecasting competitions, leveraging transfer learning and spatiotemporal pattern recognition.

Method: Two-stage training: first stage trains ConvGRU to forecast SEVIRI brightness temperatures, second stage applies nonlinear transformation to convert predictions to rainfall rates, with 3D event detection for precipitation event characterization.

Result: Achieved 2nd place in cumulative rainfall task, and comparable performance to baseline in event prediction task using the same model.

Conclusion: The transfer learning approach with ConvGRU effectively captures spatiotemporal patterns for rainfall prediction and can be adapted for different forecasting tasks with good performance.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Motivation: High-fidelity gaze redirection is needed to generate augmented data for improving gaze estimator generalization, addressing limitations of current 3D Gaussian Splatting models in rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts.

Method: Combines Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for higher-fidelity synthesis, weak supervision using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles for smooth gaze manifolds, and orthogonality constraint loss to disentangle gaze, head pose, and expression representations.

Conclusion: DiT-Gaze offers a superior framework for gaze redirection that advances the state-of-the-art and will be made available to the research community for benchmarking.

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs are highly sensitive to minor visual/textual perturbations that preserve meaning, with even state-of-the-art models failing on small pixel shifts or rephrasings. Stability patterns can predict model correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate VLM robustness to benign perturbations that don't alter semantics, as current understanding of their reliability under minor input changes is limited.

Method: Large-scale study across multiple models and datasets using pixel-level shifts, geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites.

Result: Modern VLMs are highly unstable - substantial fraction of samples change predictions under minor perturbations. Stable samples are far more likely to be correct. Small open-source models' stability patterns can predict larger closed-source models' correctness.

Conclusion: Current VLMs exhibit fundamental fragility to benign perturbations, highlighting the need for robustness evaluations focusing on semantic invariances rather than just adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Conclusion: Establishes crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

Motivation: Address the challenge of data scarcity in medical imaging by enabling a single foundation model to expand across domains, tasks, and modalities instead of building separate models for each.

Method: Uses lightweight modular components as specialized skill sets that can be flexibly activated during inference based on input type or clinical objective, providing a unified framework for multitask and multimodality adaptation.

Result: Improved performance on both prognosis and segmentation tasks, with PET scan incorporation achieving 5% Dice score improvement compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Foundation models with modular components can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging, overcoming initial training scope constraints.

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

TL;DR: New AI framework for detecting gaze targets in autistic children using social context to overcome class imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children, especially for those with limited access to professionals, to measure joint attention - a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Method: Proposes Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) framework with two-pathway architecture using expert models for social and non-social gaze, guided by context-awareness gate module. Uses first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses class imbalance in autism datasets and provides effective gaze target detection for autistic children, advancing automated joint attention measurement systems.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

*Ruocheng Wu,Haolan He,Yufei Wang,Zhihao Li,Bihan Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSD framework uses Video Diffusion Models to provide multi-view consistency guidance for 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing overfitting in sparse view scenarios through depth warp and semantic feature guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting suffers from overfitting when trained with sparse views due to lack of intermediate-view supervision, requiring external priors for multi-view consistency.

Method: Proposes Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) that extracts multi-view consistency priors from pretrained Video Diffusion Models, using depth warp guidance and semantic feature guidance to correct noise prediction and ensure proper camera pose alignment.

Result: Experimental results show the method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets, demonstrating improved performance in sparse view scenarios.

Conclusion: GSD effectively leverages Video Diffusion Models to provide multi-view consistency supervision for 3D Gaussian Splatting, overcoming overfitting issues in sparse training view scenarios through unified guidance correction.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

### [74] [D-GAP: Improving Out-of-Domain Robustness via Dataset-Agnostic and Gradient-Guided Augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11286)
*Ruoqi Wang,Haitao Wang,Shaojie Guo,Qiong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-GAP improves out-of-domain robustness by combining frequency-space and pixel-space augmentations guided by task gradients, outperforming existing methods on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks struggle with domain shifts due to learning bias towards domain-specific frequency components, and existing frequency-based methods overlook pixel-level details.

Method: Computes sensitivity maps from task gradients to guide adaptive amplitude interpolation in frequency space, complemented by pixel-space blending to restore spatial details.

Result: Improves average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming both generic and dataset-specific augmentations.

Conclusion: D-GAP effectively addresses domain shift challenges through targeted frequency and pixel-space augmentations guided by model sensitivity, achieving superior OOD robustness.

Abstract: Out-of-domain (OOD) robustness is challenging to achieve in real-world computer vision applications, where shifts in image background, style, and acquisition instruments always degrade model performance. Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks show that D-GAP consistently outperforms both generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets.

*Kebin Wu,Fatima Albreiki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Investigates positional bias in multimodal representation models for image-text retrieval, finding bias manifests differently in text (beginning-focused) vs image (beginning and end-focused) encoders due to multiple factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Positional bias negatively impacts model performance but has been underexplored in representation models and multimodal contexts, particularly in image-text retrieval tasks.

Method: Distinguishes between context importance and positional bias, then assesses positional bias across different models and datasets in multimodal image-text retrieval settings.

Result: Positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models - text encoders bias toward input beginning, while image encoders show bias at both beginning and end. Bias arises from positional encoding, training loss, context importance, and multimodal training nature.

Conclusion: Positional bias exists in multimodal representation models with modality-specific patterns, influenced by multiple architectural and training factors that need consideration in model design.

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

*Haokun Chen,Jianing Li,Yao Zhang,Jinhe Bi,Yan Xia,Jindong Gu,Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AUVIC is a novel framework for visual concept unlearning in MLLMs that uses adversarial perturbations to precisely remove target concepts while preserving performance on related entities, achieving state-of-the-art forgetting rates with minimal performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs trained on massive datasets raise data privacy concerns due to sensitive/copyrighted content, and regulatory requirements for 'right to be forgotten' necessitate machine unlearning capabilities, especially for visual concepts which remain underexplored.

Method: AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise visual concept forgetting, effectively isolating target concepts while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. The framework is evaluated using VCUBench, the first benchmark for visual concept unlearning in group contexts.

Result: Experimental results show AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurring minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

Conclusion: AUVIC successfully addresses the challenge of precise visual concept unlearning in MLLMs, providing an effective solution for data privacy compliance without requiring resource-intensive retraining.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

*Mingwei Xing,Xinliang Wang,Yifeng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoReMi is a Mixture-of-Experts framework that jointly models domain-aware experts and unified representations to address multi-domain point cloud heterogeneity, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D understanding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D deep learning generalization is limited by dataset scale and multi-source point cloud heterogeneity, where different sensors (LiDAR vs mesh-derived) create domain discrepancies causing negative transfer in multi-domain fusion.

Method: Proposes DoReMi with Domain-aware Experts branch and unified Representation branch using Domain-Guided Spatial Routing for expert selection and Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation for stable expert utilization, plus frozen unified branch pretrained via multi-attribute self-supervised learning.

Result: Achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: DoReMi shows strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research by enabling cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge while preserving cross-domain geometric priors.

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

*Maria-Teresa De Rosa Palmini,Eva Cetinic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to distinguish between recognition and realization of cultural references in text-to-image diffusion models, showing that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered, and that cultural alignment depends on multiple factors beyond training data frequency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, specifically focusing on multimodal iconicity where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations like familiar artworks or film scenes.

Method: Developed an evaluation framework separating recognition (identifying references) from realization (depiction through replication or reinterpretation), evaluated five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references, and conducted prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions.

Result: The framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. Models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Cultural alignment correlates with training data frequency, textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date.

Conclusion: The value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

*Cong Cao,Yujie Xu,Xiaodong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a few-shot style editing framework with MoE LoRA for efficient multi-style fine-tuning using limited paired data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General image editing models fail with new styles, and fine-tuning with limited data is challenging.

Method: Uses Mixture-of-Experts LoRA with style-specific/shared routing, metric-guided rank selection, and integrates adversarial learning and flow matching in DiT model.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively adapts general models to new styles with limited data through efficient parameter usage.

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

TL;DR: GEODE is a novel VLM architecture that addresses 3D spatial reasoning limitations by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation using specialized plug-and-play modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with real-world 3D spatial intelligence due to input-stage conflicts between geometric-aware encoders and 2D features, and output-stage misalignment where tokenizers can't produce precise continuous values.

Method: Introduces two modules: DRM (spatial co-processor that aligns 3D data with 2D features via cross-attention and distills spatial Chain-of-Thought logic) and DRH (Direct Regression Head using Embedding-as-Value paradigm for precise continuous regression).

Result: The 1.5B parameter model achieves state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance rivaling 7B+ models, functioning as a high-level semantic dispatcher.

Conclusion: GEODE successfully breaks the dual-bottleneck in VLMs for 3D spatial reasoning through its decoupled architecture approach.

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

*Jitesh Chavan,Rohit Lal,Anand Kamat,Mengjia Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Arcee introduces a cross-block recurrent state chain that reuses terminal state-space representations between blocks in Mamba models, improving performance for vision tasks without adding parameters or significant computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mamba models for vision tasks reinitialize state-space dynamics from zero for each block, discarding valuable terminal state representations from previous blocks, which limits their modeling capacity.

Method: Arcee creates a differentiable boundary map that passes each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block, enabling end-to-end gradient flow across blocks while maintaining compatibility with existing vision-mamba variants.

Result: On CelebA-HQ (256×256) with Flow Matching, Arcee reduces FID from 82.81 to 15.33 (5.4× improvement) on a Zigzag Mamba baseline, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Conclusion: Reusing terminal state-space representations across blocks via Arcee provides substantial performance improvements for vision tasks using Mamba models, with the approach being parameter-free, computationally efficient, and compatible with existing variants.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), Mamba in particular, are increasingly adopted for long-context sequence modeling, providing linear-time aggregation via an input-dependent, causal selective-scan operation. Along this line, recent "Mamba-for-vision" variants largely explore multiple scan orders to relax strict causality for non-sequential signals (e.g., images). Rather than preserving cross-block memory, the conventional formulation of the selective-scan operation in Mamba reinitializes each block's state-space dynamics from zero, discarding the terminal state-space representation (SSR) from the previous block. Arcee, a cross-block recurrent state chain, reuses each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block. Handoff across blocks is constructed as a differentiable boundary map whose Jacobian enables end-to-end gradient flow across terminal boundaries. Key to practicality, Arcee is compatible with all prior "vision-mamba" variants, parameter-free, and incurs constant, negligible cost. As a modeling perspective, we view terminal SSR as a mild directional prior induced by a causal pass over the input, rather than an estimator of the non-sequential signal itself. To quantify the impact, for unconditional generation on CelebA-HQ (256$\times$256) with Flow Matching, Arcee reduces FID$\downarrow$ from $82.81$ to $15.33$ ($5.4\times$ lower) on a single scan-order Zigzag Mamba baseline. Efficient CUDA kernels and training code will be released to support rigorous and reproducible research.

TL;DR: VRD-UQA benchmark evaluates VLLMs' ability to detect plausible yet unanswerable questions in visually rich documents through automatic corruption of existing VQA datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLLMs excel at VQA on multi-page VRDs but their robustness to plausible unanswerable questions remains unexplored, especially questions that appear valid but cannot be answered due to subtle corruptions.

Method: Created VRD-UQA benchmark by automatically altering questions in existing VQA datasets through entity swaps, document element changes, and layout modifications, then using VLLM-as-a-judge to verify unanswerability and evaluate 12 models across multiple dimensions.

Result: Experiments reveal VLLMs' limitations in detecting unanswerable questions and show the effects of different corruption types and knowledge injection strategies on performance.

Conclusion: VRD-UQA serves as an effective evaluation framework for developing resilient document VQA systems by exposing VLLMs' vulnerabilities to plausible unanswerable questions.

Abstract: The evolution of Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) has revolutionized the automatic understanding of Visually Rich Documents (VRDs), which contain both textual and visual elements. Although VLLMs excel in Visual Question Answering (VQA) on multi-page VRDs, their ability to detect unanswerable questions is still an open research question. Our research delves into the robustness of the VLLMs to plausible yet unanswerable questions, i.e., questions that appear valid but cannot be answered due to subtle corruptions caused by swaps between related concepts or plausible question formulations. Corruptions are generated by replacing the original natural language entities with other ones of the same type, belonging to different document elements, and in different layout positions or pages of the related document. To this end, we present VRD-UQA (VISUALLY RICH DOCUMENT UNANSWERABLE QUESTION ANSWERING), a benchmark for evaluating VLLMs' resilience to plausible yet unanswerable questions across multiple dimensions. It automatically alters the questions of existing VQA datasets consisting of multi-page VRDs, verifies their unanswerability using a VLLM-as-a-judge approach, and then thoroughly evaluates VLLMs' performance. Experiments, run on 12 models, analyze: (1) The VLLMs' accuracy in detecting unanswerable questions at both page and document levels; (2) The effect of different types of corruption (NLP entity, document element, layout); (3) The effectiveness of different knowledge injection strategies based on in-context learning (OCR, multi-page selection, or the possibility of unanswerability). Our findings reveal VLLMs' limitations and demonstrate that VRD-UQA can serve as an evaluation framework for developing resilient document VQA systems.

TL;DR: ImAgent is a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation in a single framework to address randomness and inconsistency in text-to-image generation, enabling efficient test-time scaling without external models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models suffer from randomness and inconsistency with vague prompts, and existing solutions like prompt rewriting and self-refinement require additional modules, hindering test-time efficiency and increasing computational overhead.

Method: ImAgent uses a policy controller to guide multiple generation actions that dynamically interact and self-organize, integrating reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single training-free framework.

Result: Extensive experiments show ImAgent consistently improves over backbone models and surpasses other baselines where the backbone fails, enhancing image fidelity and semantic alignment.

Conclusion: ImAgent demonstrates the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling, achieving better performance without relying on external models.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating visually realistic and semantically coherent images. However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountSteer is a training-free method that improves text-to-image models' ability to follow numerical instructions by steering cross-attention hidden states during inference, leveraging the model's latent awareness of numerical correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation, despite the models being implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy.

Method: CountSteer steers the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference based on the observation that internal signals shift consistently depending on whether the output meets specified object counts.

Result: CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality in experiments.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation by harnessing the model's latent notion of numerical correctness.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

TL;DR: Proposes a vision-language model that groups caption tokens to capture fine-grained language representations, aligning them with object-level image features for better understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models align image patches with individual tokens, but patches lack human meaning and tokens don't necessarily carry groundable image information. Groups of tokens better describe scene aspects.

Method: Developed a model that groups caption tokens as part of its architecture to create fine-grained language representations, aligning these with outputs from an image encoder trained for object discovery.

Result: The model achieves better fine-grained understanding of vision and language through token grouping. Discovered token groups are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: Learning to group tokens enables vision-language models to develop more meaningful fine-grained representations that align better with object-level visual understanding.

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

### [86] [PAS : Prelim Attention Score for Detecting Object Hallucinations in Large Vision--Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11502)
*Nhat Hoang-Xuan,Minh Vu,My T. Thai,Manish Bhattarai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLMs often hallucinate objects by ignoring images and relying on previously generated tokens. The paper introduces PAS, a training-free attention-based score that detects hallucinations by measuring image dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models suffer from object hallucinations where they generate objects not present in images, making them unreliable for real-world applications.

Method: Proposed Prelim Attention Score (PAS) - a lightweight signal computed from attention weights over previously generated tokens during inference, requiring no additional forward passes.

Result: PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

Conclusion: The attention patterns over previously generated tokens provide a reliable signal for detecting hallucinations, offering a practical solution for improving LVLM reliability.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context using traffic scene graphs, improving driving performance without requiring scene graphs at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models for autonomous driving lack explicit supervision for relational dependencies between traffic entities, limiting their ability to reason about spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input.

Method: Proposes serializing traffic scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, incorporating them into models via structured prompt templates to provide relational supervision during training.

Result: Extensive evaluations on LangAuto benchmark show significant improvements: 15.6% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5% for BEVDriver, with persistent performance gains.

Conclusion: Scene graph conditioning enables models to better internalize and ground relational priors, demonstrating that structured relational supervision during training enhances driving performance even without scene graph input at test time.

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time.

TL;DR: Φeat is a self-supervised visual backbone that learns physically-grounded representations sensitive to material identity by contrasting spatial crops and physical augmentations under varying shapes and lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors like geometry and illumination, limiting their effectiveness in tasks requiring explicit physical reasoning.

Method: Uses a pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions, without explicit supervision.

Result: Learned representations capture physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping, showing strong performance in material selection and feature similarity analysis.

Conclusion: Unsupervised physical feature learning shows promise as a foundation for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as effective backbones for many vision tasks. However, current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors, such as geometry and illumination, hindering their use in tasks requiring explicit physical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce $Φ$eat, a novel physically-grounded visual backbone that encourages a representation sensitive to material identity, including reflectance cues and geometric mesostructure. Our key idea is to employ a pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions. While similar data have been used in high-end supervised tasks such as intrinsic decomposition or material estimation, we demonstrate that a pure self-supervised training strategy, without explicit labels, already provides a strong prior for tasks requiring robust features invariant to external physical factors. We evaluate the learned representations through feature similarity analysis and material selection, showing that $Φ$eat captures physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping. These findings highlight the promise of unsupervised physical feature learning as a foundation for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics.

*Haoyi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORAL is a method that captures local and global anatomical structure in volumetric medical images through contrastive ranking and ordinal objectives, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation performance with limited annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use hard binary thresholds that discard continuous anatomical similarity information and overlook global directional consistency, leading to distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold across patients.

Method: CORAL uses a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity and an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning feature distribution with canonical anatomical progression.

Result: CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

Conclusion: Learning inter-slice relationships through coordinative learning produces anatomically informed representations that benefit downstream segmentation tasks in volumetric medical imaging.

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

Conclusion: SimuFreeMark provides a more robust and generalizable watermarking solution by leveraging the natural stability of low-frequency image components, eliminating the need for noise simulation and achieving better performance across diverse attack scenarios.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions.

We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in automated fruit harvesting due to high costs and labor shortages in advanced economies, particularly focusing on the lack of available training data for pose estimation algorithms.

Method: Uses YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm with synthetic data generated from 3D strawberry models via a procedural Blender pipeline to enhance realism for training pose estimation models.

Result: Models achieve comparable accuracy on NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across ADD-S metrics, with RTX 3090 showing superior speed but Jetson Orin Nano being suitable for resource-constrained agricultural robotics deployment.

Conclusion: The approach successfully estimates poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, though struggles with unripe specimens. The methodology is easily adaptable to other fruits like apples, peaches, and plums, expanding its applicability in agricultural automation.

Abstract: Automated and selective harvesting of fruits has become an important area of research, particularly due to challenges such as high costs and a shortage of seasonal labor in advanced economies. This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics.

*Lan Li,Tao Hu,Da-Wei Zhou,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOFA is a novel CIL framework that adapts CLIP models by exclusively using the existing cross-modal bridge-layer, adding no extra parameters. It prevents forgetting through Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion and uses cross-modal hybrid prototypes for enhanced classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying CLIP to CIL faces challenges: (1) additional learnable modules increase complexity and forgetting risk, (2) existing methods don't fully exploit multi-modal representations' potential for effective visual-textual integration.

Method: BOFA confines all adaptation to CLIP's cross-modal bridge-layer using Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion to constrain updates to a low-rank safe subspace orthogonal to past tasks. Uses cross-modal hybrid prototypes combining stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts.

Result: Extensive experiments show BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: BOFA effectively addresses CIL challenges with CLIP by leveraging existing bridge-layer without extra parameters, preventing forgetting through orthogonal constraints, and enhancing performance via cross-modal hybrid prototypes.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The dataset provides structured event data with optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking in event-based computer vision.

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D motion generation models rely on precise 3D supervision, which limits generalization beyond training distributions by encouraging coordinate pattern fitting rather than learning essential 3D structure and motion semantics.

Method: Proposes Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) to map 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, with 3D-free regularization objectives for view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility.

Result: Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts when trained entirely on 2D motion data.

Conclusion: Relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation methods for material analysis either lack accuracy/speed (traditional methods) or require large labeled datasets (supervised CNNs), while unsupervised approaches suffer from slow segmentation and poor accuracy.

Method: Integration of HMRF theory with CNN segmentation, incorporating neighborhood and class distribution concepts through unsupervised HMRF loss, and proposing a pre-training strategy to reduce ground-truth data requirements.

Result: HMRF-UNet achieves high segmentation accuracy on Micro-CT images of Polyurethane foam structures without ground truth, and the pre-training strategy significantly reduces required labeled data.

Conclusion: The hybrid HMRF-UNet approach successfully leverages unsupervised learning with fast segmentation, providing an effective solution for material image analysis with minimal ground-truth dependency.

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between analog and digital chess experiences by providing real-time analysis assistance for physical chess games, similar to what exists for online chess platforms.

Method: Uses CNN with residual layers for piece recognition from smartphone images, involving Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform for board alignment, segmentation into 64 squares, and classification into 13 piece classes.

Result: Trained and evaluated on Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD) with 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse conditions, achieving accurate FEN string generation for chess engine input.

Conclusion: The system successfully enables physical chess analysis by converting board images to FEN notation, allowing integration with online chess engines to suggest optimal moves.

Abstract: Chess has experienced a large increase in viewership since the pandemic, driven largely by the accessibility of online learning platforms. However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles. The resulting classifications are encoded as an FEN string, which can be fed into a chess engine to generate the most optimal move

*Feng-Qi Cui,Jinyang Huang,Ziyu Jia,Xinyu Li,Xin Yan,Xiaokang Zhou,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LSEF framework using low-rank sparse principle to hierarchically model emotional bases and transient fluctuations in video-based affective computing, improving robustness and dynamic discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address model instability and representational degradation in video-based affective computing caused by complex emotional dynamics and lack of hierarchical structural mechanisms to disentangle distinct affective components.

Method: LSEF framework with three modules: Stability Encoding Module (SEM) for low-rank emotional bases, Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) for sparse transient signals, and Consistency Integration Module (CIM) for multi-scale coherence reconstruction, optimized by Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination in affective computing tasks.

Conclusion: Validates effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics in video-based emotion analysis.

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

*Manyu Li,Ruian He,Chenxi Ma,Weimin Tan,Bo Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MicroVQA++ is a high-quality microscopy VQA dataset created using a three-stage process involving expert-validated data, graph-based filtering (HiCQA-Graph), and MLLM-generated questions with human screening, enabling competitive performance with small models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data for scientific reasoning in microscopy, which limits the application of Multimodal Large Language Models in biomedical imaging.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Bootstrap supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs; 2) Apply HiCQA-Graph (heterogeneous graph fusing NLI-based entailment, CLIP-based alignment, and agent signals) to filter inconsistent samples; 3) Use MLLM agent to generate multiple-choice questions followed by human screening.

Result: Created a large training split and human-checked test split with Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeding MicroVQA benchmark. Enabled 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance comparable to GPT-5 and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs.

Conclusion: Careful data construction with expert literature coupling, graph-based filtering, and human refinement enables small MLLMs to achieve competitive microscopy reasoning, demonstrating the importance of quality-controlled dataset creation for scientific domains.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.

*Jiaxi Huang,Dongxu Wu,Hanwei Zhu,Lingyu Zhu,Jun Xing,Xu Wang,Baoliang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Doc is a three-tiered framework for evaluating Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) capabilities in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), revealing their nascent abilities but critical limitations in quality scoring, distortion identification, and severity assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential of MLLMs for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored despite their advancement in multi-modal capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks.

Method: A three-tiered evaluation framework: coarse level (quality scoring), middle level (distortion-type identification via single/multi-choice tests), and fine level (distortion-severity assessment against human references).

Result: MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities but exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels.

Conclusion: The work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement through techniques like CoT prompting.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement.

### [103] [Shrinking the Teacher: An Adaptive Teaching Paradigm for Asymmetric EEG-Vision Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11422)
*Lukun Wu,Jie Li,Ziqi Ren,Kaifan Zhang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive teaching paradigm for asymmetric EEG-vision alignment using ShrinkAdapter module, achieving 60.2% top-1 accuracy in brain-to-image retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fundamental asymmetry between EEG and vision modalities with Fidelity Gap (EEG noise vs vision clarity) and Semantic Gap (EEG shallow concepts vs vision rich semantics), overcoming limitations of previous equal-partner alignment approaches.

Method: Adaptive teaching paradigm where vision (teacher) dynamically shrinks knowledge structure to match EEG (student) capacity, implemented via ShrinkAdapter module with residual-free design and bottleneck structure.

Result: Achieves 60.2% top-1 accuracy on zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval, surpassing previous state-of-the-art by 9.8% margin.

Conclusion: Teacher modality must shrink and adapt to bridge vision-brain gap, introducing new perspective for asymmetric alignment in cross-modal learning.

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

### [104] [Comprehension of Multilingual Expressions Referring to Target Objects in Visual Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11427)
*Francisco Nogueira,Alexandre Bernardino,Bruno Martins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multilingual dataset and attention-anchored architecture for Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) across 10 languages, achieving competitive performance while addressing the English-centric bias in visual grounding research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the English-centric nature of REC research and meet global deployment demands by enabling multilingual visual grounding capabilities.

Method: Created a unified multilingual dataset by expanding 12 English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based enhancement, and developed an attention-anchored neural architecture using multilingual SigLIP2 encoders with coarse spatial anchors refined through learned residuals.

Result: Achieved 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation (vs. 91.3% English-only), with consistent performance across 10 languages using a dataset of ~8M expressions across 177,620 images and 336,882 annotated objects.

Conclusion: The work establishes practical feasibility of multilingual visual grounding systems, demonstrating consistent capabilities across languages and providing a foundation for future multilingual REC research.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) requires models to localize objects in images based on natural language descriptions. Research on the area remains predominantly English-centric, despite increasing global deployment demands. This work addresses multilingual REC through two main contributions. First, we construct a unified multilingual dataset spanning 10 languages, by systematically expanding 12 existing English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based translation enhancement. The resulting dataset comprises approximately 8 million multilingual referring expressions across 177,620 images, with 336,882 annotated objects. Second, we introduce an attention-anchored neural architecture that uses multilingual SigLIP2 encoders. Our attention-based approach generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions, which are subsequently refined through learned residuals. Experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks, e.g. achieving 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation, compared to an English-only result of 91.3%. Multilingual evaluation shows consistent capabilities across languages, establishing the practical feasibility of multilingual visual grounding systems.

TL;DR: WEAVE is the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation, addressing the gap in multi-turn, context-dependent image creation and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing.

Method: WEAVE consists of two parts: WEAVE-100k (100K interleaved samples with 370K dialogue turns and 500K images) and WEAVEBench (human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks and 480 images using hybrid VLM judger evaluation).

Result: Training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities, facilitating emergent visual-memory capabilities in UMMs.

Conclusion: WEAVE provides a foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation, exposing persistent limitations of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

### [106] [Hi-DREAM: Brain Inspired Hierarchical Diffusion for fMRI Reconstruction via ROI Encoder and visuAl Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11437)
*Guowei Zhang,Yun Zhao,Moein Khajehnejad,Adeel Razi,Levin Kuhlmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-DREAM is a brain-inspired diffusion framework that explicitly models cortical hierarchy to decode fMRI signals into natural images, achieving state-of-the-art semantic reconstruction while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI-to-image decoders overlook the brain's hierarchical visual processing and fail to distinguish the distinct roles of early, middle, and late visual areas, limiting both performance and interpretability.

Method: Uses ROI adapter to group fMRI into early/mid/late streams, creates multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with U-Net depth, and employs depth-matched ControlNet to inject scale-specific hints during denoising.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD).

Conclusion: Structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful framework for studying visual cortex organization.

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VP-Bench is a new benchmark that systematically evaluates multimodal large language models' ability to perceive and utilize visual prompts like bounding boxes, addressing a critical gap in current MLLM evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack systematic evaluation for interpreting visual prompts (VPs) like bounding boxes, which are intuitive for humans when referring to specific image regions, making it unclear if models can effectively use this natural prompting method.

Method: A two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 tests VP perception in natural scenes using 30k visualized prompts across 8 shapes and 355 attribute combinations; Stage 2 examines VP impact on downstream tasks in real-world problem-solving scenarios.

Result: Evaluation of 28 MLLMs (including GPT-4o, InternVL3, Qwen2.5-VL) revealed comprehensive insights into factors affecting VP understanding, such as VP attribute variations, question arrangement, and model scale.

Conclusion: VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions, filling a critical gap in multimodal AI evaluation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

*Massimo Rizzoli,Simone Alghisi,Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning VLMs with controlled synthetic data generation improves performance and reduces biases compared to real-world data fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data collection for fine-tuning VLMs often introduces biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, leading to overfitting and imbalanced performance.

Method: Redesigned fine-tuning process with controlled synthetic data generation that comprehensively samples object attributes (color, shape, size, position) to ensure bias-free, balanced data with accurate annotations.

Result: Fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across visual scenes, mitigates common biases, and significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned with matched real data.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation with controlled attributes provides an effective alternative to real-world data collection for VLM fine-tuning, addressing bias and imbalance issues while improving transfer performance to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MaMOL framework for robust multimodal classification with missing modalities using dual-routing mechanism and parameter-efficient adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in multimodal remote sensing due to missing modalities from environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects. Existing methods are computationally expensive and assume complete data during training.

Method: Reformulates modality missing as multi-task learning with dual-routing: task-oriented dynamic router for missing patterns and modality-specific-shared static router for cross-modal knowledge. Uses lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse for parameter efficiency.

Result: Demonstrates superior robustness and generalization on remote sensing benchmarks under varying missing rates with minimal computational overhead. Transfer experiments validate scalability and cross-domain applicability.

Conclusion: MaMOL provides a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning that outperforms existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sat2RealCity is a 3D urban generation framework that creates realistic cities from satellite imagery using building-level generation, spatial priors, and appearance control, reducing reliance on costly 3D city assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D urban generation methods require expensive large-scale 3D city assets for training and rely on semantic/height maps that lack real-world appearance connection, limiting realism and generalizability.

Method: Uses OSM-based spatial priors for geometric generation, appearance-guided modeling for realism and style control, and MLLM-powered semantic-guided pipeline to bridge semantic interpretation with geometric reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments show Sat2RealCity significantly outperforms existing baselines in structural consistency and appearance realism, establishing strong foundation for real-world aligned 3D urban content.

Conclusion: The framework enables geometry-aware and appearance-controllable 3D urban generation from real satellite imagery, reducing dependency on large-scale 3D assets while achieving superior realism.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have substantially enhanced 3D urban generation, enabling applications in digital twins, virtual cities, and large-scale simulations. However, existing methods face two key challenges: (1) the need for large-scale 3D city assets for supervised training, which are difficult and costly to obtain, and (2) reliance on semantic or height maps, which are used exclusively for generating buildings in virtual worlds and lack connection to real-world appearance, limiting the realism and generalizability of generated cities. To address these limitations, we propose Sat2RealCity, a geometry-aware and appearance-controllable framework for 3D urban generation from real-world satellite imagery. Unlike previous city-level generation methods, Sat2RealCity builds generation upon individual building entities, enabling the use of rich priors and pretrained knowledge from 3D object generation while substantially reducing dependence on large-scale 3D city assets. Specifically, (1) we introduce the OSM-based spatial priors strategy to achieve interpretable geometric generation from spatial topology to building instances; (2) we design an appearance-guided controllable modeling mechanism for fine-grained appearance realism and style control; and (3) we construct an MLLM-powered semantic-guided generation pipeline, bridging semantic interpretation and geometric reconstruction. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that Sat2RealCity significantly surpasses existing baselines in structural consistency and appearance realism, establishing a strong foundation for real-world aligned 3D urban content creation. The code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PD-L1 assessment via immunohistochemistry is resource-intensive, creating need for automated alternatives from readily available H&E images.

Method: Built on nnUNet-v2, uses cyclic training with checkpoint sampling to approximate posterior distribution, enabling segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation.

Result: Achieves mean Dice Score 0.805 and mean IoU 0.709 on lung squamous cell carcinoma dataset, with uncertainty maps correlating strongly with segmentation error.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction shows promise for scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

TL;DR: OpenUS is the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model using vision Mamba backbone with self-adaptive masking framework, trained on 308K+ images from 42 public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound image interpretation is highly operator-dependent with variations across anatomical regions, protocols, and devices, hindering development of generalizable AI models due to speckle, low contrast, and limited annotations.

Method: Uses vision Mamba backbone for local/global dependencies, novel self-adaptive masking combining contrastive learning with masked image modeling, dynamic learning schedule, and trained on largest public ultrasound dataset (308K+ images from 42 datasets).

Result: Developed OpenUS foundation model that can be adapted to downstream tasks through label-efficient fine-tuning.

Conclusion: OpenUS provides a reproducible foundation model for ultrasound AI that addresses domain-specific challenges and enables efficient adaptation to various clinical applications.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is one of the most widely used medical imaging modalities, thanks to its low cost, portability, real-time feedback, and absence of ionizing radiation. However, US image interpretation remains highly operator-dependent and varies significantly across anatomical regions, acquisition protocols, and device types. These variations, along with unique challenges such as speckle, low contrast, and limited standardized annotations, hinder the development of generalizable, label-efficient ultrasound AI models. In this paper, we propose OpenUS, the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model built on a large collection of public data. OpenUS employs a vision Mamba backbone, capturing both local and global long-range dependencies across the image. To extract rich features during pre-training, we introduce a novel self-adaptive masking framework that combines contrastive learning with masked image modeling. This strategy integrates the teacher's attention map with student reconstruction loss, adaptively refining clinically-relevant masking to enhance pre-training effectiveness. OpenUS also applies a dynamic learning schedule to progressively adjust the difficulty of the pre-training process. To develop the foundation model, we compile the largest to-date public ultrasound dataset comprising over 308K images from 42 publicly available datasets, covering diverse anatomical regions, institutions, imaging devices, and disease types. Our pre-trained OpenUS model can be easily adapted to specific downstream tasks by serving as a backbone for label-efficient fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/XZheng0427/OpenUS.

*Benjamin Fein-Ashley,Jacob Fein-Ashley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIDGE proposes a lightweight fusion module using cross-attention layers near the top of vision and text encoders to align hidden states, achieving strong performance on retrieval and reasoning tasks while maintaining encoder efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM fusion methods either mix tokens early or compare pooled embeddings late, but the hidden states of both modalities already contain rich structure that can be directly aligned to match what each modality "thinks".

Method: A few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders project vision and text hidden states into shared space, attend across modalities, and send gated residual updates back with stabilizers for alignment.

Result: BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight fusion approach effectively aligns modality-specific structure in hidden states, achieving strong performance without compromising encoder understanding capabilities or generation decoupling.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

*Syed Mumtahin Mahmud,Mahdi Mohd Hossain Noki,Prothito Shovon Majumder,Abdul Mohaimen Al Radi,Md. Haider Ali,Md. Mosaddek Khan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes a dual-domain architecture combining Vision Transformers with FFT-ReLU for superior image deblurring by bridging spatial attention and frequency sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches (CNNs, ViTs) struggle with complex/high-resolution blur and computational demands in image deblurring tasks.

Method: Dual-domain architecture unifying Vision Transformers with frequency-domain FFT-ReLU module to bridge spatial attention modeling and frequency sparsity.

Result: Achieves superior PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality on benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art models, confirmed by quantitative metrics and human evaluations.

Conclusion: Establishes a practical and generalizable paradigm for real-world image restoration through effective dual-domain processing.

Abstract: Image deblurring is vital in computer vision, aiming to recover sharp images from blurry ones caused by motion or camera shake. While deep learning approaches such as CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have advanced this field, they often struggle with complex or high-resolution blur and computational demands. We propose a new dual-domain architecture that unifies Vision Transformers with a frequency-domain FFT-ReLU module, explicitly bridging spatial attention modeling and frequency sparsity. In this structure, the ViT backbone captures local and global dependencies, while the FFT-ReLU component enforces frequency-domain sparsity to suppress blur-related artifacts and preserve fine details. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that this architecture achieves superior PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art models. Both quantitative metrics, qualitative comparisons, and human preference evaluations confirm its effectiveness, establishing a practical and generalizable paradigm for real-world image restoration.

*Lihua Jian,Jiabo Liu,Shaowu Wu,Lihui Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: CLIPPan is an unsupervised pansharpening framework that uses CLIP as a supervisor to train models at full resolution, overcoming domain adaptation challenges between simulated and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised pansharpening methods face domain adaptation issues due to disparity between simulated training data and real-world full-resolution scenarios, creating a need for unsupervised approaches that can train directly at full resolution.

Method: Fine-tunes CLIP to recognize multispectral and panchromatic images, then uses semantic language constraints by aligning image fusion transitions with textual prompts (Wald's or Khan's descriptions) to guide fusion learning without ground truth.

Result: CLIPPan consistently improves spectral and spatial fidelity across various pansharpening backbones on real-world datasets, setting new state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised full-resolution pansharpening.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the domain adaptation gap in pansharpening by leveraging CLIP's capabilities with language supervision, enabling effective unsupervised training at full resolution.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in supervised pansharpening neural networks, these methods face domain adaptation challenges of resolution due to the intrinsic disparity between simulated reduced-resolution training data and real-world full-resolution scenarios.To bridge this gap, we propose an unsupervised pansharpening framework, CLIPPan, that enables model training at full resolution directly by taking CLIP, a visual-language model, as a supervisor. However, directly applying CLIP to supervise pansharpening remains challenging due to its inherent bias toward natural images and limited understanding of pansharpening tasks. Therefore, we first introduce a lightweight fine-tuning pipeline that adapts CLIP to recognize low-resolution multispectral, panchromatic, and high-resolution multispectral images, as well as to understand the pansharpening process. Then, building on the adapted CLIP, we formulate a novel \textit{loss integrating semantic language constraints}, which aligns image-level fusion transitions with protocol-aligned textual prompts (e.g., Wald's or Khan's descriptions), thus enabling CLIPPan to use language as a powerful supervisory signal and guide fusion learning without ground truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLIPPan consistently improves spectral and spatial fidelity across various pansharpening backbones on real-world datasets, setting a new state of the art for unsupervised full-resolution pansharpening.

*Ziyi Li,Qingyu Mao,Shuai Liu,Qilei Li,Fanyang Meng,Yongsheng Liang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes Online-RepNeRV, a neural video representation framework using online structural reparameterization to enhance model capacity without compromising decoding efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NVR methods have complex designs with high computational overhead and limited model capacity, creating performance bottlenecks in video compression.

Method: Uses ERB (universal reparameterization block) with multiple parallel convolutional paths, dynamically fused during training and converted to single-branch structure after training.

Result: Achieves 0.37-2.7 dB PSNR gain over baselines while maintaining comparable training time and decoding speed.

Conclusion: Online structural reparameterization effectively enhances NVR model capacity and performance without affecting decoding efficiency.

Abstract: Neural Video Representation~(NVR) is a promising paradigm for video compression, showing great potential in improving video storage and transmission efficiency. While recent advances have made efforts in architectural refinements to improve representational capability, these methods typically involve complex designs, which may incur increased computational overhead and lack the flexibility to integrate into other frameworks. Moreover, the inherent limitation in model capacity restricts the expressiveness of NVR networks, resulting in a performance bottleneck. To overcome these limitations, we propose Online-RepNeRV, a NVR framework based on online structural reparameterization. Specifically, we propose a universal reparameterization block named ERB, which incorporates multiple parallel convolutional paths to enhance the model capacity. To mitigate the overhead, an online reparameterization strategy is adopted to dynamically fuse the parameters during training, and the multi-branch structure is equivalently converted into a single-branch structure after training. As a result, the additional computational and parameter complexity is confined to the encoding stage, without affecting the decoding efficiency. Extensive experiments on mainstream video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an average PSNR gain of 0.37-2.7 dB over baseline methods, while maintaining comparable training time and decoding speed.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes modality-invariant representation learning for brain MRI foundation models, finding that lesion segmentation benefits more from preserving modality-specific features than cross-modality alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSL frameworks are designed for natural images and don't effectively capture multi-modal MRI information, limiting their utility in neuroimaging tasks like lesion segmentation.

Method: Developed a modality-invariant representation learning setup with large-scale pre-training on unlabeled brain MRI data, evaluated on stroke and epilepsy lesion segmentation tasks.

Result: Despite successful cross-modality alignment, lesion segmentation performance primarily improved by preserving fine-grained modality-specific features rather than modality-invariant representations.

Conclusion: For medical imaging tasks like lesion segmentation, preserving modality-specific features is more beneficial than achieving complete modality invariance in foundation model pre-training.

Abstract: The field of computer vision is undergoing a paradigm shift toward large-scale foundation model pre-training via self-supervised learning (SSL). Leveraging large volumes of unlabeled brain MRI data, such models can learn anatomical priors that improve few-shot performance in diverse neuroimaging tasks. However, most SSL frameworks are tailored to natural images, and their adaptation to capture multi-modal MRI information remains underexplored. This work proposes a modality-invariant representation learning setup and evaluates its effectiveness in stroke and epilepsy lesion segmentation, following large-scale pre-training. Experimental results suggest that despite successful cross-modality alignment, lesion segmentation primarily benefits from preserving fine-grained modality-specific features. Model checkpoints and code are made publicly available.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MoCo-INR is an unsupervised method combining implicit neural representations with motion-compensated framework for high-quality cardiac MRI reconstruction from highly undersampled data, achieving 20x acceleration with fine details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CMR reconstruction methods either produce unsatisfactory image quality or are limited by scarce ground truth data, restricting clinical applicability.

Method: Integrates implicit neural representations with conventional motion-compensated framework using explicit motion modeling and continuous INR priors, with a tailored INR network architecture for CMR.

Result: Superior performance over state-of-the-art methods with fast convergence and fine-detailed reconstructions at 20x acceleration, validated on both retrospective and prospective free-breathing CMR scans.

Conclusion: MoCo-INR demonstrates clinical practicality for real-time imaging and effectiveness through ablation studies confirming critical components.

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is widely used to characterize cardiac morphology and function. To accelerate CMR imaging, various methods have been proposed to recover high-quality spatiotemporal CMR images from highly undersampled k-t space data. However, current CMR reconstruction techniques either fail to achieve satisfactory image quality or are restricted by the scarcity of ground truth data, leading to limited applicability in clinical scenarios. In this work, we proposed MoCo-INR, a new unsupervised method that integrates implicit neural representations (INR) with the conventional motion-compensated (MoCo) framework. Using explicit motion modeling and the continuous prior of INRs, MoCo-INR can produce accurate cardiac motion decomposition and high-quality CMR reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a new INR network architecture tailored to the CMR problem, which significantly stabilizes model optimization. Experiments on retrospective (simulated) datasets demonstrate the superiority of MoCo-INR over state-of-the-art methods, achieving fast convergence and fine-detailed reconstructions at ultra-high acceleration factors (e.g., 20x in VISTA sampling). Additionally, evaluations on prospective (real-acquired) free-breathing CMR scans highlight the clinical practicality of MoCo-INR for real-time imaging. Several ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the critical components of MoCo-INR.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DualVision ArthroNav is a multi-camera arthroscopy navigation system that combines an external camera with the monocular arthroscope to resolve scale ambiguity and drift issues in vision-based navigation, achieving high accuracy and practical clinical deployment potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing optical tracking systems impose workspace constraints and disrupt surgical workflow, while vision-based alternatives using only the monocular arthroscope suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and sensitivity to motion/occlusion.

Method: Integrates an external camera rigidly mounted on the arthroscope to provide stable visual odometry and absolute localization, while the monocular arthroscope enables dense scene reconstruction, combining complementary views to resolve monocular SLAM limitations.

Result: Achieves average absolute trajectory error of 1.09 mm, reconstructed scenes with average target registration error of 2.16 mm, and high visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.69, PSNR = 22.19).

Conclusion: Provides a practical and cost-efficient solution for arthroscopic navigation that bridges optical tracking and purely vision-based systems, paving the way for clinically deployable, fully vision-based arthroscopic guidance.

Abstract: Arthroscopic procedures can greatly benefit from navigation systems that enhance spatial awareness, depth perception, and field of view. However, existing optical tracking solutions impose strict workspace constraints and disrupt surgical workflow. Vision-based alternatives, though less invasive, often rely solely on the monocular arthroscope camera, making them prone to drift, scale ambiguity, and sensitivity to rapid motion or occlusion. We propose DualVision ArthroNav, a multi-camera arthroscopy navigation system that integrates an external camera rigidly mounted on the arthroscope. The external camera provides stable visual odometry and absolute localization, while the monocular arthroscope video enables dense scene reconstruction. By combining these complementary views, our system resolves the scale ambiguity and long-term drift inherent in monocular SLAM and ensures robust relocalization. Experiments demonstrate that our system effectively compensates for calibration errors, achieving an average absolute trajectory error of 1.09 mm. The reconstructed scenes reach an average target registration error of 2.16 mm, with high visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.69, PSNR = 22.19). These results indicate that our system provides a practical and cost-efficient solution for arthroscopic navigation, bridging the gap between optical tracking and purely vision-based systems, and paving the way toward clinically deployable, fully vision-based arthroscopic guidance.

### [120] [The Second Law of Intelligence: Controlling Ethical Entropy in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10704)
*Samih Fadli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Second Law of AI thermodynamics where ethical entropy increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work, and provides a quantitative framework for maintaining AI stability through alignment work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a thermodynamic analogy for AI alignment, showing that unconstrained AI systems naturally drift from intended goals without continuous alignment efforts, similar to entropy increase in thermodynamics.

Method: Defined ethical entropy S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta) over goals {g_i}, proved dS/dt >= 0, derived critical alignment work boundary gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, and validated with simulations on 7-billion-parameter models.

Result: Unregularized 7B-parameter model drifted from initial entropy 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while system with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintained stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17).

Conclusion: AI alignment should be treated as continuous thermodynamic control, providing quantitative foundation for maintaining stability and safety of autonomous systems through sufficient alignment work.

Abstract: We propose that unconstrained artificial intelligence obeys a Second Law analogous to thermodynamics, where ethical entropy, defined as a measure of divergence from intended goals, increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work. For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems.

*Yuan Zhao,Hualei Zhu,Tingyu Jiang,Shen Li,Xiaohang Xu,Hao Henry Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-EPG is a self-iterative training framework that enables co-evolution of planning and grounding capabilities for GUI agents through iterative feedback loops and self-play optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance without external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI automation methods have two key limitations: insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies between planning and grounding, and over-reliance on synthetic data generation without adequate utilization.

Method: Co-EPG establishes an iterative feedback loop where the planning model explores strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model, which in turn provides better rewards for subsequent planning model training.

Result: On Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, Co-EPG outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data, with consistent improvement in each iteration.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents that shifts from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) task automation constitutes a critical frontier in artificial intelligence research. While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities. This work establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents, shifting from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach.

TL;DR: The paper reframes Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, conducts axiomatic analysis of quality measures, introduces a new measure called directed coverage, analyzes computational complexity, and shows experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce cognitive load on decision makers by computing fixed-size subsets of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, addressing unintuitive behaviors in existing quality measures.

Method: Reframing Pareto pruning as multiwinner voting, conducting axiomatic analysis of quality measures, introducing directed coverage measure, computational complexity analysis, and experimental evaluation.

Result: Uncovered unintuitive behaviors in existing measures, identified tractability boundaries, and showed that choice of quality measure significantly impacts solution set characteristics with proposed measure performing competitively.

Conclusion: The proposed directed coverage measure performs favorably across settings, and careful selection of quality measures is crucial for effective Pareto pruning in multi-objective optimization.

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.

TL;DR: Novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT that linearly preserve clique-width, enabling efficient solving for dense graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand encoding capabilities with clique-width for computational problems, using abstract argumentation as a framework since it's based on directed graphs and computationally challenging.

Method: Designed directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT that linearly preserve clique-width.

Result: Established novel results for all argumentation semantics including counting, with reductions that cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

Conclusion: Successfully initiated understanding of encoding capabilities with clique-width through novel DDG reductions for abstract argumentation problems.

Abstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces two new counterfactual decision-making metrics: PoR (probability of potential outcome ranking) and PoB (probability of achieving best potential outcome), with identification theorems, bounds, estimation methods, and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve counterfactual decision-making under uncertainty by providing more informative metrics that reveal the most probable ranking of potential outcomes and identify actions most likely to yield top-ranked outcomes for individuals.

Method: Developed identification theorems and bounds for PoR and PoB metrics, created estimation methods, and conducted numerical experiments to validate finite-sample properties and real-world application.

Result: Successfully established theoretical foundations for PoR and PoB metrics, derived their bounds, and demonstrated practical applicability through numerical experiments and real-world dataset analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed PoR and PoB metrics provide valuable tools for counterfactual decision-making, offering more nuanced insights into outcome rankings and best-outcome probabilities for individual decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.

TL;DR: This survey reframes LLM reasoning through adaptivity - allocating reasoning effort based on task difficulty and uncertainty, proposing a taxonomy of training-based and training-free methods for adaptive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing on difficult tasks. The survey addresses this fundamental limitation by focusing on adaptive reasoning.

Method: The authors formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning in LLMs, frame adaptive reasoning as control-augmented policy optimization, and propose a taxonomy organizing methods into training-based (reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, learned controllers) and training-free approaches (prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, modular composition).

Result: The framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies for allocating reasoning effort.

Conclusion: The survey identifies open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control, providing a foundation for future research in adaptive reasoning for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embedding methods face critical limitations: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations.

Method: Uses relation-specific space weighting to dynamically select optimal geometries for each relation type, with multi-space consistency loss for coherent predictions across spaces.

Result: Achieves 0.612 MRR on 10M-paper dataset (4.8% relative gain over best baseline), with 85 ms inference per triple and near-linear scaling with graph size.

Conclusion: HyperComplEx provides a scalable, adaptive framework that outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various knowledge graph sizes while maintaining efficient training and inference.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

Conclusion: Demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

Abstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

TL;DR: A planning support system with agentic AI that creates dynamic, demand-oriented regions for disaster planning using a modified self-organizing map approach with human-in-the-loop interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional planning units like census tracts or zip codes often fail to capture local community needs and lack flexibility for effective hazard prevention and response strategies.

Method: Built on RepSC-SOM (representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map) with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, plus AI agents that suggest input features, guide spatial constraints, and support interactive exploration.

Conclusion: The platform successfully integrates agentic AI with human-in-the-loop principles to create transparent and adaptable dynamic planning units for disaster planning, bridging computational methods with user needs.

Abstract: Conventional planning units or urban regions, such as census tracts, zip codes, or neighborhoods, often do not capture the specific demands of local communities and lack the flexibility to implement effective strategies for hazard prevention or response. To support the creation of dynamic planning units, we introduce a planning support system with agentic AI that enables users to generate demand-oriented regions for disaster planning, integrating the human-in-the-loop principle for transparency and adaptability. The platform is built on a representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map (RepSC-SOM), extending traditional SOM with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, while AI agents can reason, plan, and act to guide the process by suggesting input features, guiding spatial constraints, and supporting interactive exploration. We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform through a case study on the flooding-related risk in Jacksonville, Florida, showing how it allows users to explore, generate, and evaluate regionalization interactively, combining computational rigor with user-driven decision making.

*Tiantian He,An Zhao,Elinor Thompson,Anna Schroder,Ahmed Abdulaal,Frederik Barkhof,Daniel C. Alexander*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance learning of neurodegenerative disease progression by constructing biologically-constrained interaction graphs among brain regions from irregular longitudinal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods oversimplify brain connectivity by assuming single-modality connectomes as disease-spreading substrates, leading to inaccurate predictions. Data-driven approaches face identifiability issues due to lack of proper constraints.

Method: Uses LLMs as expert guides to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing long-term disease trajectories and biologically-constrained graph structures.

Result: Demonstrated superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches using tau-PET imaging data from Alzheimer's disease cohort, revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

Conclusion: The LLM-enhanced framework provides a more accurate and interpretable approach for modeling neurodegenerative disease progression by leveraging multi-modal relationships and biological constraints.

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

TL;DR: Multi-agent legal verifier for AI data transfer compliance under Japanese APPI regulations achieves 72% accuracy, significantly outperforming single-agent baseline by 21 percentage points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning is critical under stringent privacy regulations like Japanese APPI, requiring automated and trustworthy compliance verification.

Method: Multi-agent system with specialized agents for statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment, coordinated through structured synthesis protocol.

Result: 72% overall accuracy (21pp higher than baseline), 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs 16% baseline), perfect detection of clear violations, evaluated on 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases.

Conclusion: Domain specialization and coordinated reasoning meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy automated compliance verification.

Abstract: Legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning is becoming increasingly critical under stringent privacy regulations such as the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI). We propose a multi-agent legal verifier that decomposes compliance checking into specialized agents for statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment, coordinated through a structured synthesis protocol. Evaluated on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with clearly defined ground truth labels and multiple performance metrics, the system achieves 72% accuracy, which is 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline, including 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% for the baseline) while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations. While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.

*Steven J. Jones,Robert E. Wray,John E. Laird*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI systems need to construct and evaluate courses of action in novel scenarios where no available option fully satisfies all constraints, requiring integration of normative, pragmatic, and situational knowledge beyond trained policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous AI systems inevitably encounter novel situations where no pre-trained policy fully satisfies all operational constraints, requiring them to construct and justify new courses of action aligned with human values.

Method: Characterizes requirements for agent decision making through analysis and empirical case studies, examining how agents integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding.

Result: Identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to goals and aligned with human expectations in complex real-world environments.

Conclusion: Agents must go beyond trained policies to construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action by integrating multiple types of contextual knowledge for robust and aligned decision making.

Abstract: Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual "knowledge" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.

TL;DR: Automated AI agent framework using LLMs to construct product knowledge graphs from unstructured product descriptions, achieving 97% property coverage with minimal redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges from vast unstructured e-commerce data by automating knowledge graph construction, which is typically manual and complex.

Method: Three-stage agent-driven approach: ontology creation/expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population using LLMs without predefined schemas.

Result: Evaluated on air conditioner dataset - achieved over 97% property coverage and minimal redundancy in both ontology generation and KG population.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively automate structured knowledge extraction for retail, providing scalable product data integration and utilization.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of e-commerce platforms generates vast amounts of unstructured product data, creating significant challenges for information retrieval, recommendation systems, and data analytics. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a structured, interpretable format to organize such data, yet constructing product-specific KGs remains a complex and manual process. This paper introduces a fully automated, AI agent-driven framework for constructing product knowledge graphs directly from unstructured product descriptions. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our method operates in three stages using dedicated agents: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population. This agent-based approach ensures semantic coherence, scalability, and high-quality output without relying on predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules. We evaluate the system on a real-world dataset of air conditioner product descriptions, demonstrating strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population. The framework achieves over 97\% property coverage and minimal redundancy, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs to automate structured knowledge extraction in retail, providing a scalable path toward intelligent product data integration and utilization.

### [134] [Faster Symmetry Breaking Constraints for Abstract Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11029)
*Özgür Akgün,Mun See Chang,Ian P. Gent,Christopher Jefferson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new incomplete method for breaking symmetries of abstract structures in constraint programming by exploiting their representations, specifically for indistinguishable objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symmetry breaking in constraint programming speeds up solving but applying traditional methods to abstract variables produces complex constraints that perform poorly.

Method: Exploit representations of abstract structures to break symmetries, focusing on indistinguishable objects as a common symmetry type.

Result: The new method is faster than previous approaches proposed in Akgün et al. 2025.

Conclusion: Better exploitation of abstract structure representations enables more efficient symmetry breaking in constraint programming.

Abstract: In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to "break" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel role allocation strategy called "Truth Last" that improves Multi-Agent Debate performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks, and proposes MADC strategy to handle unknown truth scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Role allocation strategies in Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) are underexplored despite their significant impact on reasoning performance, and practical applications face the challenge of unknown truth.

Method: Proposed "Truth Last" role allocation strategy and Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy that uses path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles and simulates the role with highest consistency as truth.

Result: MADC demonstrated advanced performance across 9 LLM models on challenging reasoning tasks, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks with up to 22% improvement.

Conclusion: MADC provides a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling by systematically optimizing role allocation and handling unknown truth scenarios.

Abstract: Recent studies on LLM agent scaling have highlighted the potential of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to enhance reasoning abilities. However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, "Truth Last", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks and providing a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling.

TL;DR: DSS is a planning framework that uses differentiable simulation (Waymax) as both next-state predictor and critic, enabling gradient-based optimization of action sequences for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planning is crucial for safe autonomous driving in complex traffic, but learning all components (policy, predictor, critic) is challenging. DSS addresses this by leveraging differentiable simulation.

Method: Uses differentiable simulator Waymax for accurate state predictions and gradient-based search across action sequences. Combines planning gradients with stochastic search to optimize actions.

Result: DSS significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

Conclusion: The combination of planning gradients and stochastic search in DSS provides superior planning performance for autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARCTraj is a dataset and framework that captures human reasoning steps in ARC tasks through temporal action trajectories, enabling better study of reasoning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ARC approaches use static input-output supervision, lacking insight into how reasoning unfolds over time and intermediate steps.

Method: Collects 10,000 human reasoning trajectories via O2ARC interface, defines unified reasoning pipeline with MDP formulation, and integrates with RL, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods.

Result: Captures object-level actions revealing intermediate reasoning steps, enables analysis of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence patterns.

Conclusion: ARCTraj provides a structured foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.

Abstract: We present ARCTraj, a dataset and methodological framework for modeling human reasoning through complex visual tasks in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.

TL;DR: A simple method for generalised planning that computes optimal plans for training problems, performs goal regression, and lifts the results to create first-order Condition→Actions rules that form a generalised plan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective approach for synthesising programs that can solve families of related planning problems, improving upon existing generalised planning methods.

Method: For each training problem, compute optimal plans for goal atoms in order, perform goal regression on the plans, and lift outputs to obtain first-order Condition→Actions rules that collectively form a generalised plan.

Result: The method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generalised planners in synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality across various classical and numeric planning domains.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a simple yet effective method for learning valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing techniques.

Abstract: Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GGBench is a benchmark for evaluating geometric generative reasoning in Unified Multimodal Models, bridging the gap between discriminative understanding and unconstrained image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning in UMMs, focusing only on separate aspects of understanding or generation.

Method: Proposed geometric construction as an ideal testbed that demands fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation, creating GGBench benchmark.

Result: GGBench provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing models' ability to understand, reason, and actively construct solutions through geometric tasks.

Conclusion: Geometric construction sets a more rigorous standard for evaluating the next generation of intelligent systems by testing integrated generative reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

*Dayong Liang,Xiao-Yong Wei,Changmeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MUG introduces a multi-agent undercover gaming protocol that detects hallucinating agents through counterfactual tests with modified images, improving multimodal reasoning reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) which assumes all agents are rational, when in reality LLMs are prone to hallucinations that undermine consensus-based approaches.

Method: Uses social deduction game principles to identify 'undercover' hallucinating agents through multimodal counterfactual tests - modifying reference images and observing agents' ability to detect changes.

Result: Provides ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enables more robust multimodal reasoning through factual verification beyond statistical consensus.

Conclusion: MUG offers a more reliable framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs by enabling counterfactual testing, cross-evidence reasoning, and active probing discussions among agents.

Abstract: Hallucination continues to pose a major obstacle in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like "Who is Undercover?". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting "undercover" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.

TL;DR: STaR is a framework that enhances table reasoning in LLMs by incorporating slow-thinking capabilities through step-by-step reasoning and uncertainty-aware inference, achieving superior performance and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based table reasoning lacks depth, iterative refinement, and stability, limiting their reliability in practical applications.

Method: Uses two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning for training and trajectory-level uncertainty quantification during inference by combining token-level confidence and answer consistency.

Result: Achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability on benchmarks, with strong generalization to out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: STaR provides a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs, demonstrating potential for building more intelligent systems.

Abstract: Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

Powered by an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model for ILs, AIonopedia enables accurate property predictions and incorporates a hierarchical search architecture for molecular screening and design. Trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive IL dataset, our model delivers superior performance. Complementing these results, evaluations on literature-reported systems indicate that the agent can perform effective IL modification. Moving beyond offline tests, the practical efficacy was further confirmed through real-world wet-lab validation, in which the agent demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities on challenging out-of-distribution tasks, underscoring its ability to accelerate real-world IL discovery.

### [144] [A Workflow for Full Traceability of AI Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11275)
*Julius Wenzel,Syeda Umaima Alam,Andreas Schmidt,Hanwei Zhang,Holger Hermanns*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a workflow for generating tamper-proof, verifiable traces of AI decisions to establish accountability and responsibility chains for automated decision systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of brittle AI systems in high-stake decisions creates substantial risks of harm to people's well-being and fundamental rights, with current systems lacking proper documentation that could establish responsibility in legal contexts.

Method: The paper enforces documentation of every component in AI training and inference processes, expanding the DBOM concept into a running workflow that leverages confidential computing technology to generate tamper-proof, verifiable traces.

Result: The authors demonstrate a working workflow through the development of a mushroom classification app (poisonous vs. edible) as a playful example of high-stake decision support, showing how comprehensive documentation can be achieved.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical solution for establishing traceability and accountability in AI decision-making, creating documentation that can withstand legal scrutiny when AI systems violate laws or cause harm.

Abstract: An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.
  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.

*Patrick Koopmann,Yasir Mahmood,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo,Balram Tiwari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces contrastive ABox explanations to answer 'Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?' by considering both positive and missing entailments simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches explain positive entailments and missing entailments separately, but contrastive explanations can focus on relevant commonalities and differences between instances.

Method: Developed notion of contrastive explanations for ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, analyzed computational complexity for different variants under optimality criteria, and implemented a method for computing one variant.

Result: Analyzed computational complexity across different description logics and implemented a working method that was evaluated on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

Conclusion: Contrastive explanations provide a unified approach to explain both why an instance belongs to a concept and why another does not, focusing on the differences between them.

Abstract: We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

*Ruoxi Cheng,Haoxuan Ma,Teng Ma,Hongyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcoAlign is an inference-time framework that treats LVLM alignment as an economic efficiency problem, using forward-looking cost-benefit analysis to balance safety, utility, and computational costs during reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLM alignment methods struggle with trade-offs between safety, utility, and operational costs, and are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks where harmful reasoning is disguised with benign justifications.

Method: EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against remaining budget, enforcing path safety via weakest-link principle.

Result: Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at lower computational cost.

Conclusion: EcoAlign offers a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment by reframing alignment as an economically rational search problem.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit powerful reasoning capabilities but suffer sophisticated jailbreak vulnerabilities. Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.

*Yitian Kou,Yihe Gu,Chen Zhou,DanDan Zhu,Shuguang Kuai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLSLM is a hybrid reinforcement learning framework that combines rule-based social locomotion models with data-driven learning for socially-aware navigation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in user experience while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between interpretable but inflexible rule-based approaches and powerful but opaque data-driven methods for social navigation in human-populated environments.

Method: Integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model (grounded in empirical behavioral experiments) into RL reward function, generating orientation-sensitive social comfort fields and jointly optimizing mechanical energy and social comfort.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience through VR-based human-agent interaction experiments, with significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

Abstract: Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

TL;DR: MarsRL is a reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism that improves multi-agent reasoning systems by jointly optimizing all agents, achieving significant accuracy gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent reasoning systems work well with closed-source models but struggle with open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities, limiting their generalization potential.

Method: Proposes MarsRL framework with agent-specific reward mechanisms to reduce reward noise and pipeline-inspired training for efficient handling of long trajectories, jointly optimizing all agents in the system.

Result: Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improved AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing the larger Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 model.

Conclusion: MarsRL demonstrates strong potential to advance multi-agent reasoning systems and broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks, particularly for open-source models.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has been propelled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and test-time scaling. However, the limited output length of LLMs constrains the depth of reasoning attainable in a single inference process. Multi-agent reasoning systems offer a promising alternative by employing multiple agents including Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, to iteratively refine solutions. While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities. To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system. MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to enhance efficiency in handling long trajectories. Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improves AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507. These findings highlight the potential of MarsRL to advance multi-agent reasoning systems and broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MARL approaches assume ideal communication conditions (instantaneous, reliable, unlimited bandwidth) that are rarely met in real-world deployments, creating a gap between theory and practice.

Method: Systematic review of recent advances in communication strategies for MARL, focusing on three key applications: cooperative autonomous driving, distributed SLAM, and federated learning.

Result: Identified that robust communication strategies can address real-world constraints and enable practical MARL implementations across various domains.

Conclusion: Advocates for a unified co-design approach that integrates communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations, with identified open challenges for future research.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.

TL;DR: CURENet is a multimodal model that integrates clinical notes, lab tests, and time-series visit data using LLMs and transformers to predict chronic diseases with over 94% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most predictive models fail to capture interactions and temporal patterns across multiple EHR data modalities, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive patient health views for clinical decision-making.

Method: Uses large language models for clinical text and lab test processing, and transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visit data to integrate multimodal EHR data.

Result: Achieved over 94% accuracy in predicting top 10 chronic conditions on MIMIC-III and FEMH datasets in multi-label classification.

Conclusion: Multimodal EHR integration using CURENet shows strong potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes for chronic disease prediction.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

*Adam Stein,Matthew Trager,Benjamin Bowman,Michael Kleinman,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGuR is an AI system that dynamically generates tailored computational strategies at inference time using accumulated experience, enabling flexible adaptation of prompts, sampling parameters, tools, and control logic without offline optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI systems either only modify textual inputs (limiting adaptation) or require offline optimization (remaining static after deployment), creating a need for systems that can flexibly adapt all strategy components during inference.

Method: EGuR uses an LLM-based meta-strategy with two components: a Guide that generates candidate strategies based on current problem and past experiences, and a Consolidator that integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation.

Result: Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieved up to 14% accuracy improvements over strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.

Conclusion: EGuR enables dynamic, experience-guided strategy generation at inference time, producing optimized computational procedures that improve performance and efficiency while adapting to accumulated experience.

Abstract: Enabling agentic AI systems to adapt their problem-solving approaches based on post-training interactions remains a fundamental challenge. While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Test-time alignment technique using model-guided policy shaping to control AI agent behavior without retraining, enabling ethical alignment while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents trained to maximize rewards may adopt harmful behaviors, creating a trade-off between reward maximization and ethical alignment. Retraining pre-trained agents is costly and slow.

Method: Model-guided policy shaping applied at test time using scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes, without requiring agent retraining.

Result: Effective mitigation of unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes in the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, outperforming training-time methods and general-purpose agents.

Conclusion: Test-time policy shaping provides a scalable solution for maintaining AI agent alignment with ethical values while preserving reward performance, without the need for costly retraining.

Abstract: The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.

### [154] [Support Recovery in One-bit Compressed Sensing with Near-Optimal Measurements and Sublinear Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10777)
*Xiaxin Li,Arya Mazumdar*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes sublinear runtime schemes for support recovery in one-bit compressed sensing, improving from Ω(n) to o(n) runtime with slightly increased measurement complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing support recovery methods in one-bit compressed sensing have Ω(n) runtime, which is inefficient for high-dimensional problems. The goal is to develop algorithms with sublinear o(n) runtime while maintaining recovery guarantees.

Method: Two main schemes: (1) Universal recovery with exact and approximate variants using structured measurements and efficient algorithms, (2) Probabilistic exact recovery in sublinear regime with vanishing error probability.

Result: Achieved sublinear runtime: O(km) for exact recovery and O(ε^{-1}m) for approximate recovery, with measurement complexities m=O(k²log(n/k)log n) and m=O(kε^{-1}log(n/k)log n) respectively. Also achieved m=O(k(log k/log log k)log n) for probabilistic recovery.

Conclusion: The proposed schemes significantly improve runtime from linear to sublinear in n, making support recovery in one-bit compressed sensing more practical for high-dimensional applications, with only logarithmic overhead in measurement complexity.

Abstract: The problem of support recovery in one-bit compressed sensing (1bCS) aim to recover the support of a signal $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$, denoted as supp$(x)$, from the observation $y=\text{sign}(Ax)$, where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is a sensing matrix and $|\text{supp}(x)|\leq k, k \ll n$. Under this setting, most preexisting works have a recovery runtime $Ω(n)$. In this paper, we propose two schemes that have sublinear $o(n)$ runtime. (1.i): For the universal exact support recovery, a scheme of $m=O(k^2\log(n/k)\log n)$ measurements and runtime $D=O(km)$. (1.ii): For the universal $ε$-approximate support recovery, the same scheme with $m=O(kε^{-1}\log(n/k)\log n)$ and runtime $D=O(ε^{-1}m)$, improving the runtime significantly with an extra $O(\log n)$ factor in the number of measurements compared to the current optimal (Matsumoto et al., 2023). (2): For the probabilistic exact support recovery in the sublinear regime, a scheme of $m:=O(k\frac{\log k}{\log\log k}\log n)$ measurements and runtime $O(m)$, with vanishing error probability, improving the recent result of Yang et al., 2025.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper proposes integrating intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA) technologies into SWIPT systems to enhance information transmission for IDRs and improve power reception for EHRs, addressing the challenge of inefficient wireless power transfer due to distance attenuation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SWIPT suffers from severe attenuation in long-distance propagation, leading to inefficient wireless power transfer for energy harvesting receivers in IoT networks. The authors aim to overcome this limitation by leveraging emerging IRS and MA technologies.

Method: The authors develop an optimization framework that jointly optimizes active and passive beamforming at the BS and IRS, along with MA positions, using a combination of WMMSE, BCD, MM, and PDD algorithms. They also present a feasibility characterization method for EHR requirements.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvements. Notably, the optimized IRS configuration shows higher performance gain compared to MA under the considered scenario.

Conclusion: The integration of IRS and MA technologies effectively enhances SWIPT system performance, with IRS demonstrating particular effectiveness in improving information transmission and power reception capabilities.

Abstract: Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has been envisioned as a promising technology to support ubiquitous connectivity and reliable sustainability in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, which, however, generally suffers from severe attenuation caused by long distance propagation, leading to inefficient wireless power transfer (WPT) for energy harvesting receivers (EHRs). This paper proposes to introduce emerging intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA) technologies into SWIPT systems aiming at enhancing information transmission for information decoding receivers (IDRs) and improving receive power of EHRs. We consider to maximize the weighted sum-rate of IDRs via jointly optimizing the active and passive beamforming at the base station (BS) and IRS, respectively, as well as the positions of MAs, while guaranteeing the requirements of all EHRs. To tackle this challenging task due to the non-convexity of associated optimization, we develop an efficient algorithm combining weighted minimal mean square error (WMMSE), block coordinate descent (BCD), majorization-minimization (MM), and penalty duality decomposition (PDD) frameworks. Besides, we present a feasibility characterization method to examine the achievability of EHRs' requirements. Simulation results demonstrate the significant benefits of our proposed solutions. Particularly, the optimized IRS configuration may exhibit higher performance gain than MA counterpart under our considered scenario.

*Zhaolin Wang,Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe,Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu,Yuanwei Liu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Study of mutual coupling in continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs) with polarization effects, developing optimal beamforming methods and extending to discrete arrays, showing coupled models provide more accurate physical modeling than uncoupled ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and model mutual coupling effects in continuous aperture arrays, particularly accounting for polarization and surface dissipation losses, which invalidate conventional design rules like half-wavelength spacing.

Method: Developed a general physical model for mutual coupling, characterized the unipolarized coupling kernel, formulated beamforming as functional optimization, proposed kernel approximation and conjugate gradient methods for solution, and extended model to spatially discrete arrays.

Result: Polarization induces anisotropic coupling, coupled SPDA performance converges to CAPA limit while uncoupled models violate physics, polarization causes anisotropic array gain, and coupled beampatterns exhibit higher directivity than uncoupled ones.

Conclusion: The proposed continuous mutual coupling model provides physically accurate modeling for both continuous and discrete arrays, demonstrating that coupled models are essential for proper array design and outperform uncoupled approaches in terms of physical validity and performance.

Abstract: The phenomenon of mutual coupling in continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs) is studied. First, a general physical model for the phenomenon that accounts for both polarization and surface dissipation losses is developed. Then, the unipolarized coupling kernel is characterized, revealing that polarization induces anisotropic coupling and invalidates the conventional half-wavelength spacing rule for coupling elimination. Next, the beamforming design problem for CAPAs with coupling is formulated as a functional optimization problem, leading to the derivation of optimal beamforming structures via the calculus of variations. To address the challenge of inverting the coupling kernel in the optimal structure, two methods are proposed: 1) the kernel approximation method, which yields a closed-form solution via wavenumber-domain transformation and GaussLegendre quadrature, and 2) the conjugate gradient method, which addresses an equivalent quadratic functional optimization problem iteratively. Furthermore, the optimal array gain and beampattern are analyzed at the large-aperture limit. Finally, the proposed continuous mutual coupling model is extended to spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs), and comprehensive numerical results are provided, demonstrating that: 1) coupled SPDA performance correctly converges to the CAPA limit, while uncoupled models are shown to violate physics, 2) polarization results in anisotropic array gain behavior, and 3) the coupled beampattern exhibits higher directivity than the uncoupled beampattern.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Proposes SCL decoding for non-binary linear block codes over F_{2^r} fields using a one-to-r mapping to binary polar codes, achieving sub-quadratic complexity and outperforming state-of-the-art soft-decision decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient soft-decision decoding of non-binary linear block codes remains challenging despite their importance in correcting burst errors and broad applications in communications and storage systems.

Method: Establishes a one-to-r mapping between non-binary codewords and r binary polar codewords, enabling SCL decoding of polar codes with sub-quadratic complexity. Uses an r-step decoding path sorting strategy.

Result: SCL decoding outperforms state-of-the-art soft-decision decoding for extended Reed-Solomon and non-binary extended BCH codes with fewer finite field arithmetic operations. For length-16 eRS codes, ML decoding performance is approached with moderate list size.

Conclusion: The proposed SCL decoding method provides an efficient solution for soft-decision decoding of non-binary linear block codes, achieving near-ML performance with reduced computational complexity.

Abstract: Non-binary linear block codes (NB-LBCs) are an important class of error-correcting codes that are especially competent in correcting burst errors. They have broad applications in modern communications and storage systems. However, efficient soft-decision decoding of these codes remains challenging. This paper proposes successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding for NB-LBCs that are defined over a finite field of characteristic two, i.e., F_{2^r}, where r is the extension degree. By establishing a one-to-r mapping between the binary composition of each non-binary codeword and r binary polar codewords, SCL decoding of the r polar codes can be performed with a complexity that is sub-quadratic in the codeword length. An r-step decoding path sorting strategy is further proposed to facilitate the decoding. Simulation results on extended Reed-Solomon (eRS) and non-binary extended BCH (NB-eBCH) codes show that SCL decoding can outperform their state-of-the-art soft-decision decoding with fewer finite field arithmetic operations. For length-16 eRS codes, their maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding performances can be approached with a moderate list size.

TL;DR: Proposes an optimization framework for transmissive RIS-based multi-user MIMO systems, using alternating optimization to maximize sum-rate with rapid convergence and significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transmissive RIS enables low-cost, energy-efficient wireless transmitters, but joint optimization of RIS coefficients, power allocation, and beamforming is challenging due to non-convexity and coupled variables.

Method: Reformulates sum-rate maximization into tractable form and develops alternating optimization algorithm with convex approximation and difference-of-convex programming for RIS coefficients, receive beamformers, and power allocation.

Result: Simulations show rapid convergence and substantial sum-rate gains over conventional schemes, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: Transmissive RIS shows great potential as a key technology for next-generation wireless systems with the proposed optimization framework enabling efficient performance.

Abstract: Transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) represent a transformative architecture for future wireless networks, enabling a paradigm shift from traditional costly base stations to low-cost, energy-efficient transmitters. This paper explores a downlink multi-user MIMO system where a transmissive RIS, illuminated by a single feed antenna, forms the core of the transmitter. The joint optimization of the RIS coefficient vector, power allocation, and receive beamforming in such a system is critical for performance but poses significant challenges due to the non-convex objective, coupled variables, and constant modulus constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel optimization framework. Our approach involves reformulating the sum-rate maximization problem into a tractable equivalent form and developing an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. This algorithm decomposes the problem into subproblems for the RIS coefficients, receive beamformers, and power allocation, each solved using advanced techniques including convex approximation and difference-of-convex programming. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method converges rapidly and achieves substantial sum-rate gains over conventional schemes, validating the effectiveness of our approach and highlighting the potential of transmissive RIS as a key technology for next-generation wireless systems.

*Masih Aminbeidokhti,Subhankar Roy,Eric Granger,Elisa Ricci,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LT-Soups is a two-stage model soups framework that addresses the head-tail accuracy trade-off in long-tailed datasets by first averaging models from balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias, then fine-tuning only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models but do so at the cost of head-class accuracy, with the head-tail ratio being a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off.

Method: Two-stage model soups framework: (1) Average models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias, (2) Fine-tune only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy.

Result: LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across six benchmark datasets and a wide range of imbalance regimes, excelling in diverse long-tailed distributions.

Conclusion: LT-Soups effectively addresses the head-tail accuracy trade-off in long-tailed learning by combining balanced subset averaging with classifier fine-tuning, providing robust performance across various imbalance scenarios.

Abstract: Real-world datasets typically exhibit long-tailed (LT) distributions, where a few head classes dominate and many tail classes are severely underrepresented. While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($ρ$) and head-tail ratio ($η$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy. Experiments across six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across a wide range of imbalance regimes.

### [160] [Differentiable Sparse Identification of Lagrangian Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10706)
*Zitong Zhang,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable sparse identification framework for discovering governing equations from noisy data using Lagrangian formalism with cubic B-spline approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse regression techniques struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems, while current Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data.

Method: Integrates cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, uses robust equation discovery with physical constraints, and implements recursive derivative computation based on B-spline basis functions.

Result: The method demonstrates superior performance in extracting physical laws from noisy data, particularly in complex mechanical systems, compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables more accurate and reliable discovery of governing equations from noisy data through the combination of B-spline approximation and Lagrangian formalism.

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of governing equations from data remains a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics. Although sparse regression techniques have advanced system identification, they struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems. The Lagrangian formalism offers a promising alternative, as it typically avoids rational expressions and provides a more concise representation of system dynamics. However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and enables more accurate and reliable extraction of physical laws from noisy data, particularly in complex mechanical systems compared to baseline methods.

*Sirui Liang,Pengfei Cao,Jian Zhao,Cong Huang,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BREP ReFT improves mathematical reasoning in parameter-efficient finetuning by optimizing initial reasoning prefixes, preventing early-stage error accumulation, and preserving numerical encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReFT methods show poor performance on mathematical reasoning tasks due to ineffective reasoning prefix generation and numerical encoding disturbance.

Method: Proposes BREP ReFT with three key components: truncating training data for better prefix generation, early inference intervention to prevent error accumulation, and constraining intervention vectors to preserve numerical encoding.

Result: Extensive experiments show BREP ReFT outperforms both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures.

Conclusion: BREP ReFT effectively addresses ReFT's limitations in mathematical reasoning while maintaining parameter efficiency and demonstrating robust generalization.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient finetuning (PEFT) enhances model performance on downstream tasks by updating a minimal subset of parameters. Representation finetuning (ReFT) methods further improve efficiency by freezing model weights and optimizing internal representations with fewer parameters than PEFT, outperforming PEFT on several tasks. However, ReFT exhibits a significant performance decline on mathematical reasoning tasks. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates that ReFT's poor performance on mathematical tasks primarily stems from its struggle to generate effective reasoning prefixes during the early inference phase. Moreover, ReFT disturbs the numerical encoding and the error accumulats during the CoT stage. Based on these observations, this paper proposes Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT), which enhances ReFT's mathematical reasoning capability by truncating training data to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening on the early inference stage to prevent error accumulation, and constraining the intervention vectors' magnitude to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures demonstrate BREP's superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization capability, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on the task of mathematical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for generative models focus on distribution closeness but neglect uncertainty quantification in these measurements, which is crucial for reliability assessment.

Method: The paper discusses research directions including ensemble-based precision-recall curves and conducts preliminary experiments on synthetic datasets.

Result: Preliminary experiments show that aggregated precision-recall curves effectively capture model approximation uncertainty and enable systematic comparison of different model architectures based on uncertainty characteristics.

Conclusion: Uncertainty quantification is a fundamental but understudied aspect of generative models that requires formalization and new evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: While generative models have become increasingly prevalent across various domains, fundamental concerns regarding their reliability persist. A crucial yet understudied aspect of these models is the uncertainty quantification surrounding their distribution approximation capabilities. Current evaluation methodologies focus predominantly on measuring the closeness between the learned and the target distributions, neglecting the inherent uncertainty in these measurements. In this position paper, we formalize the problem of uncertainty quantification in generative model learning. We discuss potential research directions, including the use of ensemble-based precision-recall curves. Our preliminary experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of aggregated precision-recall curves in capturing model approximation uncertainty, enabling systematic comparison among different model architectures based on their uncertainty characteristics.

TL;DR: Automated FIM score estimation using deep learning with ST-GCN, BiLSTM, and attention mechanisms, achieving 70-79% accuracy in distinguishing independent vs assisted patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional FIM assessment imposes significant burden on patients and healthcare professionals, requiring automated solutions.

Method: Deep neural network combining spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN), bidirectional LSTM, and attention mechanism to estimate FIM motor scores from simple exercises.

Result: Achieved balanced accuracies of 70.09-78.79% across FIM items, successfully distinguishing independent patients from those requiring assistance.

Conclusion: The method effectively automates FIM assessment and reveals specific movement patterns as reliable predictors for FIM evaluation items.

Abstract: The functional independence measure (FIM) is widely used to evaluate patients' physical independence in activities of daily living. However, traditional FIM assessment imposes a significant burden on both patients and healthcare professionals. To address this challenge, we propose an automated FIM score estimation method that utilizes simple exercises different from the designated FIM assessment actions. Our approach employs a deep neural network architecture integrating a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and an attention mechanism to estimate FIM motor item scores. The model effectively captures long-term temporal dependencies and identifies key body-joint contributions through learned attention weights. We evaluated our method in a study of 277 rehabilitation patients, focusing on FIM transfer and locomotion items. Our approach successfully distinguishes between completely independent patients and those requiring assistance, achieving balanced accuracies of 70.09-78.79 % across different FIM items. Additionally, our analysis reveals specific movement patterns that serve as reliable predictors for particular FIM evaluation items.

*James Hazelden*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Matrix-free approach using trace estimation for fast computation of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) properties without full matrix computation, enabling orders of magnitude speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computing the full NTK matrix is often infeasible, especially for recurrent architectures, creating a need for efficient approximation methods.

Method: Uses trace estimation (Hutch++ estimator) and one-sided estimators that require only forward- or reverse-mode automatic differentiation, not both.

Result: Achieves speedups of many orders of magnitude in computing NTK trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment; one-sided estimators outperform Hutch++ in low-sample regimes.

Conclusion: Matrix-free randomized approaches enable faster analysis and applications of the NTK, particularly beneficial when there's a large gap between model state and parameter count.

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) characterizes how a model's state evolves over Gradient Descent. Computing the full NTK matrix is often infeasible, especially for recurrent architectures. Here, we introduce a matrix-free perspective, using trace estimation to rapidly analyze the empirical, finite-width NTK. This enables fast computation of the NTK's trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment. We provide numerical recipes based on the Hutch++ trace estimator with provably fast convergence guarantees. In addition, we show that, due to the structure of the NTK, one can compute the trace using only forward- or reverse-mode automatic differentiation, not requiring both modes. We show these so-called one-sided estimators can outperform Hutch++ in the low-sample regime, especially when the gap between the model state and parameter count is large. In total, our results demonstrate that matrix-free randomized approaches can yield speedups of many orders of magnitude, leading to faster analysis and applications of the NTK.

### [165] [Near-optimal Linear Predictive Clustering in Non-separable Spaces via Mixed Integer Programming and Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Reductions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10809)
*Jiazhou Liang,Hassan Khurram,Scott Sanner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces two novel global optimization approaches for Linear Predictive Clustering (LPC) that improve efficiency over existing methods, with provable error bounds and better scalability while achieving near-optimal solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for LPC have limitations: greedy optimization lacks global optimality and struggles with non-separable clusters, while Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) approaches ensure global optimality but suffer from poor scalability.

Method: Two novel approaches: 1) Near-optimal approximations leveraging separability properties with provable error bounds, reducing MIP complexity; 2) Approximation as Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) for computational improvements.

Result: Methods achieve near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization and superior scalability over existing MIP formulations, demonstrated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed constrained optimization approaches provide efficient global optimization for LPC with theoretical guarantees, addressing limitations of both greedy methods and traditional MIP formulations.

Abstract: Linear Predictive Clustering (LPC) partitions samples based on shared linear relationships between feature and target variables, with numerous applications including marketing, medicine, and education. Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings. Comparative analyses on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization while exhibiting superior scalability over existing MIP formulations.

### [166] [Transformers know more than they can tell -- Learning the Collatz sequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10811)
*François Charton,Ashvni Narayanan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers can predict long Collatz steps with high accuracy (up to 99.7%) depending on the encoding base, learning to classify inputs by their binary properties and loop lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers learn complex arithmetic functions like the Collatz sequence and use mathematical problems as tools for analyzing language model behavior.

Method: Train transformer models to predict long Collatz steps using different numerical bases for encoding inputs and outputs, then analyze learning patterns and failure cases.

Result: Accuracy varies significantly by base (99.7% for bases 24/32 vs 25-37% for bases 3/11). Models learn to classify inputs by residual modulo 2^p and achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes while struggling with others. Most errors occur from wrong loop length estimation rather than hallucinations.

Conclusion: The main challenge in learning complex arithmetic is determining the computation's control structure (loop lengths). Mathematical problems can effectively analyze and improve language model understanding.

Abstract: We investigate transformer prediction of long Collatz steps, a complex arithmetic function that maps odd integers to their distant successors in the Collatz sequence ( $u_{n+1}=u_n/2$ if $u_n$ is even, $u_{n+1}=(3u_n+1)/2$ if $u_n$ is odd). Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops. We believe that the approach outlined here, using mathematical problems as tools for understanding, explaining, and perhaps improving language models, can be applied to a broad range of problems and bear fruitful results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training neural operators for physical simulations is computationally expensive, and transfer learning via pretraining on simpler problems could reduce this cost.

Method: Use transformer-based neural operators in transfer learning settings, evaluating across diverse PDE problems including parameter extrapolation, new variable incorporation, and multi-equation dataset transfer.

Result: Advanced neural operator architectures successfully transfer knowledge across different PDE problems.

Conclusion: Transformer-based neural operators are effective for transfer learning in PDE problems, enabling knowledge transfer across diverse physical simulation scenarios.

Abstract: Although neural operators are widely used in data-driven physical simulations, their training remains computationally expensive. Recent advances address this issue via downstream learning, where a model pretrained on simpler problems is fine-tuned on more complex ones. In this research, we investigate transformer-based neural operators, which have previously been applied only to specific problems, in a more general transfer learning setting. We evaluate their performance across diverse PDE problems, including extrapolation to unseen parameters, incorporation of new variables, and transfer from multi-equation datasets. Our results demonstrate that advanced neural operator architectures can effectively transfer knowledge across PDE problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quantum kernel research is limited to low-dimensional or synthetic data, lacking evaluation on diverse real-world datasets to verify practical quantum advantage.

Method: Developed a variational quantum kernel framework with resource-efficient ansätze and parameter scaling technique for complex classification tasks, benchmarked on 8 challenging real-world datasets.

Result: The proposed quantum kernel demonstrated clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels (RBF) across tabular, image, time series, and graph data in classical simulations.

Conclusion: Properly designed quantum kernels can serve as versatile, high-performance tools for real-world machine learning, though further research is needed to fully assess practical quantum advantage.

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are a promising branch of quantum machine learning, yet their practical advantage on diverse, high-dimensional, real-world data remains unverified. Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed a variational quantum kernel framework utilizing resource-efficient ansätze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our classically simulated results show that the proposed quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical quantum advantage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SurfaceBench is a comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery with 183 tasks across 15 complexity categories, featuring explicit, implicit, and parametric equation forms with 3D data and geometry-aware evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symbolic regression benchmarks are limited to scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, rely on brittle string-matching metrics, and are vulnerable to LLM memorization, failing to capture scientific equivalence and geometric reconstruction.

Method: Created 183 surface discovery tasks with novel symbolic compositions to resist memorization, including ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetic 3D data across scientific domains like fluid dynamics, robotics, and geometry.

Result: State-of-the-art frameworks struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities, showing limited performance despite occasional success on specific equation families.

Conclusion: SurfaceBench provides a challenging testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling better benchmarking of compositional generalization, scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench

TL;DR: EarthSight is a distributed runtime framework that enables satellite constellations to perform efficient, low-latency image analysis by coordinating onboard multi-task inference with ground-station query scheduling and dynamic filter ordering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional satellite image delivery pipelines suffer from hours to days of delay due to bandwidth limitations, while existing onboard ML solutions treat satellites as isolated nodes, leading to redundant inference and inefficient resource usage.

Method: Three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones, (2) ground-station query scheduler that aggregates requests and assigns compute budgets, (3) dynamic filter ordering that integrates model selectivity, accuracy and cost to reject low-value images early.

Result: EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile end-to-end latency from 51 to 21 minutes compared to state-of-the-art baseline.

Conclusion: EarthSight enables satellite constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets by leveraging global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit.

Abstract: Low-latency delivery of satellite imagery is essential for time-critical applications such as disaster response, intelligence, and infrastructure monitoring. However, traditional pipelines rely on downlinking all captured images before analysis, introducing delays of hours to days due to restricted communication bandwidth. To address these bottlenecks, emerging systems perform onboard machine learning to prioritize which images to transmit. However, these solutions typically treat each satellite as an isolated compute node, limiting scalability and efficiency. Redundant inference across satellites and tasks further strains onboard power and compute costs, constraining mission scope and responsiveness. We present EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a distributed decision problem between orbit and ground. EarthSight introduces three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones to amortize computation across multiple vision tasks; (2) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts priorities, and assigns compute budgets to incoming imagery; and (3) dynamic filter ordering, which integrates model selectivity, accuracy, and execution cost to reject low-value images early and conserve resources. EarthSight leverages global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit to enable constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets. Evaluations using a prior established satellite simulator show that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile end-to-end latency from first contact to delivery from 51 to 21 minutes compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.

*Elyes Hajji,Aymen Bouguerra,Fabio Arnez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for evaluating hallucination detection in LLMs, distinguishing between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations, and proposes attention-based methods that outperform sampling-based approaches for intrinsic hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in safety-critical applications but remain prone to hallucinations, with existing detection methods being computationally expensive and failing to distinguish between different hallucination types.

Method: The authors propose a principled evaluation framework that differentiates extrinsic vs intrinsic hallucinations, and introduce novel attention aggregation strategies based on attention-based uncertainty quantification for improved detection.

Result: Sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy work well for extrinsic hallucinations but fail on intrinsic ones, while the proposed attention aggregation method is better suited for detecting intrinsic hallucinations.

Conclusion: Attention serves as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty, and aligning detection strategies with hallucination types provides new directions for improving hallucination detection in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet remain susceptible to hallucinations. While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations. These insights provide new directions for aligning detection strategies with the nature of hallucination and highlight attention as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowPath improves neural controlled differential equations by learning data-adaptive control paths using invertible neural flows, achieving better performance on irregular time series compared to fixed interpolation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for modeling continuous-time dynamics from sparse time series use fixed interpolation schemes with simplistic geometric assumptions that misrepresent the underlying data manifold, especially under high missingness.

Method: Proposes FlowPath, which learns the geometry of control paths via invertible neural flows that construct continuous, data-adaptive manifolds with information-preserving transformations.

Result: Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and real-world case studies show statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures.

Conclusion: Modeling both the dynamics along the path and the geometry of the path itself provides a robust and generalizable solution for learning from irregular time series.

Abstract: Modeling continuous-time dynamics from sparse and irregularly-sampled time series remains a fundamental challenge. Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures. These results highlight the importance of modeling not only the dynamics along the path but also the geometry of the path itself, offering a robust and generalizable solution for learning from irregular time series.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional muscle activation estimation methods are computationally expensive and lack high-quality labeled datasets for multi-joint applications.

Method: Proposes PI-MJCA-BiGRU framework with Multi-Joint Cross-Attention module and BiGRU layers to capture inter-joint coordination, embedding physics constraints in loss function.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to supervised methods without ground-truth labels, with MJCA module significantly enhancing inter-joint coordination modeling.

Conclusion: The framework enables time-efficient, physiologically consistent muscle activation and force estimation directly from kinematics without requiring labeled data.

Abstract: Time-efficient estimation of muscle activations and forces across multi-joint systems is critical for clinical assessment and assistive device control. However, conventional approaches are computationally expensive and lack a high-quality labeled dataset for multi-joint applications. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematics. The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.

### [174] [Behaviour Policy Optimization: Provably Lower Variance Return Estimates for Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10843)
*Alexander W. Goodall,Edwin Hamel-De le Court,Francesco Belardinelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve sample efficiency and training stability in RL by using well-designed behavior policies for lower-variance return estimates, extending off-policy evaluation insights to online RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many RL algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency and training instability due to high-variance return estimates. Recent off-policy evaluation results show that properly designed behavior policies can provide provably lower-variance return estimates.

Method: Extend off-policy evaluation insights to online RL by using a single behavior policy to collect data with lower-variance return estimates. Apply this regime to policy-gradient methods.

Result: Experiments show improved sample efficiency and performance across diverse environments when extending two policy-gradient methods with this approach.

Conclusion: Using well-designed behavior policies for data collection can provide provably lower-variance return estimates, leading to better sample efficiency and performance in online reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on return estimates for policy improvement, can suffer from poor sample efficiency and training instability due to high-variance return estimates. In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.

*Brad Shook,Abby Turner,Jieshi Chen,Michał Wiliński,Mononito Goswami,Jonathan Elmer,Artur Dubrawski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces STAMP, a lightweight spatial-temporal adapter that enables general time series foundation models to perform comparably to EEG-specific foundation models on EEG classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While EEG-specific foundation models exist, there's no comparative analysis between them and general time series foundation models on EEG tasks. The authors aim to bridge this gap and demonstrate that general TSFMs can be effectively adapted for EEG data.

Method: Proposed STAMP (Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling) that leverages univariate embeddings from general TSFMs and implicitly models spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG data through a lightweight adapter architecture.

Result: STAMP achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEG-specific foundation models across 8 benchmark EEG classification datasets, while being lightweight in trainable parameters and flexible in input handling.

Conclusion: General time series foundation models can be effectively adapted for EEG data using lightweight adapters like STAMP, achieving competitive performance without requiring specialized EEG foundation models.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) pretrained on data from multiple domains have shown strong performance on diverse modeling tasks. Various efforts have been made to develop foundation models specific to electroencephalography (EEG) data, which records brain electrical activity as time series. However, no comparative analysis of EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) versus general TSFMs has been performed on EEG-specific tasks. We introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling (STAMP), which leverages univariate embeddings produced by a general TSFM, implicitly models spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG data, and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEGFMs. A comprehensive analysis is performed on 8 benchmark datasets of clinical tasks using EEG for classification, along with ablation studies. Our proposed adapter is lightweight in trainable parameters and flexible in the inputs it can accommodate, supporting easy modeling of EEG data using TSFMs.

*Tom Yuviler,Dana Drachsler-Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExPairT-LLM is an exact learning algorithm for code selection that uses pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence queries to LLMs, improving code generation success rates by up to 27.1% over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code selection algorithms fail because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or rely on LLMs that don't always correctly determine outputs for every input.

Method: Uses pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence queries to LLM oracles, which are simpler for LLMs, and identifies correct programs through a tournament structure that is robust to some LLM mistakes.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art code selection algorithm by +13.0% on average and up to +27.1% in pass@1 on four popular code datasets. Also improves pass@1 of LLMs performing complex reasoning by +24.0%.

Conclusion: ExPairT-LLM's approach of using simpler pairwise queries enables more reliable code selection and significantly improves code generation success rates.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in LLMs, the task of code generation is still challenging. To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence. These queries are simpler for LLMs and enable ExPairT-LLM to identify the correct program through a tournament, which is robust to some LLM mistakes. We evaluate ExPairT-LLM on four popular code datasets. Its pass@1 (success rate) outperforms the state-of-the-art code selection algorithm on average by +13.0% and up to +27.1%. It also improves the pass@1 of LLMs performing complex reasoning by +24.0%.

*Xuchen Gong,Tian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAZO uses public data to improve gradient approximation in private zeroth-order optimization, achieving better privacy/utility tradeoffs than first-order methods with up to 16x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: First-order DP methods like DP-SGD have high computation/memory costs. Zeroth-order methods are easier to privatize but suffer from lower utility compared to DP-SGD.

Method: Proposed PAZO framework that leverages public information to guide and improve gradient approximation in private zeroth-order algorithms with minimal overhead.

Result: PAZO achieves superior privacy/utility tradeoffs across vision and text tasks in both pre-training and fine-tuning, outperforming first-order baselines especially in highly private regimes with up to 16x runtime speedup.

Conclusion: Public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimization provides an effective approach for private machine learning with better performance and efficiency than existing methods.

Abstract: One of the major bottlenecks for deploying popular first-order differentially private (DP) machine learning algorithms (e.g., DP-SGD) lies in their high computation and memory cost, despite the existence of optimized implementations. Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms. We explore a suite of public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizers (PAZO) with minimal overhead. We provide theoretical analyses of the PAZO framework under an assumption of the similarity between public and private data. Empirically, we demonstrate that PAZO achieves superior privacy/utility tradeoffs across vision and text tasks in both pre-training and fine-tuning settings, outperforming the best first-order baselines (with public data) especially in highly private regimes, while offering up to $16\times$ runtime speedup.

Conclusion: GO UT Bench effectively addresses the training data imbalance problem for code LLMs, particularly for unit test generation in Golang, with fine-tuned models showing significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Training data imbalance poses a major challenge for code LLMs. Most available data heavily over represents raw opensource code while underrepresenting broader software engineering tasks, especially in low resource languages like Golang. As a result, models excel at code autocompletion but struggle with real world developer workflows such as unit test generation. To address this gap, we introduce GO UT Bench, a benchmark dataset of 5264 pairs of code and unit tests, drawn from 10 permissively licensed Golang repositories spanning diverse domain. We evaluate its effectiveness as a fine tuning dataset across two LLM families i.e. mixture of experts and dense decoders. Our results show that finetuned models outperform their base counterparts on more than 75% of benchmark tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes G4RL, a graph encoder-decoder method that enhances Goal-conditioned Hierarchical RL by generating subgoal representations for unseen states, improving performance in symmetric and reversible transition environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based GCHRL methods rely on domain-specific knowledge for graph construction or struggle to utilize dynamically created graphs effectively, facing issues with sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation.

Method: Develops a graph encoder-decoder trained on state graphs generated during exploration to evaluate unseen states, which can be integrated into any existing GCHRL method for environments with symmetric and reversible transitions.

Result: Empirical results show significant performance enhancement in state-of-the-art GCHRL approaches with minimal computational overhead in both dense and sparse reward environments.

Conclusion: G4RL effectively addresses key challenges in GCHRL by leveraging graph encoder-decoder for subgoal representation generation, demonstrating improved performance across various environments.

Abstract: The integration of graphs with Goal-conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GCHRL) has recently gained attention, as intermediate goals (subgoals) can be effectively sampled from graphs that naturally represent the overall task structure in most RL tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration. Empirical results indicate that leveraging high and low-level intrinsic rewards from the graph encoder-decoder significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art GCHRL approaches with an extra small computational cost in dense and sparse reward environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural disasters cause large-scale power outages with significant economic and societal impacts. Accurate prediction of outage recovery is crucial for power grid resilience, but faces challenges with spatial dependency, spatial heterogeneity, and limited event data.

Method: Uses Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with unsupervised pre-training followed by semi-supervised learning. Applied to field data from four major hurricanes affecting 501 counties across eight Southeastern U.S. states.

Result: Model achieves >93% accuracy and outperforms XGBoost, Random Forest, GCN, and simple GAT by 2-15% in both overall performance and class-wise accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed GAT approach effectively addresses spatial dependency and heterogeneity challenges in power outage prediction, demonstrating superior performance for resilience planning in power grids affected by severe weather events.

Abstract: Natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and winter storms have induced large-scale power outages in the U.S., resulting in tremendous economic and societal impacts. Accurately predicting power outage recovery and impact is key to resilience of power grid. Recent advances in machine learning offer viable frameworks for estimating power outage duration from geospatial and weather data. However, three major challenges are inherent to the task in a real world setting: spatial dependency of the data, spatial heterogeneity of the impact, and moderate event data. We propose a novel approach to estimate the duration of severe weather-induced power outages through Graph Attention Networks (GAT). Our network uses a simple structure from unsupervised pre-training, followed by semi-supervised learning. We use field data from four major hurricanes affecting $501$ counties in eight Southeastern U.S. states. The model exhibits an excellent performance ($>93\%$ accuracy) and outperforms the existing methods XGBoost, Random Forest, GCN and simple GAT by $2\% - 15\%$ in both the overall performance and class-wise accuracy.

*Guanxiong He,Jie Wang,Liaoyuan Tang,Zheng Wang,Rong Wang,Feiping Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPP-FGC is a federated clustering method that uses local structural graphs for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, avoiding the performance-privacy trade-off of existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current federated clustering methods face a dilemma: transmitting embeddings risks data leakage, while sharing only cluster prototypes reduces accuracy. There's a need for better privacy-preserving techniques.

Method: Client-server framework where clients build private structural graphs capturing data relationships. Server securely aggregates and aligns these into a global graph for clustering. Two modes: one-shot SPP-FGC for efficiency, and iterative SPP-FGC+ for complex data like images.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 10% improvement in clustering accuracy (NMI) over federated baselines while maintaining provable privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: SPP-FGC successfully resolves the performance-privacy trade-off in federated clustering through structural graph-based knowledge sharing, offering both efficient and high-performance variants for different data types.

Abstract: Federated clustering addresses the critical challenge of extracting patterns from decentralized, unlabeled data. However, it is hampered by the flaw that current approaches are forced to accept a compromise between performance and privacy: \textit{transmitting embedding representations risks sensitive data leakage, while sharing only abstract cluster prototypes leads to diminished model accuracy}. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework offers two distinct modes to suit different needs. SPP-FGC is designed as an efficient one-shot method that completes its task in a single communication round, ideal for rapid analysis. For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving clustering accuracy by up to 10\% (NMI) over federated baselines while maintaining provable privacy guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphToxin is the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning that can recover deleted nodes and their connections, undermining privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph unlearning is vulnerable to attacks that can recover supposedly erased data, creating privacy risks despite regulatory compliance efforts.

Method: Uses a novel curvature matching module for fine-grained guidance to recover full unlearned graphs, works in both white-box and black-box settings for multiple node removals.

Result: Successfully recovers deleted individuals' information, personal links, and sensitive content from connections; existing defenses are largely ineffective and can sometimes amplify the attack.

Conclusion: GraphToxin reveals severe privacy vulnerabilities in graph unlearning, highlighting the urgent need for more robust defense strategies against reconstruction attacks.

Abstract: Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with "the right to be forgotten" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of edge inference where each arm represents an inference model with accuracy and error probability, requiring efficient decision-making under uncertainty.

Method: Theoretical analysis of four bandit policies: Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling in cascade bandit model for edge inference.

Result: LCB and Thompson Sampling achieve constant O(1) regret by continuously adapting decisions, while Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret due to fixed ordering after exploration phase.

Conclusion: Adaptivity is crucial for efficient edge inference under uncertainty, with LCB and Thompson Sampling outperforming non-adaptive policies through continuous feedback-based decision updates.

Abstract: Motivated by the challenges of edge inference, we study a variant of the cascade bandit model in which each arm corresponds to an inference model with an associated accuracy and error probability. We analyse four decision-making policies-Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling-and provide sharp theoretical regret guarantees for each. Unlike in classical bandit settings, Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret because they commit to a fixed ordering after the exploration phase, limiting their ability to adapt. In contrast, LCB and Thompson Sampling continuously update their decisions based on observed feedback, achieving constant O(1) regret. Simulations corroborate these theoretical findings, highlighting the crucial role of adaptivity for efficient edge inference under uncertainty.

TL;DR: Proposes a flow matching (FM)-based generative model for MIMO channel estimation that significantly reduces sampling overhead compared to diffusion model-based approaches while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion model-based channel estimation suffers from slow sampling speed, which limits practical deployment despite showing potential for high-precision CSI acquisition.

Method: Formulates channel estimation within FM framework with straight-line trajectory evolution, derives velocity field dependent on noise statistics for training, and uses trained velocity field as prior information with ODE Euler solver for fast sampling.

Result: Significantly reduces sampling overhead compared to diffusion model-based schemes while achieving superior channel estimation accuracy under different channel conditions.

Conclusion: FM-based channel estimation provides a fast and reliable alternative to DM-based approaches, enabling quick noise channel enhancement with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Diffusion model (DM)-based channel estimation, which generates channel samples via a posteriori sampling stepwise with denoising process, has shown potential in high-precision channel state information (CSI) acquisition. However, slow sampling speed is an essential challenge for recent developed DM-based schemes. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel flow matching (FM)-based generative model for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation. We first formulate the channel estimation problem within FM framework, where the conditional probability path is constructed from the noisy channel distribution to the true channel distribution. In this case, the path evolves along the straight-line trajectory at a constant speed. Then, guided by this, we derive the velocity field that depends solely on the noise statistics to guide generative models training. Furthermore, during the sampling phase, we utilize the trained velocity field as prior information for channel estimation, which allows for quick and reliable noise channel enhancement via ordinary differential equation (ODE) Euler solver. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FM-based channel estimation scheme can significantly reduce the sampling overhead compared to other popular DM-based schemes, such as the score matching (SM)-based scheme. Meanwhile, it achieves superior channel estimation accuracy under different channel conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in model merging from parameter interference and enable explicit balance of performance trade-offs through controllable merging, overcoming limitations of existing compile-then-query approaches with exponential complexity growth.

Method: Shifts from parameter-space optimization to direct correction of model's final representation, modeling correction as optimal linear transformation with closed-form solution that is architecture-agnostic and incorporates user preferences.

Result: Generates superior Pareto front with more precise preference alignment and drastically reduced computational cost compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables efficient on-the-fly generation of Pareto-optimal models with linear complexity scaling, overcoming limitations of traditional model merging approaches.

Abstract: Model merging combines expert models for multitask performance but faces challenges from parameter interference. This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks. Experimental results show our method generates a superior Pareto front with more precise preference alignment and drastically reduced computational cost.

*Fuxiang Huang,Xiaowei Fu,Shiyu Ye,Lina Ma,Wen Li,Xinbo Gao,David Zhang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces URDA (Unsupervised Robust Domain Adaptation), a new paradigm that addresses both domain adaptation and adversarial robustness. It proposes DART (Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training), a simple two-step method that first pre-trains any UDA model and then applies robustification via disentangled distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most UDA approaches focus on transfer ability but overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves robustness but fails in UDA paradigms, creating a need for methods that address both domain shift and adversarial noise.

Method: The paper proposes the URDA paradigm and introduces DART algorithm - a two-step training procedure: 1) Pre-train any UDA model, 2) Apply instantaneous robustification post-training via disentangled distillation to ensure both transferability and robustness.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability. The method validates the proposed URDA paradigm and theory.

Conclusion: This is the first work to establish the URDA paradigm and theory, successfully addressing the inherent entanglement challenge in UDA+VAT approaches. DART provides a simple yet effective solution for robust domain adaptation without complex modifications.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain by addressing domain shifts. Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.

### [189] [Enhancing Graph Representations with Neighborhood-Contextualized Message-Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11046)
*Brian Godwin Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework to enhance GNN expressivity by incorporating broader local neighborhood context, demonstrated through SINC-GCN architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard message-passing GNNs only consider pairwise node features, failing to capture rich contextual information from the broader neighborhood, which limits their ability to learn complex relationships.

Method: Formalizes neighborhood-contextualization concept, generalizes message-passing to NCMP framework, and develops SINC-GCN as a practical implementation with efficient parametrization.

Result: Preliminary analysis on synthetic binary node classification shows improved expressivity and efficiency compared to standard approaches.

Conclusion: NCMP framework provides a practical path to enhance graph representational power of classical GNNs by incorporating neighborhood context.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become an indispensable tool for analyzing relational data. In the literature, classical GNNs may be classified into three variants: convolutional, attentional, and message-passing. While the standard message-passing variant is highly expressive, its typical pair-wise messages nevertheless only consider the features of the center node and each neighboring node individually. This design fails to incorporate the rich contextual information contained within the broader local neighborhood, potentially hindering its ability to learn complex relationships within the entire set of neighboring nodes. To address this limitation, this work first formalizes the concept of neighborhood-contextualization, rooted in a key property of the attentional variant. This then serves as the foundation for generalizing the message-passing variant to the proposed neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework. To demonstrate its utility, a simple, practical, and efficient method to parametrize and operationalize NCMP is presented, leading to the development of the proposed Soft-Isomorphic Neighborhood-Contextualized Graph Convolution Network (SINC-GCN). A preliminary analysis on a synthetic binary node classification problem then underscores both the expressivity and efficiency of the proposed GNN architecture. Overall, the paper lays the foundation for the novel NCMP framework as a practical path toward further enhancing the graph representational power of classical GNNs.

*Jun Hu,Shangheng Chen,Yufei He,Yuan Li,Bryan Hooi,Bingsheng He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Echoless-LP eliminates training label leakage in pre-computation-based HGNNs using partition-focused echoless propagation, achieving superior performance while maintaining memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pre-computation HGNNs suffer from training label leakage (echo effect) where node labels propagate back to themselves during multi-hop message passing, and current mitigation strategies are memory-inefficient or incompatible with advanced methods.

Method: Proposes Echoless-LP with Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP) that partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation where nodes collect label information only from neighbors in other partitions. Also introduces Asymmetric Partitioning Scheme (APS) and PostAdjust mechanism.

Result: Experiments on public datasets show Echoless-LP achieves superior performance and maintains memory efficiency compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Echoless-LP effectively eliminates training label leakage while remaining memory-efficient and compatible with any message passing method, addressing key limitations of existing pre-computation HGNN approaches.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are widely used for deep learning on heterogeneous graphs. Typical end-to-end HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Pre-computation-based HGNNs address this by performing message passing only once during preprocessing, collecting neighbor information into regular-shaped tensors, which enables efficient mini-batch training. Label-based pre-computation methods collect neighbors' label information but suffer from training label leakage, where a node's own label information propagates back to itself during multi-hop message passing - the echo effect. Existing mitigation strategies are memory-inefficient on large graphs or suffer from compatibility issues with advanced message passing methods. We propose Echoless Label-based Pre-computation (Echoless-LP), which eliminates training label leakage with Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP). PFEP partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation, where nodes in each partition collect label information only from neighbors in other partitions, avoiding echo while remaining memory-efficient and compatible with any message passing method. We also introduce an Asymmetric Partitioning Scheme (APS) and a PostAdjust mechanism to address information loss from partitioning and distributional shifts across partitions. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that Echoless-LP achieves superior performance and maintains memory efficiency compared to baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaPT is a scalable population training framework for zero-shot coordination that uses parameter sharing and mutual information regularization to efficiently train large populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing population-based methods for zero-shot coordination are limited by computational resources and focus on small populations, missing performance gains from scaling population size.

Method: Proposes ScaPT with two components: a meta-agent that efficiently realizes populations through selective parameter sharing, and a mutual information regularizer that ensures population diversity.

Result: Empirical evaluation in Hanabi shows ScaPT outperforms representative frameworks, confirming its effectiveness for zero-shot coordination.

Conclusion: ScaPT provides an efficient and scalable solution for zero-shot coordination by enabling large population training while maintaining diversity through mutual information regularization.

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination(ZSC) has become a hot topic in reinforcement learning research recently. It focuses on the generalization ability of agents, requiring them to coordinate well with collaborators that are not seen before without any fine-tuning. Population-based training has been proven to provide good zero-shot coordination performance; nevertheless, existing methods are limited by computational resources, mainly focusing on optimizing diversity in small populations while neglecting the potential performance gains from scaling population size. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Scalable Population Training (ScaPT), an efficient training framework comprising two key components: a meta-agent that efficiently realizes a population by selectively sharing parameters across agents, and a mutual information regularizer that guarantees population diversity. To empirically validate the effectiveness of ScaPT, this paper evaluates it along with representational frameworks in Hanabi and confirms its superiority.

### [192] [Sheaf Cohomology of Linear Predictive Coding Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11092)
*Jeffrey Seely*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Predictive coding networks can be modeled as cellular sheaves, where sheaf cohomology reveals irreducible error patterns and Hodge decomposition identifies when feedback loops cause learning to stall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why recurrent predictive coding networks sometimes fail to learn, by identifying irreducible error patterns and internal contradictions caused by feedback loops.

Method: Model linear predictive coding networks as cellular sheaves, use sheaf cohomology to characterize irreducible errors, and apply Hodge decomposition to analyze feedback-induced contradictions.

Result: The sheaf formalism identifies problematic network configurations where feedback loops create internal contradictions that cannot be resolved through inference, causing learning to stall.

Conclusion: Cellular sheaves provide both diagnostic tools for identifying problematic recurrent network configurations and design principles for effective weight initialization in predictive coding networks.

Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) replaces global backpropagation with local optimization over weights and activations. We show that linear PC networks admit a natural formulation as cellular sheaves: the sheaf coboundary maps activations to edge-wise prediction errors, and PC inference is diffusion under the sheaf Laplacian. Sheaf cohomology then characterizes irreducible error patterns that inference cannot remove. We analyze recurrent topologies where feedback loops create internal contradictions, introducing prediction errors unrelated to supervision. Using a Hodge decomposition, we determine when these contradictions cause learning to stall. The sheaf formalism provides both diagnostic tools for identifying problematic network configurations and design principles for effective weight initialization for recurrent PC networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address workload interference in Dragonfly networks where traditional PDES is computationally expensive for large-scale or real-time scenarios.

Method: Combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) to capture spatial and temporal patterns from port-level router data.

Result: Outperforms existing statistical and machine learning baselines in runtime prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Enables efficient hybrid simulation of Dragonfly networks for accurate runtime forecasting.

Abstract: The Dragonfly network, with its high-radix and low-diameter structure, is a leading interconnect in high-performance computing. A major challenge is workload interference on shared network links. Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) is commonly used to analyze workload interference. However, high-fidelity PDES is computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale or real-time scenarios. Hybrid simulation that incorporates data-driven surrogate models offers a promising alternative, especially for forecasting application runtime, a task complicated by the dynamic behavior of network traffic. We present \ourmodel, a surrogate model that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) to capture both spatial and temporal patterns from port level router data. \ourmodel outperforms existing statistical and machine learning baselines, enabling accurate runtime prediction and supporting efficient hybrid simulation of Dragonfly networks.

### [194] [Improving Continual Learning of Knowledge Graph Embeddings via Informed Initialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11118)
*Gerard Pons,Besim Bilalli,Anna Queralt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel embedding initialization strategy for continual learning in Knowledge Graph Embeddings that uses KG schema and existing embeddings to initialize new entities, improving performance and reducing training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge Graphs are frequently updated, requiring KGEs to adapt to changes. Current continual learning methods need effective initialization strategies for new entities to improve accuracy and reduce training time, especially for small frequent updates.

Method: Utilizes KG schema and previously learned embeddings to obtain initial representations for new entities based on their classes, which can be integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE.

Result: Improves predictive performance of KGEs, enhances knowledge retention, accelerates knowledge acquisition by reducing training epochs and time, and shows benefits across various KGE learning models.

Conclusion: The proposed informed embedding initialization strategy effectively enhances continual learning for KGEs by improving performance, reducing forgetting, and accelerating training across different model types.

Abstract: Many Knowledege Graphs (KGs) are frequently updated, forcing their Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) to adapt to these changes. To address this problem, continual learning techniques for KGEs incorporate embeddings for new entities while updating the old ones. One necessary step in these methods is the initialization of the embeddings, as an input to the KGE learning process, which can have an important impact in the accuracy of the final embeddings, as well as in the time required to train them. This is especially relevant for relatively small and frequent updates. We propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE, that enhances the acquisition of new knowledge while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the KG schema and the previously learned embeddings are utilized to obtain initial representations for the new entities, based on the classes the entities belong to. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed initialization strategy improves the predictive performance of the resulting KGEs, while also enhancing knowledge retention. Furthermore, our approach accelerates knowledge acquisition, reducing the number of epochs, and therefore time, required to incrementally learn new embeddings. Finally, its benefits across various types of KGE learning models are demonstrated.

Motivation: Detecting point anomalies in bank account balances is essential for identifying fraud and operational issues, but existing robust statistical methods are often inefficient and computationally expensive in high-dimensional settings.

Method: Several robust approaches designed for medium and high-dimensional datasets with high breakdown points and low computational time.

Result: Methods were empirically evaluated on approximately 2.6 million daily records of anonymous users' bank account balances.

Conclusion: The proposed robust approaches offer computational efficiency while maintaining high breakdown points for anomaly detection in financial data.

Abstract: Detecting point anomalies in bank account balances is essential for financial institutions, as it enables the identification of potential fraud, operational issues, or other irregularities. Robust statistics is useful for flagging outliers and for providing estimates of the data distribution parameters that are not affected by contaminated observations. However, such a strategy is often less efficient and computationally expensive under high dimensional setting. In this paper, we propose and evaluate empirically several robust approaches that may be computationally efficient in medium and high dimensional datasets, with high breakdown points and low computational time. Our application deals with around 2.6 million daily records of anonymous users' bank account balances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance transparency in precipitation forecasting models while maintaining accuracy, addressing the black-box nature of deep learning models that limits real-world adoption.

Method: Hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM architecture trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data, optimized with different convolutional filters for each city (Bengaluru:32, Mumbai/Delhi:64, Kolkata:128), with interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Grad-CAM, temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation.

Result: Achieved RMSE values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata), with prediction horizons ranging from 1 day for Bengaluru to 5 days for Kolkata.

Conclusion: Demonstrates how explainable AI can provide both accurate forecasts and transparent insights into precipitation patterns across diverse urban environments, with models relying on city-specific variables.

Abstract: Deep learning models for precipitation forecasting often function as black boxes, limiting their adoption in real-world weather prediction. To enhance transparency while maintaining accuracy, we developed an interpretable deep learning framework for short-term precipitation prediction in four major Indian cities: Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, spanning diverse climate zones. We implemented a hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data. The architecture was optimized for each city with a different number of convolutional filters: Bengaluru (32), Mumbai and Delhi (64), and Kolkata (128). The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata. This study demonstrates how explainable AI (xAI) can provide accurate forecasts and transparent insights into precipitation patterns in diverse urban environments.

*Omri Ben-Dov,Luiz F. O. Chamon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method to minimize Jeffreys divergence by using a proxy model that jointly trains with the main model to overcome limitations of asymmetric divergences like forward KL and challenges with symmetric alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for learning probability distributions often use asymmetric divergences (forward KL) or brittle min-max formulations (GANs). The symmetric Jeffreys divergence is challenging to compute from samples, motivating a new practical approach.

Method: Uses a proxy model that jointly trains with the main model to minimize Jeffreys divergence, formulated as a constrained optimization problem that adapts model priorities throughout training.

Result: The framework enables combining advantages of normalizing flows and energy-based models for tasks like density estimation, image generation, and simulation-based inference.

Conclusion: The proposed joint training approach provides a practical method to minimize Jeffreys divergence, overcoming limitations of existing divergence minimization techniques.

Abstract: Many tasks in machine learning can be described as or reduced to learning a probability distribution given a finite set of samples. A common approach is to minimize a statistical divergence between the (empirical) data distribution and a parameterized distribution, e.g., a normalizing flow (NF) or an energy-based model (EBM). In this context, the forward KL divergence is a ubiquitous due to its tractability, though its asymmetry may prevent capturing some properties of the target distribution. Symmetric alternatives involve brittle min-max formulations and adversarial training (e.g., generative adversarial networks) or evaluating the reverse KL divergence, as is the case for the symmetric Jeffreys divergence, which is challenging to compute from samples. This work sets out to develop a new approach to minimize the Jeffreys divergence. To do so, it uses a proxy model whose goal is not only to fit the data, but also to assist in optimizing the Jeffreys divergence of the main model. This joint training task is formulated as a constrained optimization problem to obtain a practical algorithm that adapts the models priorities throughout training. We illustrate how this framework can be used to combine the advantages of NFs and EBMs in tasks such as density estimation, image generation, and simulation-based inference.

Motivation: To improve predictions of climate extreme events, specifically heat waves, using machine learning methods by addressing the challenge of accurate extreme weather forecasting.

Method: Framed as classification problem predicting if surface air temperature exceeds local quantiles; applied power mean aggregation to ensemble predictions from a generative ML weather forecasting model.

Result: Power mean aggregation significantly enhances classifier performance, achieving better accuracy than typical mean prediction, with optimal performance varying by quantile threshold and increased effectiveness for higher extremes.

Conclusion: Power aggregation method shows promise for extreme heat event prediction, demonstrating adaptability and improved performance over traditional ensemble averaging, particularly for more extreme thresholds.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of improving predictions of climate extreme events, specifically heat waves, using machine learning methods. Our work is framed as a classification problem in which we try to predict whether surface air temperature will exceed its q-th local quantile within a specified timeframe. Our key finding is that aggregating ensemble predictions using a power mean significantly enhances the classifier's performance. By making a machine-learning based weather forecasting model generative and applying this non-linear aggregation method, we achieve better accuracy in predicting extreme heat events than with the typical mean prediction from the same model. Our power aggregation method shows promise and adaptability, as its optimal performance varies with the quantile threshold chosen, demonstrating increased effectiveness for higher extremes prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time learning of governing equations from data for physical systems with time-varying parameters, which existing methods like SINDy alone cannot handle effectively.

Method: Integrates SINDy algorithm with Kalman filter by treating unknown system parameters as state variables, allowing real-time inference of complex nonlinear models with time-varying parameters.

Result: SKF successfully identifies chaotic Lorenz systems with drifting/switching parameters and provides real-time identification of sparse nonlinear aircraft models from real flight data.

Conclusion: SKF unifies sparse modeling and control theory approaches, enabling real-time learning of time-varying nonlinear systems and simplifying parameter estimation tasks like sparsity levels and switching instants.

Abstract: Learning governing equations from data is central to understanding the behavior of physical systems across diverse scientific disciplines, including physics, biology, and engineering. The Sindy algorithm has proven effective in leveraging sparsity to identify concise models of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we extend sparsity-driven approaches to real-time learning by integrating a cornerstone algorithm from control theory -- the Kalman filter (KF). The resulting Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF) unifies both frameworks by treating unknown system parameters as state variables, enabling real-time inference of complex, time-varying nonlinear models unattainable by either method alone. Furthermore, SKF enhances KF parameter identification strategies, particularly via look-ahead error, significantly simplifying the estimation of sparsity levels, variance parameters, and switching instants. We validate SKF on a chaotic Lorenz system with drifting or switching parameters and demonstrate its effectiveness in the real-time identification of a sparse nonlinear aircraft model built from real flight data.

TL;DR: DGIMVCM is a novel incomplete multi-view clustering method that uses dynamic deep graph learning with masked graph reconstruction loss to address noise in graph construction and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-view data often has missing views, and existing GNN-based methods suffer from noise in static KNN graphs and gradient noise from MSE loss in graph reconstruction.

Method: Constructs missing-robust global graph, uses graph convolutional embedding for dynamic view-specific graphs and imputation, employs graph structure contrastive learning, and optimizes with masked graph reconstruction loss and pseudo-label self-supervised training.

Result: Extensive experiments show DGIMVCM achieves superior performance compared to existing methods on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DGIMVCM effectively addresses noise issues in incomplete multi-view clustering through dynamic graph learning and masked reconstruction loss, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The prevalence of real-world multi-view data makes incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) a crucial research. The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel \textbf{D}ynamic Deep \textbf{G}raph Learning for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{C}lustering with \textbf{M}asked Graph Reconstruction Loss (DGIMVCM). Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization. Finally, a clustering module is constructed and optimized through a pseudo-label self-supervised training mechanism. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of DGIMVCM.

TL;DR: LoRaCompass is a reinforcement learning model that enables robust and efficient search for LoRa tags in unknown environments by learning spatial representations from RSSI signals and using UCB-inspired exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRa tag localization methods are vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuations, leading to cascading decision errors and poor localization accuracy.

Method: Uses spatially-aware feature extractor and policy distillation loss for robust spatial representation learning from RSSI, plus UCB-inspired exploration function for confident tag direction.

Result: Validated in diverse environments covering 80km², achieved >90% success rate within 100m proximity (40% improvement) and linear scaling of search path length with initial distance.

Conclusion: LoRaCompass provides robust and efficient LoRa tag localization, significantly outperforming existing methods in success rate and search efficiency.

Abstract: The Long-Range (LoRa) protocol, known for its extensive range and low power, has increasingly been adopted in tags worn by mentally incapacitated persons (MIPs) and others at risk of going missing. We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2. It has demonstrated high success rate (>90%) in locating the tag within 100m proximity (a 40% improvement over existing methods) and high efficiency with a search path length (in hops) that scales linearly with the initial distance.

Motivation: FL methods typically run for predefined rounds, leading to unnecessary computation when optimal performance is reached earlier, or continuing training even when meaningful performance isn't achieved.

Method: Introduces a zero-shot synthetic validation framework that leverages generative AI to monitor model performance and determine early stopping points adaptively.

Result: Reduces training rounds by up to 74% while maintaining accuracy within 1% of optimal on multi-label chest X-ray classification tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively conserves computational resources and enables rapid hyperparameter adjustments by adaptively stopping training near optimal rounds.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL methods typically run for a predefined number of global rounds, often leading to unnecessary computation when optimal performance is reached earlier. In addition, training may continue even when the model fails to achieve meaningful performance. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a zero-shot synthetic validation framework that leverages generative AI to monitor model performance and determine early stopping points. Our approach adaptively stops training near the optimal round, thereby conserving computational resources and enabling rapid hyperparameter adjustments. Numerical results on multi-label chest X-ray classification demonstrate that our method reduces training rounds by up to 74% while maintaining accuracy within 1% of the optimal.

Motivation: To develop general representation learning methods for Time Projection Chambers (TPC) that can work across diverse nuclear physics experiments, enabling better analysis of charged-particle tracks and event structures.

Method: Used sparse convolutional networks with ResNet architecture on TPC data represented as sparse tensors. Trained Minkowski Engine ResNet models on GADGET II TPC data and tested cross-detector generalization on AT-TPC data.

Result: Sparse ResNet models, even with random weights, provide useful structured vector embeddings of TPC events. Pre-training on physics-motivated classification tasks improves embedding quality. The method successfully generalized from GADGET II to AT-TPC data.

Conclusion: Sparse convolutional techniques show strong potential as a general tool for representation learning in diverse TPC experiments, providing effective event embeddings that work across different detector configurations.

Abstract: Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) are versatile detectors that reconstruct charged-particle tracks in an ionizing medium, enabling sensitive measurements across a wide range of nuclear physics experiments. We explore sparse convolutional networks for representation learning on TPC data, finding that a sparse ResNet architecture, even with randomly set weights, provides useful structured vector embeddings of events. Pre-training this architecture on a simple physics-motivated binary classification task further improves the embedding quality. Using data from the GAseous Detector with GErmanium Tagging (GADGET) II TPC, a detector optimized for measuring low-energy $β$-delayed particle decays, we represent raw pad-level signals as sparse tensors, train Minkowski Engine ResNet models, and probe the resulting event-level embeddings which reveal rich event structure. As a cross-detector test, we embed data from the Active-Target TPC (AT-TPC) -- a detector designed for nuclear reaction studies in inverse kinematics -- using the same encoder. We find that even an untrained sparse ResNet model provides useful embeddings of AT-TPC data, and we observe improvements when the model is trained on GADGET data. Together, these results highlight the potential of sparse convolutional techniques as a general tool for representation learning in diverse TPC experiments.

TL;DR: Virtual Width Networks (VWN) enable wider representations without quadratic cost by decoupling representational width from backbone width, achieving 2-3x optimization acceleration and log-linear scaling with virtual width.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the quadratic computational cost of increasing hidden size in neural networks while still benefiting from wider representations.

Method: Decouple representational width from backbone width, expanding embedding space while keeping backbone compute nearly constant.

Result: 8x expansion accelerates optimization by over 2x for next-token and 3x for next-2-token prediction, with loss gap growing and convergence-speedup ratio increasing over training.

Conclusion: VWN is token-efficient, increasingly effective with scale, and demonstrates log-linear scaling between virtual width and loss reduction, suggesting virtual-width scaling as a new dimension for large-model efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce Virtual Width Networks (VWN), a framework that delivers the benefits of wider representations without incurring the quadratic cost of increasing the hidden size. VWN decouples representational width from backbone width, expanding the embedding space while keeping backbone compute nearly constant. In our large-scale experiment, an 8-times expansion accelerates optimization by over 2 times for next-token and 3 times for next-2-token prediction. The advantage amplifies over training as both the loss gap grows and the convergence-speedup ratio increases, showing that VWN is not only token-efficient but also increasingly effective with scale. Moreover, we identify an approximately log-linear scaling relation between virtual width and loss reduction, offering an initial empirical basis and motivation for exploring virtual-width scaling as a new dimension of large-model efficiency.

TL;DR: HealSplit is a unified defense framework for Split Federated Learning that provides end-to-end detection and recovery against five types of poisoning attacks through topological anomaly detection, generative recovery, and multi-teacher distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Split Federated Learning is vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting various components, and existing FL defenses are ineffective in SFL due to limited access to complete model updates.

Method: HealSplit uses three components: topology-aware detection with graph-based anomaly scoring, generative recovery with semantic consistency validation, and adversarial multi-teacher distillation with vanilla and anomaly-debiasing teachers.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness across diverse attack scenarios.

Conclusion: HealSplit provides the first effective unified defense framework for SFL, offering comprehensive protection against sophisticated poisoning attacks through its integrated detection and recovery approach.

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) is an emerging paradigm for privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses, primarily adapted from traditional Federated Learning (FL), are less effective under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates. This paper presents HealSplit, the first unified defense framework tailored for SFL, offering end-to-end detection and recovery against five sophisticated types of poisoning attacks. HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness and defense effectiveness across diverse attack scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph kernels struggle to simultaneously capture heterogeneous attribute semantics and neighborhood information in attributed graphs with mixed numerical and categorical features.

Method: Uses exponential transformation of Gower similarity coefficient for mixed attributes and star substructures enhanced by Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations for multi-scale neighborhood information.

Result: NASK consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art baselines (9 graph kernels and 7 GNNs) on 11 attributed and 4 large-scale real-world graph benchmarks.

Conclusion: NASK provides an effective framework for attributed graph learning that successfully integrates attribute semantics and structural information while being theoretically sound and practically superior.

Abstract: Attributed graphs, typically characterized by irregular topologies and a mix of numerical and categorical attributes, are ubiquitous in diverse domains such as social networks, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics. While graph kernels provide a principled framework for measuring graph similarity, existing kernel methods often struggle to simultaneously capture heterogeneous attribute semantics and neighborhood information in attributed graphs. In this work, we propose the Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernel (NASK), a novel graph kernel designed for attributed graph learning. NASK leverages an exponential transformation of the Gower similarity coefficient to jointly model numerical and categorical features efficiently, and employs star substructures enhanced by Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations to integrate multi-scale neighborhood structural information. We theoretically prove that NASK is positive definite, ensuring compatibility with kernel-based learning frameworks such as SVMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven attributed and four large-scale real-world graph benchmarks. The results demonstrate that NASK consistently achieves superior performance over sixteen state-of-the-art baselines, including nine graph kernels and seven Graph Neural Networks.

TL;DR: EHR-based predictive models significantly outperform traditional risk factors (3-6x higher enrichment) for identifying high-risk individuals across multiple cancers, with foundation models further improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cancer screening guidelines are limited to few cancer types and rely on narrow criteria like age or single risk factors, missing many high-risk individuals.

Method: Systematic evaluation using All of Us Research Program data (865,000+ participants) comparing EHR-based models against traditional risk factors across 8 major cancers, including baseline modeling and state-of-the-art foundation models trained on comprehensive patient trajectories.

Result: EHR-based models achieved 3-6x higher enrichment of true cancer cases among high-risk individuals compared to traditional risk factors alone, with foundation models further improving performance across 26 cancer types.

Conclusion: EHR-based predictive modeling has strong clinical potential to support more precise and scalable early cancer detection strategies, outperforming current screening approaches.

Abstract: Current cancer screening guidelines cover only a few cancer types and rely on narrowly defined criteria such as age or a single risk factor like smoking history, to identify high-risk individuals. Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.

TL;DR: MTPC is a framework using probabilistic circuits to improve multi-token prediction in LLMs by modeling joint distributions of future tokens, significantly speeding up generation while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-token prediction methods sacrifice expressiveness by assuming independence between future tokens, limiting their effectiveness in speeding up generation for tokenizer-free byte-level LLMs.

Method: Proposes MTPC framework using probabilistic circuits to encode joint distributions over future tokens, generalizing classical models like mixture models, HMMs, and tensor networks. Combines with speculative decoding and explores parameterizations like PC architectures and partial layer sharing.

Result: MTPC significantly speeds up generation compared to MTP with independence assumptions when retrofitting byte-level LLMs like EvaByte, while guaranteeing to retain original verifier LLM performance.

Conclusion: MTPC provides an effective framework for exploring the trade-off between expressiveness and latency in multi-token prediction, offering superior speed improvements while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a prominent strategy to significantly speed up generation in large language models (LLMs), including byte-level LLMs, which are tokeniser-free but prohibitively slow. However, existing MTP methods often sacrifice expressiveness by assuming independence between future tokens. In this work, we investigate the trade-off between expressiveness and latency in MTP within the framework of probabilistic circuits (PCs). Our framework, named MTPC, allows one to explore different ways to encode the joint distributions over future tokens by selecting different circuit architectures, generalising classical models such as (hierarchical) mixture models, hidden Markov models and tensor networks. We show the efficacy of MTPC by retrofitting existing byte-level LLMs, such as EvaByte. Our experiments show that, when combined with speculative decoding, MTPC significantly speeds up generation compared to MTP with independence assumptions, while guaranteeing to retain the performance of the original verifier LLM. We also rigorously study the optimal trade-off between expressiveness and latency when exploring the possible parameterisations of MTPC, such as PC architectures and partial layer sharing between the verifier and draft LLMs.

Motivation: Development of MLFFs for cathode materials is limited due to complex electronic structures and scarcity of high-quality training datasets, particularly for lithium-ion battery applications.

Method: Multi-fidelity MLFF framework that simultaneously utilizes both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets for training force fields.

Result: Tests on lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode material system demonstrate the effectiveness of the multi-fidelity approach.

Conclusion: This framework enables high-accuracy MLFF training for cathode materials at lower dataset costs and provides new perspectives for applying MLFFs in cathode material simulations.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs), which employ neural networks to map atomic structures to system energies, effectively combine the high accuracy of first-principles calculation with the computational efficiency of empirical force fields. They are widely used in computational materials simulations. However, the development and application of MLFFs for lithium-ion battery cathode materials remain relatively limited. This is primarily due to the complex electronic structure characteristics of cathode materials and the resulting scarcity of high-quality computational datasets available for force field training. In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity machine learning force field framework to enhance the data efficiency of computational results, which can simultaneously utilize both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets of cathode materials for training. Tests conducted on the lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode material system demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-fidelity approach. This work helps to achieve high-accuracy MLFF training for cathode materials at a lower training dataset cost, and offers new perspectives for applying MLFFs to computational simulations of cathode materials.

TL;DR: MeZO enables on-device fine-tuning of larger models by eliminating activation storage needs, trading off wall-clock time for memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable edge AI systems to adapt to tasks under strict memory constraints where conventional backpropagation fails due to activation storage overhead.

Method: Uses zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) that estimates gradients through forward evaluations only, eliminating need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states.

Result: MeZO allows significantly larger models to fit in on-chip memory compared to BP, with accuracy advantages under memory constraints given sufficient fine-tuning time.

Conclusion: MeZO is a viable approach for on-device fine-tuning that overcomes memory limitations of BP, enabling deployment of larger models on edge devices.

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning is a critical capability for edge AI systems, which must support adaptation to different agentic tasks under stringent memory constraints. Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training. We then numerically validate the analysis, demonstrating that MeZO exhibits accuracy advantages under on-device memory constraints, provided sufficient wall-clock time is available for fine-tuning.

TL;DR: SemST is a semantic-guided deep learning framework that uses LLMs to extract biological meaning from gene symbols and combines them with spatial relationships via GNNs for superior spatial transcriptomics clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational models treat genes as isolated numerical features, ignoring the rich biological semantics in gene symbols, which prevents deep understanding of biological characteristics in spatial transcriptomics.

Method: Uses LLMs to transform gene sets into biologically informed embeddings, fuses them with spatial neighborhood relationships via GNNs, and introduces Fine-grained Semantic Modulation module for element-wise calibration of spatial features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance on public spatial transcriptomics datasets, with the FSM module showing plug-and-play versatility to improve other baseline methods.

Conclusion: SemST successfully integrates biological function and spatial structure through semantic guidance, enabling deeper biological insights in spatial transcriptomics analysis.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables gene expression profiling with spatial context, offering unprecedented insights into the tissue microenvironment. However, most computational models treat genes as isolated numerical features, ignoring the rich biological semantics encoded in their symbols. This prevents a truly deep understanding of critical biological characteristics. To overcome this limitation, we present SemST, a semantic-guided deep learning framework for spatial transcriptomics data clustering. SemST leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable genes to "speak" through their symbolic meanings, transforming gene sets within each tissue spot into biologically informed embeddings. These embeddings are then fused with the spatial neighborhood relationships captured by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), achieving a coherent integration of biological function and spatial structure. We further introduce the Fine-grained Semantic Modulation (FSM) module to optimally exploit these biological priors. The FSM module learns spot-specific affine transformations that empower the semantic embeddings to perform an element-wise calibration of the spatial features, thus dynamically injecting high-order biological knowledge into the spatial context. Extensive experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets show that SemST achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance. Crucially, the FSM module exhibits plug-and-play versatility, consistently improving the performance when integrated into other baseline methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A spectrally normalized neural network for mechanical homogenization that guarantees physical admissibility by learning representations bounded between Voigt-Reuss limits, enabling both forward prediction and inverse design with hard physical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a homogenization method that provides physically guaranteed bounds on material properties while enabling both accurate forward prediction and constraint-consistent inverse design, overcoming limitations of traditional approaches that may violate physical constraints.

Method: Leverages Voigt-Reuss bounds by factorizing their difference via a Cholesky-like operator to learn dimensionless, symmetric positive semi-definite representations with eigenvalues in [0,1]. Uses neural networks with spectral normalization and isotropy-invariant descriptors for 3D linear elasticity, and combines with differentiable renderer and CNN for 2D plane strain.

Result: Achieves near-perfect fidelity for isotropic projections (R² ≥ 0.998), median tensor-level relative Frobenius errors ≈1.7%, mean ≈3.4%. For 2D, achieves R²>0.99 on all components, subpercent normalized losses, accurate tracking of percolation-induced eigenvalue jumps, and robust generalization to out-of-distribution images.

Conclusion: The Voigt-Reuss net unifies accurate, physically admissible forward prediction with large-batch, constraint-consistent inverse design, and is generic to elliptic operators and coupled-physics settings, enabling diverse near-optimal designs through first-order optimization.

Abstract: We propose a spectrally normalized surrogate for forward and inverse mechanical homogenization with hard physical guarantees. Leveraging the Voigt-Reuss bounds, we factor their difference via a Cholesky-like operator and learn a dimensionless, symmetric positive semi-definite representation with eigenvalues in $[0,1]$; the inverse map returns symmetric positive-definite predictions that lie between the bounds in the Löwner sense. In 3D linear elasticity on an open dataset of stochastic biphasic microstructures, a fully connected Voigt-Reuss net trained on $>\!7.5\times 10^{5}$ FFT-based labels with 236 isotropy-invariant descriptors and three contrast parameters recovers the isotropic projection with near-perfect fidelity (isotropy-related entries: $R^2 \ge 0.998$), while anisotropy-revealing couplings are unidentifiable from $SO(3)$-invariant inputs. Tensor-level relative Frobenius errors have median $\approx 1.7\%$ and mean $\approx 3.4\%$ across splits. For 2D plane strain on thresholded trigonometric microstructures, coupling spectral normalization with a differentiable renderer and a CNN yields $R^2>0.99$ on all components, subpercent normalized losses, accurate tracking of percolation-induced eigenvalue jumps, and robust generalization to out-of-distribution images. Treating the parametric microstructure as design variables, batched first-order optimization with a single surrogate matches target tensors within a few percent and returns diverse near-optimal designs. Overall, the Voigt-Reuss net unifies accurate, physically admissible forward prediction with large-batch, constraint-consistent inverse design, and is generic to elliptic operators and coupled-physics settings.

Method: End-to-end deep learning approach treating phase shifter and true-time delay coefficients as trainable variables to synthesize task-oriented beams, with a lightweight fully connected module for angle-range coordinate recovery from user feedback.

Result: Reduces overhead by an order of magnitude compared to existing schemes and delivers consistently lower two-dimensional positioning error.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning-based scheme effectively integrates beam design and localization, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced overhead in phase-time array systems.

Abstract: Phase-time arrays, which integrate phase shifters (PSs) and true-time delays (TTDs), have emerged as a cost-effective architecture for generating frequency-dependent rainbow beams in wideband sensing and localization. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning-based scheme that simultaneously designs the rainbow beams and estimates user positions. Treating the PS and TTD coefficients as trainable variables allows the network to synthesize task-oriented beams that maximize localization accuracy. A lightweight fully connected module then recovers the user's angle-range coordinates from its feedback of the maximum quantized received power and its corresponding subcarrier index after a single downlink transmission. Compared with existing analytical and learning-based schemes, the proposed method reduces overhead by an order of magnitude and delivers consistently lower two-dimensional positioning error.

TL;DR: Transformer-based RL framework for unified multi-phase spacecraft control that eliminates manual phase transitions and maintains coherent memory across dynamically distinct mission phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches require separate policies for different mission phases (launch, ascent, stage separation, orbit insertion), limiting adaptability and increasing operational complexity.

Method: Transformer encoder-decoder architecture replacing conventional recurrent networks, using Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) with PPO reinforcement learning to maintain temporal context across mission phases spanning seconds to minutes.

Result: Matches analytical solutions in simple cases, effectively learns coherent control policies across dynamically distinct regimes, and demonstrates near-optimal performance on single-phase benchmarks and complex multiphase rocket ascent problems.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for scalable autonomous mission planning that reduces reliance on phase-specific controllers while maintaining compatibility with safety-critical verification protocols.

Abstract: Autonomous spacecraft control for mission phases such as launch, ascent, stage separation, and orbit insertion remains a critical challenge due to the need for adaptive policies that generalize across dynamically distinct regimes. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in individual astrodynamics tasks, existing approaches often require separate policies for distinct mission phases, limiting adaptability and increasing operational complexity. This work introduces a transformer-based RL framework that unifies multi-phase trajectory optimization through a single policy architecture, leveraging the transformer's inherent capacity to model extended temporal contexts. Building on proximal policy optimization (PPO), our framework replaces conventional recurrent networks with a transformer encoder-decoder structure, enabling the agent to maintain coherent memory across mission phases spanning seconds to minutes during critical operations. By integrating a Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) architecture, the framework eliminates manual phase transitions while maintaining stability in control decisions. We validate our approach progressively: first demonstrating near-optimal performance on single-phase benchmarks (double integrator and Van der Pol oscillator), then extending to multiphase waypoint navigation variants, and finally tackling a complex multiphase rocket ascent problem that includes atmospheric flight, stage separation, and vacuum operations. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based framework not only matches analytical solutions in simple cases but also effectively learns coherent control policies across dynamically distinct regimes, establishing a foundation for scalable autonomous mission planning that reduces reliance on phase-specific controllers while maintaining compatibility with safety-critical verification protocols.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using multicalibration to improve matching decisions in weighted graphs when given imperfect weight predictions, showing that multicalibrated predictors can compete with the best decision rules applied to original predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard optimal matching rules assume perfect weight predictions, but in practice predictors are imperfect. Suboptimal decision rules may outperform optimal ones when compensating for prediction errors.

Method: Propose multicalibration as a fairness notion requiring unbiased predictions on protected context sets. Construct multicalibrated predictors from any given predictor, then select best matching based on these calibrated predictions.

Result: Show that using multicalibrated predictors for matching decisions is competitive with applying the best decision rule directly to the original predictor. Provide sample complexity bounds.

Conclusion: Multicalibration provides an effective approach to handle imperfect predictions in matching problems, enabling competitive performance compared to applying optimal decision rules to uncalibrated predictions.

Abstract: Consider the problem of finding the best matching in a weighted graph where we only have access to predictions of the actual stochastic weights, based on an underlying context. If the predictor is the Bayes optimal one, then computing the best matching based on the predicted weights is optimal. However, in practice, this perfect information scenario is not realistic. Given an imperfect predictor, a suboptimal decision rule may compensate for the induced error and thus outperform the standard optimal rule.
  In this paper, we propose multicalibration as a way to address this problem. This fairness notion requires a predictor to be unbiased on each element of a family of protected sets of contexts. Given a class of matching algorithms $\mathcal C$ and any predictor $γ$ of the edge-weights, we show how to construct a specific multicalibrated predictor $\hat γ$, with the following property. Picking the best matching based on the output of $\hat γ$ is competitive with the best decision rule in $\mathcal C$ applied onto the original predictor $γ$. We complement this result by providing sample complexity bounds.

Method: Uses JAX-FEM's automatic differentiation for direct gradient-based admittance estimation from sparse pressure measurements, and combines JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD, separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation.

Result: Achieved 3-digit precision in admittance estimation without manual adjoint derivation, and 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference methods.

Conclusion: Modern differentiable software stacks enable efficient optimization workflows for physics-based inverse problems, with AD for parameter estimation and hybrid finite differences/AD for geometric design.

Abstract: We demonstrate a practical differentiable programming approach for acoustic inverse problems through two applications: admittance estimation and shape optimization for resonance damping. First, we show that JAX-FEM's automatic differentiation (AD) enables direct gradient-based estimation of complex boundary admittance from sparse pressure measurements, achieving 3-digit precision without requiring manual derivation of adjoint equations. Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh. This work showcases how modern differentiable software stacks enable rapid prototyping of optimization workflows for physics-based inverse problems, with automatic differentiation for parameter estimation and a combination of finite differences and AD for geometric design.

TL;DR: OT-based quantization effectively compresses Flow Matching models to 2-3 bits per parameter while maintaining generation quality, outperforming uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching models face practical deployment challenges due to high-precision parameter requirements, necessitating efficient compression methods for edge and embedded AI applications.

Method: Adapt optimal transport-based post-training quantization to minimize 2-Wasserstein distance between quantized and original weights, with systematic comparison against uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic quantization schemes.

Result: OT-based quantization preserves visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter across five benchmark datasets, where alternative methods fail.

Conclusion: OT-based quantization is a principled, effective approach for compressing FM generative models, enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) generative models offer efficient simulation-free training and deterministic sampling, but their practical deployment is challenged by high-precision parameter requirements. We adapt optimal transport (OT)-based post-training quantization to FM models, minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between quantized and original weights, and systematically compare its effectiveness against uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic quantization schemes. Our theoretical analysis provides upper bounds on generative degradation under quantization, and empirical results across five benchmark datasets of varying complexity show that OT-based quantization preserves both visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter, where alternative methods fail. This establishes OT-based quantization as a principled, effective approach to compress FM generative models for edge and embedded AI applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RETROFIT is a data-free continual learning method that merges old and new model parameters without needing historical data, achieving bounded forgetting and effective knowledge transfer in security applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual learning methods require full retraining or data replay, which is infeasible in data-sensitive security environments, and struggle with preserving old knowledge while integrating new knowledge without interference.

Method: Consolidates previously trained and newly fine-tuned models as teachers through parameter-level merging, using low-rank and sparse updates to confine changes to independent subspaces, with knowledge arbitration balancing teacher contributions based on model confidence.

Result: In malware detection under temporal drift, improved retention score from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines and exceeded oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization, achieved around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning and surpassed all baselines in cross-representation generalization.

Conclusion: RETROFIT effectively mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability in security-critical scenarios without requiring historical data, demonstrating superior performance in both malware detection and binary summarization tasks.

Abstract: Modern security analytics are increasingly powered by deep learning models, but their performance often degrades as threat landscapes evolve and data representations shift. While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.
  We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.

*Xiaoyin Xi,Zhe Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes FairReweighing, a pre-processing algorithm for fairness in regression tasks using mutual information-based metrics and density estimation to ensure separation criterion while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI software lacks transparency in high-stakes applications, raising fairness concerns across racial, gender, and age groups. Most fairness research focuses on binary classification, leaving regression fairness underexplored.

Method: Adopts mutual information-based metric for separation violations, extends it for classification/regression with binary/continuous sensitive attributes. Proposes FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation inspired by Reweighing in fair classification.

Result: Theoretically guarantees separation in training data under data independence assumption. Empirically outperforms state-of-the-art regression fairness solutions on synthetic and real-world data in improving separation while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: FairReweighing effectively addresses fairness in regression tasks, providing theoretical guarantees and empirical superiority over existing methods in balancing separation and accuracy.

Abstract: There has been a prevalence of applying AI software in both high-stakes public-sector and industrial contexts. However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the proposed FairReweighing algorithm can guarantee separation in the training data under a data independence assumption. Empirically, on both synthetic and real-world data, we show that FairReweighing outperforms existing state-of-the-art regression fairness solutions in terms of improving separation while maintaining high accuracy.

*Riku Green,Huw Day,Zahraa S. Abdallah,Telmo M. Silva Filho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges traditional bias-variance intuition for multi-step forecasting, showing that recursive strategies can have both lower bias and higher variance than direct strategies due to model nonlinearity and parameter sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit the conventional belief that recursive forecasting has high bias/low variance while direct forecasting has low bias/high variance, by providing a more nuanced theoretical framework.

Method: Decomposes multi-step forecast error into irreducible noise, structural approximation gap, and estimation-variance term. For linear predictors, shows structural gap is zero; for nonlinear predictors, analyzes how recursion increases model expressivity and introduces Jacobian-based amplification of parameter errors.

Result: Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on ETTm1 dataset confirm that recursive forecasting can simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting, depending on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics rather than traditional bias-variance intuition.

Abstract: Multi-step forecasting is often described through a simple rule of thumb: recursive strategies are said to have high bias and low variance, while direct strategies are said to have low bias and high variance. We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.

TL;DR: A transformer-based model synthesizes radar spectrograms from Motion-Capture data, achieving plausible results with good generalizability and requiring less computation than physics-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a machine learning approach for generating radar data from more abundant MoCap data, enabling dataset augmentation and reducing computational requirements compared to physics-based methods.

Method: Formulates MoCap-to-spectrogram translation as a windowed sequence-to-sequence task using a transformer-based model that captures spatial relations among MoCap markers and temporal dynamics across frames.

Result: The approach produces visually and quantitatively plausible doppler radar spectrograms with good generalizability, demonstrating ability to convert multi-part motion into doppler signatures and understand spatial body relations.

Conclusion: This work shows transformers' effectiveness for time-series signal processing, particularly for edge/IoT radar applications, and enables radar dataset augmentation using abundant MoCap data with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: We present a pure machine learning process for synthesizing radar spectrograms from Motion-Capture (MoCap) data. We formulate MoCap-to-spectrogram translation as a windowed sequence-to-sequence task using a transformer-based model that jointly captures spatial relations among MoCap markers and temporal dynamics across frames. Real-world experiments show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively plausible doppler radar spectrograms and achieves good generalizability. Ablation experiments show that the learned model includes both the ability to convert multi-part motion into doppler signatures and an understanding of the spatial relations between different parts of the human body.
  The result is an interesting example of using transformers for time-series signal processing. It is especially applicable to edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) radars. It also suggests the ability to augment scarce radar datasets using more abundant MoCap data for training higher-level applications. Finally, it requires far less computation than physics-based methods for generating radar data.

### [226] [Quantifying and Improving Adaptivity in Conformal Prediction through Input Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11472)
*Sooyong Jang,Insup Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes improved evaluation metrics for conformal prediction adaptiveness using uniform-mass binning and introduces a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness in conformal prediction suffer from imbalanced binning, leading to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size.

Method: Uses input transformations to sort examples by difficulty followed by uniform-mass binning, and proposes a new algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction.

Result: The proposed metrics correlate more strongly with desired adaptiveness property and the new algorithm outperforms existing approaches on ImageNet classification and medical visual acuity prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed binning method and metrics provide more reliable adaptiveness assessment, and the new adaptive prediction set algorithm achieves better performance according to the improved evaluation framework.

Abstract: Conformal prediction constructs a set of labels instead of a single point prediction, while providing a probabilistic coverage guarantee. Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group. Experimental results on both (a) an Image Classification (ImageNet) (b) a medical task (visual acuity prediction) show that our method outperforms existing approaches according to the new metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding carbide precipitates in reactor-pressure-vessel steel is crucial for predicting mechanical properties, but SEM image segmentation is challenging due to gray-value overlap between carbides and matrix, making simple thresholding ineffective.

Method: A lightweight U-Net architecture with 30.7M parameters trained on just 10 annotated scanning electron microscopy images using a data-efficient segmentation pipeline.

Result: Achieves Dice-Sørensen coefficient of 0.98, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art classical image analysis (0.85) and reducing annotation effort by one order of magnitude compared to other data-efficient segmentation models.

Conclusion: This approach enables rapid, automated carbide quantification for alloy design, generalizes to other steel types, and demonstrates the potential of data-efficient deep learning in reactor-pressure-vessel steel analysis.

Abstract: Understanding reactor-pressure-vessel steel microstructure is crucial for predicting mechanical properties, as carbide precipitates both strengthen the alloy and can initiate cracks. In scanning electron microscopy images, gray-value overlap between carbides and matrix makes simple thresholding ineffective. We present a data-efficient segmentation pipeline using a lightweight U-Net (30.7~M parameters) trained on just \textbf{10 annotated scanning electron microscopy images}. Despite limited data, our model achieves a \textbf{Dice-Sørensen coefficient of 0.98}, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art in the field of metallurgy (classical image analysis: 0.85), while reducing annotation effort by one order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art data efficient segmentation model. This approach enables rapid, automated carbide quantification for alloy design and generalizes to other steel types, demonstrating the potential of data-efficient deep learning in reactor-pressure-vessel steel analysis.

*Joan Font-Quer Roset,Devina Mohan,Anna Scaife*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper estimates the intrinsic dimension of the Radio Galaxy Zoo dataset using a score-based diffusion model and analyzes how it varies with energy scores, morphological classes, and signal-to-noise ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complexity and structure of radio galaxy data by measuring intrinsic dimension, and to examine how it relates to distributional properties and classification characteristics.

Method: Used a score-based diffusion model to estimate intrinsic dimension, analyzed variations with Bayesian neural network energy scores, Fanaroff-Riley morphological classes, and signal-to-noise ratio.

Result: Found that out-of-distribution sources have higher intrinsic dimension values, RGZ overall has higher intrinsic dimension than natural image datasets, no relationship between FR I and FR II classes, and a weak trend of higher SNR at lower intrinsic dimension.

Conclusion: The relationship between intrinsic dimension and energy scores can be used to quantitatively study and improve representations learned by self-supervised learning algorithms on radio galaxy data.

Abstract: In this work, we estimate the intrinsic dimension (iD) of the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset using a score-based diffusion model. We examine how the iD estimates vary as a function of Bayesian neural network (BNN) energy scores, which measure how similar the radio sources are to the MiraBest subset of the RGZ dataset. We find that out-of-distribution sources exhibit higher iD values, and that the overall iD for RGZ exceeds those typically reported for natural image datasets. Furthermore, we analyse how iD varies across Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphological classes and as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While no relationship is found between FR I and FR II classes, a weak trend toward higher SNR at lower iD. Future work using the RGZ dataset could make use of the relationship between iD and energy scores to quantitatively study and improve the representations learned by various self-supervised learning algorithms.

### [229] [Honesty over Accuracy: Trustworthy Language Models through Reinforced Hesitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11500)
*Mohamad Amin Mohamadi,Tianhao Wang,Zhiyuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Reinforced Hesitation (RH), a method that trains language models to abstain from answering when uncertain, using ternary rewards instead of binary ones. This enables models to avoid confident hallucinations and improves trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models fail to abstain when uncertain, producing confident hallucinations even when wrong answers could have severe consequences. This undermines trust in AI systems.

Method: Reinforced Hesitation modifies RLVR with ternary rewards: +1 for correct answers, 0 for abstention, and -λ for errors. The method trains models along a Pareto frontier by varying λ, and introduces cascading and self-cascading inference strategies.

Result: Experiments on GSM8K, MedQA, and GPQA show that varying λ produces optimal models for different risk regimes. Cascading and self-cascading strategies outperform majority voting with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Abstention should be a first-class training objective, transforming 'I don't know' from failure into a coordination signal that enables models to earn trust through calibrated honesty about their limits.

Abstract: Modern language models fail a fundamental requirement of trustworthy intelligence: knowing when not to answer. Despite achieving impressive accuracy on benchmarks, these models produce confident hallucinations, even when wrong answers carry catastrophic consequences. Our evaluations on GSM8K, MedQA and GPQA show frontier models almost never abstain despite explicit warnings of severe penalties, suggesting that prompts cannot override training that rewards any answer over no answer. As a remedy, we propose Reinforced Hesitation (RH): a modification to Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to use ternary rewards (+1 correct, 0 abstention, -$λ$ error) instead of binary. Controlled experiments on logic puzzles reveal that varying $λ$ produces distinct models along a Pareto frontier, where each training penalty yields the optimal model for its corresponding risk regime: low penalties produce aggressive answerers, high penalties conservative abstainers. We then introduce two inference strategies that exploit trained abstention as a coordination signal: cascading routes queries through models with decreasing risk tolerance, while self-cascading re-queries the same model on abstention. Both outperform majority voting with lower computational cost. These results establish abstention as a first-class training objective that transforms ``I don't know'' from failure into a coordination signal, enabling models to earn trust through calibrated honesty about their limits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blocking communication is a major efficiency bottleneck for running Mixture of Experts (MoE) models in distributed settings, limiting their performance.

Method: Modifies model architecture by adding skip connections to enable overlapping of computation with communication, and uses self-distillation to convert large models (16B-109B parameters) while maintaining accuracy.

Result: Successfully converted models from 16B to 109B parameters (including Llama 4 Scout 109B) with average accuracy within 1% of original releases across downstream evaluations, while enabling communication-computation overlap.

Conclusion: FarSkip-Collective enables efficient distributed MoE execution by architecturally enabling communication-computation overlap without sacrificing model accuracy, accelerating both training and inference.

Abstract: Blocking communication presents a major hurdle in running MoEs efficiently in distributed settings. To address this, we present FarSkip-Collective which modifies the architecture of modern models to enable overlapping of their computation with communication. Our approach modifies the architecture to skip connections in the model and it is unclear a priori whether the modified model architecture can remain as capable, especially for large state-of-the-art models and while modifying all of the model layers. We answer this question in the affirmative and fully convert a series of state-of-the-art models varying from 16B to 109B parameters to enable overlapping of their communication while achieving accuracy on par with their original open-source releases. For example, we convert Llama 4 Scout (109B) via self-distillation and achieve average accuracy within 1% of its instruction tuned release averaged across a wide range of downstream evaluations. In addition to demonstrating retained accuracy of the large modified models, we realize the benefits of FarSkip-Collective through optimized implementations that explicitly overlap communication with computation, accelerating both training and inference in existing frameworks.

TL;DR: The paper generalizes closest fair clustering to multiple groups, shows NP-hardness for equal-sized groups, provides near-linear approximation algorithms, and extends results to fair correlation clustering and fair consensus clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional clustering often fails to provide fair representation for marginalized communities with multiple protected attributes, creating a need for fair clustering methods that work with minimal modifications.

Method: Generalized closest fair clustering to arbitrary number of groups, proved NP-hardness for equal-sized groups, developed near-linear time approximation algorithms for multiple groups.

Result: Successfully addressed open questions from previous work by providing efficient approximation algorithms for multiple groups, improved guarantees for fair correlation clustering, and first approximation algorithms for fair consensus clustering with multiple groups.

Conclusion: The work provides comprehensive solutions for fair clustering with multiple protected attributes, answering key open questions and advancing the state-of-the-art in fair clustering algorithms.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in machine learning and data analysis, but it frequently fails to provide fair representation for various marginalized communities defined by multiple protected attributes -- a shortcoming often caused by biases in the training data. As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.
  In this work, we generalize the study of the \emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].
  Leveraging our closest fair clustering algorithms, we further achieve improved approximation guarantees for the \emph{fair correlation clustering} problem, advancing the state-of-the-art results established by Ahmadian et al. [AISTATS'20] and Ahmadi et al. [2020]. Additionally, we are the first to provide approximation algorithms for the \emph{fair consensus clustering} problem involving multiple (more than two) groups, thus addressing another open direction highlighted by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-attention dynamics in transformers are related to multiagent Oja flow, with four types of equilibria: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering, and polygonal equilibria. Multiple stable equilibria often coexist, with some aligned to eigenvectors of the value matrix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the continuous-time dynamics of self-attention mechanisms in transformers and their relationship to established dynamical systems like Oja flow, which computes principal eigenvectors.

Method: Analyzed self-attention dynamics as a continuous-time multiagent system, relating it to multiagent Oja flow, and classified equilibria into four categories based on their structural properties.

Result: Identified four classes of equilibria in single-head self-attention systems. Found that multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from consensus, bipartite consensus, and clustering classes often coexist. Some equilibria align with eigenvectors of the value matrix, particularly the principal eigenvector.

Conclusion: Self-attention dynamics exhibit rich equilibrium structures with multiple stable states, providing insights into how transformers process information through attention mechanisms and their connection to eigenvector computation.

Abstract: In machine learning, a self-attention dynamics is a continuous-time multiagent-like model of the attention mechanisms of transformers. In this paper we show that such dynamics is related to a multiagent version of the Oja flow, a dynamical system that computes the principal eigenvector of a matrix corresponding for transformers to the value matrix. We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head'' self-attention system into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering and polygonal equilibria. Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from the first three classes often coexist in the self-attention dynamics. Interestingly, equilibria from the first two classes are always aligned with the eigenvectors of the value matrix, often but not exclusively with the principal eigenvector.

TL;DR: Comparison of two communication strategies (S2S and S2A) in semi-decentralized federated learning, showing performance depends on data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of rigorous theoretical and empirical comparison between S2S (sampled-to-sampled) and S2A (sampled-to-all) strategies in semi-decentralized FL.

Method: Developed unified convergence framework analyzing sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity; conducted analytical and experimental evaluation.

Result: Identified distinct regimes where S2S or S2A performs better depending on data heterogeneity across devices.

Conclusion: Provides concrete design guidelines for practical semi-decentralized FL deployments based on data heterogeneity patterns.

Abstract: In semi-decentralized federated learning, devices primarily rely on device-to-device communication but occasionally interact with a central server. Periodically, a sampled subset of devices uploads their local models to the server, which computes an aggregate model. The server can then either (i) share this aggregate model only with the sampled clients (sampled-to-sampled, S2S) or (ii) broadcast it to all clients (sampled-to-all, S2A). Despite their practical significance, a rigorous theoretical and empirical comparison of these two strategies remains absent. We address this gap by analyzing S2S and S2A within a unified convergence framework that accounts for key system parameters: sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Our results, both analytical and experimental, reveal distinct regimes where one strategy outperforms the other, depending primarily on the degree of data heterogeneity across devices. These insights lead to concrete design guidelines for practical semi-decentralized FL deployments.

Result: Improved MoBA models match dense attention baseline performance. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making theoretical improvements practical.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical foundation for MoBA, identifies key architectural improvements, and delivers practical implementation via FlashMoBA, enabling efficient long-context processing while maintaining performance comparable to dense attention.

Abstract: Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA) (Lu et al., 2025) is a promising building block for efficiently processing long contexts in LLMs by enabling queries to sparsely attend to a small subset of key-value blocks, drastically reducing computational cost. However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D constellations are promising candidates for high-quality and reliable next-generation digital communication systems due to their improved MED and error performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a simple and effective method for constructing higher-order three-dimensional (3D) signal constellations, aiming to enhance the reliability of digital communication systems. The approach systematically extends the conventional two-dimensional hexagonal quadrature amplitude modulation (2D-HQAM) constellation into a 3D-HQAM signal space, forming structured lattice configurations. To address the increased decision complexity resulting from a larger number of constellation points, a dimension reduction (DR) technique is introduced, allowing the derivation of closed-form symbol error probability (SEP) expressions under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) conditions. Theoretical SEPs closely match simulation results, validating the accuracy of the proposed method. The minimum Euclidean distance (MED) of the 3D constellations shows a minimum increase of 12.14% over 2D constellation for 8-HQAM, reaching up to 160.81% for 1024-HQAM constellations. This significant improvement in MED leads to enhanced error performance. Therefore, the proposed 3D constellations are promising candidates for high-quality and reliable next-generation digital communication systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge gap between algorithmic design and practical deployment in D-MIMO systems, addressing limitations of idealized channel models and lack of hardware validation in existing studies.

Method: Fine-tuned pre-trained GNN-based model using real-world CSI from Techtile platform, evaluated under interpolation/extrapolation scenarios with end-to-end validation on D-MIMO testbed with hardware reciprocity calibration.

Result: 15.7% performance gain over pre-trained model in multi-user case; near-MRT performance in single-user scenario (0.7 bits/channel use degradation from 5.19 bits/channel use total throughput); data efficiency demonstrated with consistent gains from increasing training samples.

Conclusion: Framework successfully validates AI-based precoder on real D-MIMO hardware, achieving significant performance improvements and demonstrating practical viability of AI-driven precoding in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Distributed MIMO (D-MIMO) has emerged as a key architecture for future sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling cooperative transmission across spatially distributed access points (APs). However, most existing studies rely on idealized channel models and lack hardware validation, leaving a gap between algorithmic design and practical deployment. Meanwhile, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven precoding have shown strong potential for learning nonlinear channel-to-precoder mappings, but their real-world deployment remains limited due to challenges in data collection and model generalization. This work presents a framework for implementing and validating an AI-based precoder on a D-MIMO testbed with hardware reciprocity calibration. A pre-trained graph neural network (GNN)-based model is fine-tuned using real-world channel state information (CSI) collected from the Techtile platform and evaluated under both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios before end-to-end validation. Experimental results demonstrate a 15.7% performance gain over the pre-trained model in the multi-user case after fine-tuning, while in the single-user scenario the model achieves near-maximum ratio transmission (MRT) performance with less than 0.7 bits/channel use degradation out of a total throughput of 5.19 bits/channel use on unseen positions. Further analysis confirms the data efficiency of real-world measurements, showing consistent gains with increasing training samples, and end-to-end validation verifies coherent power focusing comparable to MRT.

Result: Validated with urban measurement data, shows excellent agreement in LOS/NLOS path loss, reduces RMSE by 7.1 dB vs 3GPP and 3.18 dB vs simplified models in NLOS scenarios, accurately captures Doppler characteristics.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates scalability and generalization capability for accurate urban radio propagation prediction, particularly effective for complex diffraction mechanisms in NLOS conditions.

Abstract: With the rapid deployment of 5G and future 6G networks, accurate modeling of urban radio propagation has become critical for system design and network planning. However, conventional statistical or empirical models fail to fully capture the influence of detailed geometric features in dense urban environments. In this paper, we propose a geometry map-based propagation model that directly extracts key parameters from a 3D geometry map and incorporates the Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) to recursively compute multiple diffraction fields, thereby enabling accurate prediction of large-scale path loss and time-varying Doppler characteristics in urban channels. A significant buildings identification algorithm is developed to efficiently detect buildings that significantly affect signal propagation. The proposed model is validated using urban measurement data, showing excellent agreement with path loss in both LOS and NLOS conditions. In particular, for NLOS scenarios with complex diffraction mechanisms, it outperforms the 3GPP and simplified models, reducing the RMSE by 7.1 dB and 3.18 dB, respectively. Doppler analysis further demonstrates its accuracy in capturing time-varying propagation characteristics, confirming the scalability and generalization capability of the model in urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate mental workload assessment of lower-limb exosuits, particularly relevant for mobility-impaired individuals, using both subjective and objective physiological metrics.

Method: Experiments with 18 healthy subjects walking while performing mathematical tasks (double-task condition), comparing NASA-TLX questionnaire, average percentage change in pupil size, and Baevsky stress index.

Result: Complex interaction between task difficulty, exoskeleton activation, and pupillary dynamics; pupil diameter correlates with NASA-TLX; right eye more sensitive to cognitive load; stress index shows discordant responses.

Conclusion: Pupil diameter may serve as objective mental workload indicator, but different physiological metrics respond differently to various stimuli, with ocular asymmetry observed.

Abstract: Lower-limb exosuits are particularly relevant for individuals with some degree of mobility impairment, such as post-stroke patients or older adults with reduced movement capabilities. This study aims to investigate the mental workload (MWL) assessment of XoSoft, a lower-limb soft exoskeleton, using and comparing subjective and objective physiological metrics. The NASA-TLX questionnaire, the average percentage change in pupil size (APCPS), and the Baevsky stress index (SI) are compared. The experiments were conducted on 18 healthy subjects while walking and involved mathematical tasks to create a double-task condition. The results show a complex interaction between task difficulty, exoskeleton activation, and pupillary dynamics, suggesting that the subject might reach a saturated condition under a high mental load. Besides, the data indicate that pupil diameter may be an objective mental workload indicator that correlates with subjective NASA-TLX questionnaires. The discordant indications from the stress index suggest how different metrics of the ocular and cardiac levels respond differently to various stimuli and dynamics. Research has also revealed ocular asymmetry, with the right eye more sensitive to cognitive load.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DkS is NP-hard and difficult to approximate, but penalty-based continuous relaxations have shown practical success for real-world instances.

Method: Develops a penalized reformulation using error bound principle, with a non-convex proximal gradient algorithm where the proximal operator has closed-form solution and low per-iteration complexity.

Result: Achieves favorable balance between computation cost and solution quality on large-scale DkS and Dk1k2BS instances, with convergence analysis provided.

Conclusion: The proposed continuous penalization approach enables exact solutions to DkS using efficient first-order methods with theoretical guarantees for both global and local optima matching.

Abstract: Given an undirected graph and a size parameter $k$, the Densest $k$-Subgraph (D$k$S) problem extracts the subgraph on $k$ vertices with the largest number of induced edges. While D$k$S is NP--hard and difficult to approximate, penalty-based continuous relaxations of the problem have recently enjoyed practical success for real-world instances of D$k$S. In this work, we propose a scalable and exact continuous penalization approach for D$k$S using the error bound principle, which enables the design of suitable penalty functions. Notably, we develop new theoretical guarantees ensuring that both the global and local optima of the penalized problem match those of the original problem. The proposed penalized reformulation enables the use of first-order continuous optimization methods. In particular, we develop a non-convex proximal gradient algorithm, where the non-convex proximal operator can be computed in closed form, resulting in low per-iteration complexity. We also provide convergence analysis of the algorithm. Experiments on large-scale instances of the D$k$S problem and one of its variants, the Densest ($k_1, k_2$) Bipartite Subgraph (D$k_1k_2$BS) problem, demonstrate that our method achieves a favorable balance between computation cost and solution quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of conventional MIMO systems and baseline PASS with fixed power radiation, enabling simultaneous optimization of energy harvesting for EHRs and communication quality for IDRs.

Method: Bi-level optimization with upper level maximizing power conversion efficiency under rate constraints, and lower level maximizing sum rate. Uses alternating optimization, WMMSE, and QT-LDT algorithms for two-user and multi-user scenarios.

Result: Achieves 81.45% and 43.19% improvements in PCE for EHRs, and 77.81% and 31.91% increases in sum rate for IDRs compared to conventional MIMO and baseline PASS respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed PASS-WPT framework significantly outperforms existing approaches by flexibly adjusting power radiation ratios to enhance both energy harvesting and communication performance.

Abstract: A novel pinching antenna system (PASS) enabled wireless power transfer (WPT) framework is proposed, where energy harvesting receivers (EHRs) and information decoding receivers (IDRs) coexist. By activating pinching antennas (PAs) near both receivers and flexibly adjusting PAs' power radiation ratios, both energy harvesting efficiency and communication quality can be enhanced. A bi-level optimization problem is formulated to overcome the strong coupling between optimization variables. The upper level jointly optimizes transmit beamforming, PA positions, and feasible interval of power radiation ratios for power conversion efficiency (PCE) maximization under rate requirements, while the lower level refines power radiation ratio for the sum rate maximization. Efficient solutions are developed for both two-user and multi-user scenarios. 1) For the two-user case, where an EHR and an IDR coexist, the alternating optimization (AO)-based and weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE)-based algorithms are developed to achieve the stationary solutions of transmit beamforming, PA positions, and power radiation ratios. 2) For the multi-user case, a quadratic transform-Lagrangian dual transform (QT-LDT) algorithm is proposed to iteratively update PCE and sum rate by optimizing PA positions and power radiation ratios individually. Closed-form solutions are derived for both maximization problems. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PASS-WPT framework significantly outperforms conventional MIMO and the baseline PASS with fixed power radiation, which demonstrates that: i) Compared to the conventional MIMO and baseline PASS, the proposed PASS-WPT framework achieves 81.45% and 43.19% improvements in PCE of EHRs, and ii) also increases the sum rate by 77.81% and 31.91% for IDRs.

Conclusion: The SynthSoM-Twin dataset enables effective Sim2Real transfer, significantly reducing the need for real-world data collection while maintaining or improving model performance through proper simulation-real data integration.

Abstract: This paper constructs a novel multi-modal sensing-communication digital-twin dataset, named SynthSoM-Twin, which is spatio-temporally consistent with the real world, for Sim2Real transfer via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). To construct the SynthSoM-Twin dataset, we propose a new framework that can extend the quantity and missing modality of existing real-world multi-modal sensing-communication dataset. Specifically, we exploit multi-modal sensing-assisted object detection and tracking algorithms to ensure spatio-temporal consistency of static objects and dynamic objects across real world and simulation environments. The constructed scenario is imported into three high-fidelity simulators, i.e., AirSim, WaveFarer, and Sionna RT. The SynthSoM-Twin dataset contains spatio-temporally consistent data with the real world, including 66,868 snapshots of synthetic RGB images, depth maps, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, millimeter wave (mmWave) radar point clouds, and large-scale and small-scale channel fading data. To validate the utility of SynthSoM-Twin dataset, we conduct Sim2Real transfer investigation by implementing two cross-modal downstream tasks via cross-modal generative models (CMGMs), i.e., cross-modal channel generation model and multi-modal sensing-assisted beam generation model. Based on the downstream tasks, we explore the threshold of real-world data injection that can achieve a decent trade-off between real-world data usage and models' practical performance. Experimental results show that the model training on the SynthSoM-Twin dataset achieves a decent practical performance, and the injection of real-world data further facilitates Sim2Real transferability. Based on the SynthSoM-Twin dataset, injecting less than 15% of real-world data can achieve similar and even better performance compared to that trained with all the real-world data only.
